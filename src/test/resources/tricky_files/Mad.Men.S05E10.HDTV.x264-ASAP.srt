Financial Chief.

3
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:06,743
You should have one
give me a call.

4
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:11,065
I never tried as hard at acting
as I did for advertising.

5
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:14,303
I only want to ensure that
Niegel is enrolled in the fall.

6
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:18,208
Niegel's enrollement isn't an issue
wether we pay or not.

7
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,299
If I walk out that door, that's it.

8
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,180
That's it.

9
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:27,410
Your activities last night
have costed us this account.

- Hello? - <i>I apologize for the hour.</i>
You instructed me to avoid your officers.

<i>But we have good news.</i>

The hansard procedure
negotiations

18

have concluded as promised.

19
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,297
You need only wire
the full £2,900 by Thursday

20

<i>and your slate will be clear</i>

22
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,837
Your promise
was to extricate me

23
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,472
from this situation altogether.

24
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,606
My promise was to keep you
out of prison.

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,942
Thursday...

26
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,012
How am I supposed to find
$8,000 in two days?

27
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:48,214
That's not possible.
That's no help at all.

28
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:51,851
Look, Lane, you gave her majesty's
portion to a foreign power

29
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:55,220
and the tax man is keen to make
an example of an expatriate.

30
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:58,757
<i>This is the very best news</i>

What are you doing out here?

34
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:13,737
Uh, business.
Go back to bed, dear.

35
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:16,807
- What are you looking for?
- Go back to bed this minute!

No.

Mr. kinsey called
regarding lunch.

40
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:36,159
- What does he want?
- I think he wants to have lunch.

41
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:38,795
- What's wrong with him? He's very polite.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,064
You should have seen him
at Ken's bachelor party.

43
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,433
- I think he was on LSD.
- Really?

44
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:48,270
Well, he's sort of been
threatening to "spot" by.

45
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:50,239
Scarlett, here you are.

46
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,574
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Pryce.
Do you need me?

47
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:55,677
Only in that I wanted you
to direct me to Mr. Crane.

48
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:57,546
Please leave us.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,314
I'll meet him for coffee.

50
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,018
I was hoping we could discuss

51
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,020
the first quarter
media projections.

52
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:07,922
Sure.

53
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,429
These numbers
are very positive.

54
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,230
Theyojections.

55
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,967
They're derived from reality,
but they're hopes and dreams.

56
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,534
January and february$
look great--

57
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,137
Heinz, Mohawk, Vicks,
all pretty stable.

58
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:25,839
When will they become
commitments?

59
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,307
I can't predict
the future, Lane.

60
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,109
I don't know what the
Russians are going to do.

61
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,043
We may be living underground
by Lincoln's birthday.

62
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,678
Mm.

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,982
Hey, that's my only copy.

64
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,621
Walt: <i>Hope you don't need
any actual paperwork</i>

65
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,457
because everything's
out by my desk

66
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,225
and my desk is out by Chuck.

67
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,860
How's Rebecca?

68
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,629
About the same--
Underfed and underpaid.

69
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,131
And Laura?

70
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,700
She calls me durifg
the day and she's peachy.

71
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,568
But I come home and she's blue.

72
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,505
- To the holidays.
- Cin cin.

73
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,374
So, Walt, o you think

74
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,709
about extending
our credit by $50,000?

75
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:09,846
I didn't know we were going
to talk real business.

76
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,249
Should I slow down?

77
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:15,185
( Chuckles )

78
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,722
<i>Well, ahem,</i>
<i>the projections suggest--</i>

79
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:22,958
No projections.
We're only interested in commitments.

80
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,894
Yes, well,
the commitments are firm,

81
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:27,430
but no one's been paying
their bills on time.

82
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:30,866
Hmm, I got it.
Done.

83
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:34,137
Are you going away?

84
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:36,704
No. I love Christmas
in Manhattan.

85
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:38,306
Can you take care of it today?

86
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,208
I'd like to start writing
checks immediately.

87
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:41,510
Sure.

88
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:43,578
We're heading to Florida.

89
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:46,814
I want to fly, but I think
we're going to drive.

What's the hurry, Harry?

92
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,803
Are you drunk?

93
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,339
- Pearl Harbor day. Show some respect.
- <i>( Toilet flushes )</i>

How are you doing

00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:17,910
Remember Lane's fool
at Jaguar, Edwin Baker?

96
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:20,680
- You mean Bazooka Joe?
- ( All laugh )

97
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:23,682
Three weeks ago, he was
replaced by Hugh Hibbert,

98
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,117
and we are back in the running.

99
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:27,652
- He called you?
- No, I called him.

100
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:29,888
In fact, I've been working
a few prospects over there

101
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,291
for months, waiting for
Edwin to self-destruct,

102
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,792
and he did...

103
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,760
Spectacularly, apparently.

104
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:38,797
He vomited in the lap of the
head of the dealers association.

Who else?

107
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:46,170
Well, it sounds like foote,
cone, Ted Bates, d'arcy.

108
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,073
Everyone who doesn't
have a car.

109
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,675
- What is that, nine of us?
- No, it's five.

110
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,143
And size-wise,
we're the smallest,

111
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,178
so let's all start boning up
on the wonders of Jaguar.

112
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,679
We have a meet
and greet next week

113
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:57,615
and the presentations
are sometime in mid-January.

Yes. You may have
to stay past 5:30.

00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,179
Roger's not coming.
He's on battleship row.

164
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,481
But I've already told him.

165
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,783
I called this meeting.

166
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,517
Where's Joan?

167
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,720
It's best Joan's not heard
for my announcement.

168
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,455
I don't know about yours.

169
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,126
Go ahead.

170
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,827
Very well.

171
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,730
A recent pass of the books
shows that we have

172
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,533
a surplus of $50,000,

173
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:41,402
r and I believe that enables us

174
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:44,572
to distribute
Christmas bonuses.

175
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:46,741
Equal shares to full partners,

176
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,442
half shares to juniors,

177
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:52,079
2% gifts to SNC and 4% ENC.

178
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:55,415
God bless us, everyone.

179
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:57,818
And I shall see to it that the
checks are distributed immediately.

180
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:00,788
Actually, let's wait
till the Christmas party.

181
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:02,756
Someone's not gointo be happy,

182
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,792
and I'd rather not stare
at her for a month.

183
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,827
( Laughs ) Approved.

184
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:09,428
- Don-- - I have to announce that
we're in the running--

185
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:12,531
I mean absolutely
this time-- For Jaguar.

186
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,700
So it's time we all
get some learning

187
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,635
on this fine automobile.

188
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,737
I intend to drive
the mark ii this afternoon.

189
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:23,509
Don, don't you think
the bonuses would make

190
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,977
more of an impact now, hmm?

191
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,146
There's nothing like
a surprise for morale.

192
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,547
Not my morale.

193
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,184
The Jaguar announcement
should be good for morale.

194
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,219
And, as much as
it affects me personally,

195
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:36,021
I think we should sit tight
on the bonuses.

196
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,190
Jaguar will provide
only a little seed

197
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,258
- and we'll have to supplement.
- Damn it!

198
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:43,694
We can afford to do both.

199
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:46,463
- What ghost visited you, Ebenezer?
- Don: <i>Pete.</i>

200
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,665
You asked me to stop
this last time.

201
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,201
Yes, well, other than Roger,

202
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:53,237
who started drinking
at exactly 7:55 this morning,

203
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:56,807
no one has given me
the reaction I desire

204
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,607
from this blessed event.

205
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:00,310
Bert.

206
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:03,612
They're lemons.
They never start.

207
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,815
Meeting adjourned.

208
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,808
You like my shirt?

209
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:16,877
It's very festive.

210
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:18,911
You know it's sacrilege
to say this,

211
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:23,182
but pearl harbor
was an act of genius.

212
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:25,752
The only thing they didn't
plan for was success.

213
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:29,088
The japs won and they didn't
know what to do with it.

214
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:32,258
Mr. Sterling,

215
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,026
seeing as you're
dressed for fishing,

216
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:36,128
you'll have more success
if you're quiet.

217
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,366
Don't be like that.

218
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,568
I couldn't care less.

219
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,470
Ahi I know why you're mad.

220
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:50,075
But Jane's not going
to take everything.

221
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,143
It never oururretotoe.

222
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,746
- Have I asked?
- No.

223
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,748
And you shouldn't
have to and you don't

224
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,250
and you keep sending it back.

225
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,751
Because it's
a short-term solution.

226
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,188
- I told you, I'll cover Kevin
through college. - No.

227
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:05,923
It's better this way for him.

228
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,456
And if you're not careful,

229
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,458
you won't even be
a family friend.

230
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:12,162
- Joanie, I had an experience.
- I know, Roger.

231
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,963
Well, it's not about honor.

232
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:19,102
It's about the fact that
we created a human life.

233
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,171
We made a baby.

234
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,138
Yes.

235
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:26,241
And now it's some other
lucky girl's turn.

236
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:30,679
Scarlett.

237
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:34,616

My head is humming.

00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,878
And your mind is clear.

247
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,679
Yeah.

248
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:08,248
I should be getting back.

249
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:10,950
Holy shit, how long
have I been here?

250
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:14,053
- Are you hungry?
- I am.

251
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,488
Paramatma, take him
for some food.

252
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,690
Yes, mother lakshmi.
A beautiful idea.

253
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:21,593
- Harry, will you eat with me?
- Just the two of us?

254
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:25,597
- Hare krishna.
- Hare krishna.

255
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,934
Guru:
<i>But when we are</i>

<i>conditional life,</i>

257
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:35,706
we forget this, hmm?

258
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:39,310
<i>( Car horns honking )</i>

259
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:41,246
It is so good to see you.

260
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,114
It's good to see you, too.

261
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:46,149
But I'm not gonna join.

262
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,885
I don't want you

263
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,720
but I can tell
you really got into that.

264
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:53,023
I can tell you really
got into Lakshmi.

265
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:55,492
I love her deeply, Harry.

266
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,295
Absolutely.
She's my kind of religion.

267
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:59,929
It's not like that.

268
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:02,198
Lakshmi lived most of her
life as a girl named Janet

269
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:05,434
whose promiscuity led
to drugs and prostitution.

270
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,503
The movement saved her life.

271
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,338
So what's your excuse?

272
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,575
I was at rock bottom.

273
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,111
I had really degraded myself.

274
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:18,413
- At mccann?
- No, damn

275
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:22,317
listen, I love what the
movement has given me,

276
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:26,354
but I don't understand why I have
to live like that to love God.

277
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,189
Are they making you stay?

278
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,925
It's just Lakshmi.

279
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,727
- So you don't wanna share, huh?
- You don't understand.

280
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:36,897
I want to make a life
with her, but not there.

281
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,166
So what does that
have to do with me?

282
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,469
She was a runaway,
and she won't leave

283
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:44,905
unless she knows she won't
wind up back on the streets.

284
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,473
You want money.
( Scoffs )

285
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:48,074
You know go eat by yourself.

286
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:49,575
Stop, stop.

287
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,244
Money solves today,
not tomorrow.

288
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:52,946
- Up here on the right.
- <i>( Brakes squeak )</i>

289
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,449
And for your information,
Prabhupad is buying.

290
00:13:58,285 --> 00:14:00,286
I'm sorry I said

291
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:02,755
I couldn't come
because of the accident.

292
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,656
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,524
Excuse me.

294
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,666
Man: <i>"Can you help me,</i>
<i>doctor?" I asked him.</i>

295
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,503
"Well, it started--
Well, it started," I said,

296
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:22,106
"when I was sitting in front
of the television set

297
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,108
with my feet
on the coffee table.

298
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:27,211
<i>Now, I've sat there</i>
<i>hundreds of times,</i>

299
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,947
<i>thousands maybe, with a
can of beer in my hand.</i>

300
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:32,149
I like to have
a can of beer in my hand

301
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:34,352
when I watch the beer ads.

302
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:37,387
But now, for no reason
I could think of,

303
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:40,156
the ad was making me sick.

304
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:43,793
So I used the remote control
to get to another channel,

305
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:47,130
but each channel
made me just as sick.

306
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:49,199
<i>The television was one thing,</i>

307
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:52,401
<i>and I was a person,</i>
<i>and I was going to be sick.</i>

308
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:54,470
So I turned it off

309
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:56,638
<i>and had a panicky moment.</i>

310
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:58,840
<i>I smelled the beer in my hand.</i>

311
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,643
<i>And as I vomited, I looked</i>
<i>around the living room</i>

312
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,578
<i>for something</i>
<i>to grab onto."</i>

313
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:08,282
- Do you want something to eat?
- Nope.

314
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:14,755
Well, I didn't have dinner.

315
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,426
- You want a drink?
- Yep.

316
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,128
"Yep. Nope."

317
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:22,130
Should have been
our wedding vows.

318
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:24,531
I'm just tired.

319
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,166
No, you're not.

320
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,436
I don't understand.

321
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,140
I've heard you say a lot worse
things about advertising.

322
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:35,575
The mighty theater punches
its audience in the face

323
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:38,945
with its subtle message--
There's a challenge.

324
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,946
Let me tell you,
people buy things

325
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,515
because it makes them
feel better.

326
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:44,350
Well, we could have had
dinner with Charles.

327
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:46,718
He's an understudy.
That may be his only performance.

328
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,320
I mind picking up
the check for your friends,

329
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,722
- but not if they insult me first.
- I'm sorry.

330
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:53,825
People make fun of acting
all the time and you love it.

331
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,162
And I didn't think it was such a
strong stand against advertising

332
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:59,364
as much as the emptiness
of consumerism.

333
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,066
Well, no one's made
a stronger stand

334
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,201
against advertisinthan you.

335
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:12,776
<i>( Instrumental music playing )</i>

336
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,844
You know, I was scared
when bea was born,

337
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,115
but she's such a joy.

338
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,185
I actually saw her face float
by while I was chanting.

339
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:24,421
Really?
You had a vision?

340
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:26,790
I guess.

341
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:31,461
And you kind of think you're
tied to this person forever.

342
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:34,130
Noittle girl.
You know, Jennifer.

343
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:35,731
And now with another one
on the way...

344
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:38,801
I want a finfly with Lakshmi.

345
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,636
And a farm,
maybe outside Frisco.

346
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,871
You're gonna have to do
a little less recruiting

347
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:44,539
and a little more working.

348
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:46,408
About that...

349
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:48,910
I don't have a job for Paul.
I've thought about that.

350
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:50,545
It's the whole reason
I didn't wanna see you.

351
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,681
But you can help me
because I have been working.

352
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:58,653
You've been writing?

353
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,455
I think this is the most meaningful
work I've ever done in my life.

354
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:07,293
It's a speculative episode
of the hit television show Star Trek.

355
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,698
- Are you kidding me? - I think it should
be their season opener next year.

356
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,434
If there is one.

357
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,603
It's a tough time slot--
"My Three Sons," "Bewitched."

358
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,838
- At thing's a juggernaut.
- It'll be there.

359
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,440
Where the hell do you watcd it?

360
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,807
Through the window of a
Pizza Parlor on MacDougal.

361
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,544
- What, do you lip-read?
- I've seen the show,

362
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,747
and I think I've made a good effort
at matching the moral complexities

363
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,782
tinged with adventure
that draw people to it.

364
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,085
Just read the first 15 pages.

365
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,854
If you don't think it's good
enough for network television,

366
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,023
then you don't have to pass it
along to the executives at NBC

367
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:42,527
or even think about trying
to get it to Mr. Roddenberry.

368
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,962
That's kind of a line
you don't cross, Paul.

369
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,097
Who do you think
you're talking to?

370
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,168
How much do you buy at nbc?
You don't have any leverage?

371
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,171
Okay.

372
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,339
- Is it about hare krishna?
- No.

373
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,409
Well, not literally, but they
don't tell literal stories.

374
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:05,215
Look, you had a vision
your first time.

375
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,985
Not that I wasn't in a state of
bliss for the first few months,

376
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,187
but something happened.

377
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:12,188
I try to clear my head,
but I can't.

378
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:14,390
It's too busy in there.

379
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:17,760
Everybody else looks so happy.

380
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:20,163
You know, I got there and I
started trying to figure out

381
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:21,664
who prabhupad likes best.

382
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,400
<i>It's the same</i>
<i>as everywhere I go.</i>

383
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:27,736
He doesn't like me.
No one likes me.

384
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,273
Sometimes I think krishna
doesn't even like me.

385
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:33,342
No one but Lakshmi.

386
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,380
Will you read the script?

387
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,912
( Sighs )

388
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,544
( Sighs )

389
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:30,852
Can I ask you something?

390
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,688
Why didn't you bring in
Paul Kinsey when you*?

391
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:34,155
He wasn't submitted.

392
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,090
- You didn't consider him?
- Was I supposed to?

393
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,226
As far as I know,
he was at McCann,

394
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,830
and then Y&R, then he rolled
downhill through K&E and B&B.

395
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:45,399
And last thing I heard,
he was in-house at AMP.

396
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:49,136
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
<i>The</i> AMP.

397
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:53,707
Will you read a script
he wrote for "Star Trek"?

398
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:55,475
Harry, if he asked you
to pass it along,

399
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,043
I don't think
this is what he meant.

400
00:20:57,077 --> 00:21:00,380
I know what he meant,
but I need a second opinion.

401
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:07,686
Is it going to give me a case
of the "Nee-groan Complex"?

402
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,755
It's really bad.

403
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,924
And it's pronounced "neh-grahn"
because it rhymes with katahn,

404
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,361
which the negron pick under
slavery to the caucasons.

405
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:17,062
That's a twist.

406
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:21,166
- No, the twist is that the negron are white.
- ( Laughs )

407
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,869
Great. Now I'm not
gonna get anything done.

408
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:26,671
He really hopes
this will change his life.

409
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,172
What am I gonna do?

410
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:30,475
You really wanna
help him, don't you?

411
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:34,011
So what?
Really, do you know how lucky we a

412
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:37,815
well, if you really wanna
help, be honest with him

413
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,850
and tell him he needs
to write a better script.

414
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:41,885
I think it was
really hard for him.

415
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,987
Then he shouldn't be doing it.

416
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:51,762
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>Mr. Campbell to see you.</i>

417
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:01,737
Send him in.

418
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:04,907
So what's your favorite Jaguar?

419
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,309
Did you send over a packet?

420
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:09,278
No, I drove them.

421
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:10,780
Well, someone drove me.

422
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:12,580
I don't know how to
operate a stick shift.

423
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,181
I'll go this afternoon.

424
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,051
See that you do, because your
opinion means a lot more than mine.

425
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,621
Take Megan.
See how they deal with a couple.

426
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:22,156
We'll see.

427
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,294
You know, if I told you last December
that we'd be in the running for a car,

428
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:28,128
you would have
kissed me on the mouth.

429
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,697
Maybe you and I should
go as a couple.

430
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,373
Man:
<i>Well, that is good to hear.</i>

431
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:43,609
Pity having to deplete
the resources this time of year,

432
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:45,445
<i>but it had to be done.</i>

433
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,180
I've been assured the funds
should be accessible immly.

434
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:49,682
<i>Very well.</i>

435
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:51,984
There is the matter of my fee.

436
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:54,954
Yes, of course.

437
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:57,089
After the holidays?
Good day.

438
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:01,359
( Sighs )

439
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,428
Joan, you have
a guest in reception.

440
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:07,430
He needs a signature.

441
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:14,870
Are you Joan Harris?

442
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,771
Yes, that's me.

443
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,108
- You're served.
- What?

444
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,583
Damn it.

445
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,319
Why did you let him in?

446
00:23:30,353 --> 00:23:33,287
- He said he needed to talk to you.
- About what?

447
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:36,123
I don't remember
everything everybody says.

448
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:38,025
Because you're an idiot!

449
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,127
Don't talk to me like that.

450
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:42,096
Do you understand
having you out here

451
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,598
is the same as having no one?

452
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,500
He said he knew you.
He said it was a surprise.

453
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:48,001
A surprise?

454
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:50,670
Well, thank you for that.
Here's a surprise!

455
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:52,439
- Joan!
- Surprise!

456
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,140
There's an airplane
here to see you!

457
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:55,808
You're not allowed to do that.

458
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:57,810
- Come on.
- Stop it.

459
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:08,120
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

460
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:10,389
- Come with me.
- I'm fine.

461
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:15,026
Oh, don.

462
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,762
Come on, let's go.

463
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:18,464
It's too early for lunch.

464
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,532
- Not going to lunch.
- I don't even have my coat.

465
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:28,172
<i>( Elevator dings )</i>

466
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,722
Look at your watch.

467
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:48,525
Man:
<i>Well, hello.</i>

468
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,994
What brings you in today?

469
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,663
We got tired
of waiting for a cab.

470
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,431
Thought we'd buy a car.

471
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:58,501
Well, let's see if I can
get out of your way.

472
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:01,837
What's this one?

473
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:03,739
It's the mark ii.

474
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:06,041
It's roomy, quiet,
good for a night on the town,

475
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:07,743
but can also
accommodate children.

476
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:09,243
Do you have any?

477
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:12,380
Altogether, four.

478
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:15,650
This is a car
for the American road.

479
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:17,485
It's too much power
for England.

480
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:19,153
They don't have the space.

481
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:22,223
Yeah, plus I hear the dampness is
murder on the electrical system.

482
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:24,091
We've worked that out.

483
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:28,295
Oh, honey.
What's that?

484
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,131
That's the most beautiful
car ever made,

485
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:34,267
the XK-E,
or the E-type.

486
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:36,403
I want one.

487
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:39,673
I'm thinking about paying to
have you drive around in this.

488
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,074
Go get me the keys.
I'll drive her around for free.

489
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:44,577
I'll have to take
you out one at a time.

490
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,312
There's no room for three.

491
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:48,681
Why would we want you along?

492
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:51,183
She really wants me
to take it for a ride.

493
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,885
I can't.

494
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,821
She can drive it herself.

495
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,822
So you're going
to ride with her?

496
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:59,424
Can I?

497
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,727
How much is the car?

498
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,362
That one?

499
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:06,565
$5,600.

500
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,169
Here's $6,000.

501
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:14,104
If we don't come back,
consider it paid for.

502
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,648
I don't know what it is.
That car does nothing for me.

503
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,284
It's because you're happy.
You don't need it.

504
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:31,020
Okay.

505
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:35,124
You do not know how hard I've
tried to ignore this at work.

506
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,264
I know what I'm doing,
I have some control,

507
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:44,333
but then he found a way
to ruin that, too.

508
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,870
You're gonna need to define
some of these pronouns

509
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:50,338
want me to keep listening.

510
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:54,810
Dr. captain Harris served me
with papers in the office.

511
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:56,812
He's divorcing me.

512
00:26:58,014 --> 00:27:00,615
Like he has
the moral high ground.

513
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:05,453
It's hard on a marriage
when you're apart.

514
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:09,156
Really? He loves it.

515
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,594
I'm sorry about that girl,
but, you know...

516
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:16,163
It used to be if someone
needed to see me in reception,

517
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:18,398
they were delivering flowers.

518
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:21,568
Those flowers...

519
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:24,704
God, my first week here I thought
you were dating Ali Khan.

520
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:28,007
My mother raised me
to be admired.

521
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,476
But no flowers from you.

522
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,845
You scared the shit out of me.

523
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:34,112
Burt Peterson told me
you were the one person

524
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,449
in the agency
I shouldn'cross.T

525
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:38,551
he and Freddy had
a standing argument

526
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,052
that you were a lesbian.

527
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:42,287
You think they never
brought that up with me?

528
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:47,025
Well, congratulations.

529
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,661
For what?

530
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:51,796
For getting divorced.

531
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:57,335
Nobody realizes how bad it has
to get for that to happen.

532
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:59,471
Now you get to move on.

533
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:01,305
To what?

534
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:05,876
To start over?

535
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,947
On what date
do you share that news?

536
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,349
Right after you go all the way.

537
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:17,020
You'll find somebody better.

538
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:20,690
You did, didn't you?

539
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:22,758
You found someone perfect.

540
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:24,660
I did.

541
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,032
I feel like
the office misses her.

542
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:34,403
Maybe I should have
kept her at reception.

543
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:36,938
( Both laugh )

544
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,514
Give me some change.
I want music.

545
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:51,553
( Phone rings )

546
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,020
Hello?

547
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:55,589
There's a lakshmi
here to see you.

548
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:58,291
She's got a whole story.

549
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:01,562
Uh... bring her back.

550
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,999
Scarlett, please hold
all my calls.

551
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:15,675
Ah.

552
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:17,544
A pleasure to see you.
I hope you understand.

553
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:20,279
Jennifer wants to be very
thorough in search for a nanny.

554
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:22,515
Thank you, Meredith.

555
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:28,754
If this is some kind of shakedown,
let me stop you right now.

556
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:30,656
I know you're trying
to recruit me.

557
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,624
Can I have a drink?

558
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:34,826
Isn't that verboten?

559
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:37,128
Listen to me.

560
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:39,064
I don't know what it is,

561
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:43,768
but when you were chanting,
I felt this...

562
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:46,671
Intensity, you know?

563
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:49,941
Everywhere on my body...

564
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:52,777
Especially one place.

565
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:55,112
Really?

566
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:56,947
I was in such a state.

567
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:05,388
Stop it. I thought
you were with Paul.

568
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:07,991
Nobody's with anybody.

569
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:11,027
Paramatma does what
he wants and so do I.

570
00:30:11,062 --> 00:30:14,463
It doesn't mean that
we don't love each other.

571
00:30:14,497 --> 00:30:16,865
So there's no reason
for you to say no.

572
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,635
What about the fact
that I'm married?

573
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:23,739
I'm burning for you.

574
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:26,609
Does your wife burn for you?

575
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:34,048
So this is completely allowed?

576
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:50,097
Take me like this.

577
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,038
<i>( Slow music playing )</i>

578
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,806
Not even a little Sinatra?

579
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:03,876
Jimmy Durante.
( Laughs )

580
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:10,549
Look at all these people
dancing to my music.

581
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,288
You wanna dance?

582
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:18,389
I don't think we should.

583
00:31:18,423 --> 00:31:20,091
You sure look like
you wanna dance.

584
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:22,794
You and me in midtown?

585
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:25,363
You with that look
on your face?

586
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:29,067
What look, baby?

587
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:32,770
God, you're irresistible.

588
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:37,374
You know what this woman
said to me once?

589
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:39,943
I like being bad

590
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:41,912
and going home and being good.

591
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:44,748
I bet that stuck to your ribs.

592
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:47,484
It was a disaster.

593
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:50,019
And joyed every minute of it.

594
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:51,754
( Both laugh )

595
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:55,958
God, I miss that.

596
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:01,130
Well, there's a gentleman
over at 7:30

597
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:03,566
who looks like
he wants to dance.

598
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:09,037
Who do you think he is?

599
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:11,472
Advertising?

600
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:16,011
Insurance? Lawyer?

601
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:20,415
And who do you think's
waiting at home?

602
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,318
I bet she's not ugly.

603
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:28,122
The only sin she's committed
is being familiar.

604
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,891
So you think it's all him?

605
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:33,560
Because she can't
giveve him what he wants.

606
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:37,864
Because he doesn't
know what he wants,

607
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:40,433
what he's wanting.

608
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:43,369
He knows.

609
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:46,572
It's just the way he is.

610
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:50,210
And maybe it's just
the way she is.

611
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:00,785
I'm gonna go.

612
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:03,587
I can still dr I think.

613
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:05,957
I can drive.

614
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:07,992
You can stay.

615
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:11,229
I've been sitting with you
since he walked in.

616
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:13,530
Poor me, I struck out.

617
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:15,867
Who's gonna believe that?

618
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:26,442
Carfare,

619
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:28,411
in case it doesn't work out.

620
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:30,847
Mad money.

621
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:34,984
Thank you.

622
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:36,952
Good night, sweetheart.

623
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:39,955
Stand over by the jukebox.

624
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,292
That looked pretty good before.

625
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:53,101
<i>( Engine roaring )</i>

626
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,197
Are you okay?

627
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:12,133
I don't know. I--

628
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,936
My heart's beating
like a rabbit.

629
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,404
Smoking's not gonna help.

630
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:20,506
Don't get all strict on me,
Mother Lakshmi.

631
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,309
But I am strict.

632
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:26,012
I did this for the movement.

633
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:29,382
Good to know,
but I ain't joining.

634
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,218
Although your techniques

635
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:36,122
are more persuasive
than Parma-- Paul's.

636
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:38,724
You're disgusting.

637
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:41,894
I'm only here because I don't
want you shaking his devotion.

638
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:44,663
What?
How does that work?

639
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:46,431
You're the worst
girlfriend in the world.

640
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:48,600
And you're the best friend.

641
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:52,070
That's why you're giving him false
hope for his awful teleplay.

642
00:34:53,873 --> 00:34:56,707
He wants to have
a life with you.

643
00:34:56,742 --> 00:35:00,544
And you know that, even if that
was possible, that's not the way.

644
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:02,280
Well, he doesn't know that.

645
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:04,348
So why don't you
just let him go?

646
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:11,021
Because he's a devotee of the lord.
You're just a ***.

647
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:13,157
You wanna make him
into a gross materialist

648
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:17,161
when he's living
in the spiritual world.

649
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:20,030
And also he's
our best recruiter.

650
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:22,833
I mean, he really can close.

651
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:25,835
So I'm confused. Why did *?

652
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,404
Because you're going
to stay away from him

653
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:32,408
and let him be happy in the
light of krishna consciousness.

654
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:37,914
You thought I was
some confused little girl?

655
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:41,183
I'm tr the only thing I have.

656
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:44,019
But you already gave it away.

657
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:46,789
Ow!

658
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:52,861
Stay away from him.

659
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,999
What do I do about the script?

660
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,436
Tell him the truth.

661
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:05,973
That always works.

665
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:33,766
And you left work at lunch.

666
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,101
Where the hell were you?

667
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:39,104
You wanna get the rolling pin?

668
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:42,375
- What the hell?
- I wanna know where you were.

669
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,443
I left work,
I test-drove a Jaguar,

670
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:48,146
had a drink with Joan, drove around
some more and dropped it off.

671
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:49,982
And you never
thought to call me?

672
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,716
Why did you want me
to think that?

673
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,151
Calm the hell down.

674
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:55,020
I put a plate
in the oven for you

675
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:57,122
and sat here like an idiot,
waiting for someone

676
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:59,424
who doesn't give a shit
about anybody.

677
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,263
- You like to get mad.
- No, I don't.

678
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:08,065
- That's what gets you going.
- That is not what this is.

679
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,768
Now sit down!

680
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:12,537
You're gonna eat
dinner with me.

682
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,196
Do you want any cheese?

683
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:44,400
- No. Do you want--
- I'll clean it up later.

684
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:55,944
You used to love your work.

685
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:59,013
Well, it's different there now.

686
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:02,851
You loved it
before you ever met me.

687
00:38:09,357 --> 00:38:11,492
Rebecca: <i>My mother
is not a good nurse</i>

688
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:14,495
<i>and he hides his symptoms.</i>

689
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:16,630
He's a rugged chap.

690
00:38:16,665 --> 00:38:19,767
I do think more than ever we should
pay them a visit at Christmas.

691
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:22,234
Or I could just take Nigel.

692
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:24,437
Certainly we can afford t

693
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,515
I shouldn't be sharing this,

694
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:38,917
but I truly don't
want you to go.

695
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:43,421
You see, Edwin's left Jaguar.

696
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,057
Oh, that's why
she left in a hurry.

697
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:48,894
If he had been sacked,
he'd have lost his visa.

698
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:53,931
Yes, well, it allowed Jaguar
to come crawling back to me.

699
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:56,133
The firm can't do it without me

700
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,069
and I shan't spend
another Christmas alone.

701
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,138
Oh!

702
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,673
Oh, darling.

703
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:06,878
I'm so happy for you, so proud.

704
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:09,679
Of course we'll be here
by your side.

705
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,749
Christmas in New York
will do just fine.

706
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,633
Don't get excited.

707
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:35,036
Well, get excited,
but they're not from me.

708
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,739
Thank you for delivering them.

709
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:40,441
I had to. The girl in reception's
too scared to bring them back.

710
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:42,944
I also had to sign
for them and tip handsomely.

711
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:48,949
Do you want a tip, too?

712
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:55,789
How many times have I left you alone
with a card from another man?

713
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,103
Hare krishna.

714
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:20,005
Great to see you.

715
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,842
Well, I've been meditating on the
idea that you have good news,

716
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:25,044
especially since
you called me so fast.

717
00:40:25,078 --> 00:40:26,813
Then I realized
it's probably not,

718
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,881
since you wouldn't
tell me over the phone.

719
00:40:32,352 --> 00:40:36,755
I have news,
but it's complicated.

720
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:38,289
They loved it.

721
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,291
They said it was one of the best
scripts they had ever read.

722
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:44,796
- Who? - Uh, the reader at
Mike Weinblatt's office.

723
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:46,565
But he apparently
can't give it to Mike

724
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,167
or anyone over there
because of legal reasons.

725
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,969
And you can never call him because
they've had some lawsuits,

726
00:40:52,003 --> 00:40:55,539
but he said you have a
future and I agree with him.

727
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:57,140
Did you tell him
I'll get a lawyer?

728
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:58,375
I'll sign anything they want.

729
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:01,912
Yes, but he was firmly
diging in every way

730
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:04,849
except in his unbridled
enthusiasm for the writing.

731
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:06,616
Really?
What did he say?

732
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,251
- Can I talk to him? Does he
want to talk to me? - Never.

733
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:11,120
But...

734
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:17,360
S envelope is your future.

735
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:20,497
This is your destiny.

736
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:24,967
- Is it a contract?
- They're not interested...

737
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,702
But I am.

738
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,640
This is $5 a ticket
to Los Angeles.

739
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:34,977
I want you to leave the krishnas
and go out there and try.

740
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:37,778
I don't think Lakshmi--

741
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:41,649
I'm not giving you this
unless you promise

742
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:44,051
to leave your things
and go from here.

743
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,254
I don't have any things.

744
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:51,025
Good.
This is all you need.

745
00:41:52,293 --> 00:41:55,061
You don't understand
what it's like out there.

746
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:59,132
This failure, this life--

747
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:02,736
It'll all seem like
it happened to someone else.

748
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,338
Harry, you don't
understand lakshmi.

749
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:10,709
If you go back there, you'll
never be strong enough to go.

750
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:12,745
And then she'll try
and talk you out of it.

751
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:15,548
And what does that tell you?
It's $500.

752
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:18,450
You can call her on the way
from Philly or something.

753
00:42:42,674 --> 00:42:46,342
You know, all these people said
they'd do something for me.

754
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:48,679
You're the first one
who did anything.

755
00:42:51,783 --> 00:42:53,784
Break a leg.

756
00:43:01,892 --> 00:43:04,126
Everyone's assembling
for the announcement.

757
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,063
Well, there's a little bad
news to go with the good.

758
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:10,700
Mohawk's machinists
are going on strike.

759
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:12,735
Despite the fact
that they're flying,

760
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:14,736
<i>they're suspending</i>
<i>their advertising.</i>

761
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,206
They made so much money
all summer as scabs.

762
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,275
- What's going on?
- Mohawk's on strike.

763
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,944
They're suspending all work.

764
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:24,178
They're not leaving the agency,

765
00:43:24,213 --> 00:43:26,014
but what they save
by cutting the ad budget

766
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:28,216
goes straight to the bottom line,
and it's the end of the year.

767
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:30,584
Well, then there'll be no bonu

768
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:32,552
no!

769
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:36,356
No Christmas bonuses
three years in a row?

770
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,391
I know.

771
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:40,995
They're going to be working all
through the holidays on Jaguar.

Bert: <i>Fine.</i>

773
00:43:42,363 --> 00:43:45,698
Just the partners will defer.

774
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:47,433
Even the junior partners?

775
00:43:47,467 --> 00:43:49,669
Yes, till the end of January.

776
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:52,772
That's prudent.

777
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:55,274
Well, here we go.

778
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:57,877
Don, you up to joining us?

782
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:14,225
Well, we have
a few announcements,

783
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,262
the first of which is that
we have received

784
00:44:18,296 --> 00:44:20,698
some bad news
from mohawk airlines

785
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:23,668
that they will be suspending
their work indefinitely.

( Murmuring )

787
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:29,606
This puts significant financial
strain on the company.

( Sighs )

789
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:34,243
It was our plan to distribute

790
00:44:34,278 --> 00:44:38,581
Christmas bonuses
this year, but... ahem,

791
00:44:38,615 --> 00:44:42,084
quite selflesslythe partnerd

792
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:45,588
to forego their share
in the interests

793
00:44:45,622 --> 00:44:50,326
of rewarding the staff
for a job well done.

794
00:44:53,564 --> 00:44:57,098
You're all getting Christmas
bonuses and we aren't.

795
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:06,408
Now, understand that the
financial straddling required

796
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:09,344
is for a very good reason.

797
00:45:09,378 --> 00:45:11,878
We've been included
in an elite group of agencies

798
00:45:11,913 --> 00:45:14,215
invited to pitch Jaguar cars.

799
00:45:15,483 --> 00:45:18,586
So congratulations.

800
00:45:21,456 --> 00:45:23,156
Anything else?

801
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:25,025
Yes, actually, I'd like
to say something.

802
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:27,127
Would you?

803
00:45:29,263 --> 00:45:31,931
St year at this time,
whether you knew it or not,

804
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,336
I look at the faces
in this room

805
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,405
who have given their all
to this tenuous recovery

806
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,574
and I say...

807
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:45,844
Prepare to take
a great leap forward.

808
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:47,846
Prepare to swim
the English channel

809
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,914
and then drown in champagne.

810
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:56,087
There are six weekends
between now and the pitch.

811
00:45:56,122 --> 00:45:58,724
We are going to
spend them all here.

812
00:45:58,758 --> 00:46:00,458
We will cee Christmas here.

813
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:02,159
We will ring in
the new year together.

814
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,795
And in the end,
we will represent Jaguar

815
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,497
and it will be worth it.

816
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:08,633
Every agency on Madison Avenue

817
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:11,769
is defined by the moment
they got their car.

818
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,704
When we land Jaguar,

819
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:17,006
the world wiw we've arrived.

820
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,675
( Applause )

821
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,484
Creative, in my office.

822
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,521
