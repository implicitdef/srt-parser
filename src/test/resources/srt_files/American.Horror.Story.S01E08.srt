2
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:35,747
No. No.

3
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:38,673
This is wrong.

4
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,282
It's all wrong.

5
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,708
Who are you?

6
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:50,777
What did you do to my house,
my belongings?

7
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:53,479
I'm terribly confused.

8
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,791
These things aren't mine.

9
00:00:56,154 --> 00:01:01,378
These furnishing, the fabrics--
they're cheap.

10
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,948
Vulgar.

11
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,550
They've picked the flesh
off my beautiful home

12
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:10,254
and left the skeleton, the bare bones.

13
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:15,795
How can I comfort you?

14
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:21,768
My baby.

15
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,269
Where's my baby?

16
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:27,174
Is that what you want, a baby?

17
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:29,242
Yes.

18
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,812
I just want my baby.

19
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:56,567
I thought I told you to
throw that thing away.

20
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,142
Oh, you're not talking?

21
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,212
You really want to go
for round two, huh?

22
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:22,662
I love you.

23
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,564
I love you, too.

24

25
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,067
I'm not crazy. She was here.

26
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:51,570
She was here looking at everything,

27
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:52,872
going on about

28
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,807
butterfly wings
and-and the Tiffany glass,

29
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,542
as if she built the house herself.

30
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,177
She must've had a granddaughter.

31
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,278
Marcy, you were on

32
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,363
the same murder tour I was on.

33
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:05,361
He said she killed herself
and her only child was dead.

34
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,955
They do say we all have
a doppelganger, Mrs. Harmon.

35
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:10,200
It feels as if someone
is trying to make me feel

36
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,467
like I'm crazy.

37
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:13,002
Oh, Lord.

38
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:15,493
Moira, how about a calming
cup of tea for Mrs. Harmon?

39
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,761
Don't patronize me, Marcy.

40
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,297
In fact, there is someone
who wants my husband,

41
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:21,532
who wants my life.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,200
You know, cousin Helen went paranoid

43
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:25,336
when she was pregnant with her second.

44
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:29,174
She imagined the stuffed
animals in the nursery dancing

45
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,109
to some dreadful African drumbeat.

46
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:33,211
She thought they were
enacting voodoo on her.

47
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,346
We got her hormones straightened out,

48
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:38,684
and she was right back on
the happy track in no time.

49
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:40,019
There are things in this world

50
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,721
that can't be explained
by the rational mind.

51
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:44,557
I'd love to spend the day
debating the supernatural,

52
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,427
but I've got to pop by
Mr. Escandarian's office.

53
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,828
He's not answering my calls.

54
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,997
And if we don't open escrow,
you're going to have

55
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:52,731
a bigger problem than
your little ghost story.

56
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,033
Hmm.

57
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,602
Or do we think he's a ghost, too?

58
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,703
Marcy.

59
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:03,541
I for one believe in things unseen.

60
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,610
Who knows, Mrs. Harmon?

61
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:09,914
We're all just lost souls, aren't we?

62
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:11,749
Maybe I am going crazy.

63
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:14,085
I feel like I'm going crazy.

64
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:16,820
I feel like I'm going to break
into a million pieces.

65
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,655
He's cheating.
I can tell.

66
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:20,591
How?

67
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,359
He's weird.
He's gotten weird.

68
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:23,560
Weird how?

69
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,795
Weird.

70
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,664
About money, about the renovations,

71
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,566
weird about having a baby.

72
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,201
I'm not sure he even
wants one anymore.

73
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,835
Every time I bring up the subject of

74
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:34,970
a color scheme for the nursery,
he changes the subject.

75
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,039
I don't know why you insist on

76
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:38,540
torturing him with your swatches.

77
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:41,743
The point is, I go out of my way
to make him feel included,

78
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,311
but he's distant, distracted.

79
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,779
He's even been sleepwalking.

80
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,180
Okay, Chad.

81
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:49,550
None of this is exactly
evidence of infidelity.

82
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:51,986
No.

83
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,489
But what I found on his computer is.

84
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:56,858
<i>He usually logs off;</i>
<i>this time he didn't.</i>

85
00:05:56,926 --> 00:06:02,165
<i>He's been carrying on a truly</i>
<i>vile online relationship</i>

86
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:06,536
<i>with some S&M freak who</i>
<i>calls himself "JungleJim4322."</i>

87
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:09,406
<i>I can't even believe</i>
<i>he types those words,</i>

88
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:11,075
<i>let alone does those things.</i>

89
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:13,110
It's completely humiliating.

90
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:15,613
Look, Pat's obviously
got some interests

91
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,182
that he doesn't feel
free sharing with you.

92
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,617
Ugh!
Now, if you don't want

93
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:21,484
to end up sharing him,

94
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:23,720
then you need to make
a preemptive strike.

95
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:24,821
What do you mean?

96
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,355
I mean you have to fight.

97
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:28,191
Pat's a great guy, Chad,

98
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,825
worth fighting for.

99
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:31,594
And if that means
that you have to fight

100
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:32,729
with a cat-o'-nine-tails

101
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,430
and some titty clamps,

102
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:37,067
well, then, brother,
you better gear up.

103
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:42,638
Mike's Spikes makes this
stainless steel ball stretcher.

104
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:45,208
Spikes are fully adjustable.

105
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:49,478
The Ultimate Asslock-- also
known as the Apple of Anguish.

106
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:52,214
Is, uh, any of this working for you?

107
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:55,050
I don't, I don't like pain, so...

108
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:56,285
Okay.

109
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:57,787
Maybe we start with a simple

110
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:00,790
pair of handcuffs.

111
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,158
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:06,295
Um, my boyfriend has been
in these chat rooms.

113
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:07,963
That's always how it starts.

114
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,198
Is he dominant

115
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,232
or submissive?

116
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,169
I don't know

117
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:16,438
I'm usually the one
who calls the shots.

118
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:18,240
Then maybe he wants to be the dom

119
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:19,275
for a change.

120
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:20,409
Huh.

121
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:21,611
Well, that's interesting.

122
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,246
I never thought of that.

123
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:26,049
Every relationship's
a power play, with or without

124
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:27,183
the props.

125
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:29,819
What about a muzzle?

126
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:31,587
He's forever telling
me I talk too much.

127
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:34,189
The muzzle's good.

128
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,057
But if you're feeling brave,

129
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,392
I got just the thing.

130
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,401
The hood's fully detachable,

131
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,602
and the harness has

132
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,371
anchor points for bondage.

133
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:52,740
Forgive me, um,
I don't get any of this.

134
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,242
At all.

135
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,511
The point of the suit is to
dehumanize the submissive,

136
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,412
turn him into

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,514
a rubber sex t.

138
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,582
Why don't you try it on?

139
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,817
Oh, no, no.

140
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,653
I-I don't think I have
the body for that.

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,021
You wouldn't believe
how slimming it is.

142
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,489
Especially in black.

143
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,524
Get the suit.

144
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,591
If it doesn't work out,

145
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,993
you can always wear it for Halloween.

146
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,362
I do love Halloween.

147
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,197
And it is right around the corner.

148
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,188
Decided to go as a sausage
for Halloween this year?

149
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,102
Dude, I'm in the middle of this.

150
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,072
I'm serious.

151
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,708
I hate how that feels against my skin.

152
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:04,911
Take it off,
so we can watch <i>Rachel Zoe</i>

153
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,246
without me worrying
about you passing out.

154
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,485
Why are you being such an asshole?

155
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,553
This turns you on.

156
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,255
I know it does.

157
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,191
Seriously, Chad, depressing sex
is even more depressing

158
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,425
when you try so hard.

159
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,730
Who is JungleJim4322@yahoo.com?

160
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,199
I don't know.

161
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,200
Stop lying!

162
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,234
The lying is worse!

163
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,903
First my phone, now my e-mail?

164
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,271
Have you ever met up with him?

165
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,873
Because if you brought disease
into this house,

166
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,842
I swear to God...
No, never!

167
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,011
And jerking off with
a guy online isn't cheating.

168
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,814
I want you to get out. Go!

169
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,850
Stay at some Motel 6;
it's all you can afford.

170
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,852
You know what, I changed my mind.

171
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,387
Leave the suit on.

172
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,824
It's appropriate considering how
much of a little bitch you are.

173
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,393
I wanted to have a baby with you!

174
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,894
Why are you doing this to me?!

175
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,696
The house, decorating--
I hate it!

176
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:58,266
It's no wonder I don't want
to stick my dick in you anymore!

177
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:00,701
You know what?

178
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,970
Go find JungleJim.

179
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,072
See if he'll redo
every bathroom in this house

180
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,774
to your exact,
nouveau riche specifications.

181
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,577
What are you going to do
when we lose it?

182
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,613
What are you going to
hold over my head

183
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,282
when the bank comes and takes
this place away from us?

184
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,553
You don't think I read our bills?

185
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,023
Our statements?

186
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,830
Where are you going?

187
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:30,264
Out.

188
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:33,301
And for the record,
I like leather, not latex.

189
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:58,594
Good God, woman, you've got
to knock this shit off.

190
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:00,496
I beg your pardon.

191
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:01,797
The crying.

192
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,166
You got to get it under control.

193
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,534
You're making me nuts.

194
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:05,936
I'm very confused.

195
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:07,504
What are you doing in my house?

196
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:09,673
I am stuck here like the others.

197
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:10,741
Like you.

198
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:11,942
We died in here,

199
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,777
and for whatever reason,
we can't leave.

200
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:15,345
What are you implying?

201
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,682
That... that you're dead?

202
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,617
I'm not implying it;
I'm saying it.

203
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,018
Yeah, dead.

204
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,286
Dead as disco.

205
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:26,790
I... I don't understand.

206
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,925
Oh.

207
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:31,127
Of course you don't, honey.

208
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:32,329
But you're not the only one.

209
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:35,500
There are other souls trapped in here.

210
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,470
<i>Innocent, beautiful souls,</i>

211
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:42,607
<i>who never knew malice or anger.</i>

212
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:45,877
<i>It's not fair that they're</i>
<i>trapped in a place like this.</i>

213
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:47,311
It's heartbreaking.

214
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:50,215
Then there are others who
are just in on the game.

215
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:52,150
They're bitches.

216
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:53,284
I don't like you.

217
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:55,520
I don't like your type.

218
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:59,691
You're cheap and horrible
and not half the lady Madame is.

219
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,428
Why you insist on hurting
her is only a reflection

220
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:04,029
of your low character
and lack of breeding.

221
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:07,365
Oh, don't act all high
and mighty with me, you old bat.

222
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,268
I saw you feed her raw brains.

223
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:10,602
That was for her benefit--

224
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,871
to ensure the health
of her unborn babies.

225
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:18,678
Oops. Guess you'll have
to clean that up, huh?

226
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:20,680
<i>We linger here with the living.</i>

227
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:23,716
No rest for them, no rest for us.

228
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,720
It's this place.

229
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,924
It has a hold on us.

230
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,760
But that's not all.

231
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:35,162
There's a power in it.

232
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:36,964
A power we can use.

233
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:40,166
<i>We can make ourselves unknown.</i>

234
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:51,847
<i>And when we really need it,</i>
<i>we can make ourselves known.</i>

235
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,715
<i>And I have such a need.</i>

236
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:57,018
Sometimes I vibrate
with such rage, it terrifies me.

237
00:12:58,855 --> 00:12:59,755
I act out.

238
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,026
You know, my wife Constance
has quite the temper.

239
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:05,394
If she catches us, we...

240
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,463
Yeah, but she never does.

241
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:23,981
<i>If we're supposed to fix</i>
<i>our issues, we never can.</i>

242
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,519
Hey. You want anything
from the kitchen?

243
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:29,387
<i>It doesn't stick.</i>

244
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,993
What you're saying is madness.

245
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,727
I'm not dead.

246
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,096
Then how do you explain
this, sweetheart?

247
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,335
What...

248
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:48,637
What is that?

249
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,639
Looks to me like an exit wound.

250
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,875
My guess is you ate a bullet.

251
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:55,612
And by the looks of those
clothes, it was a long time ago.

252
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,348
Why would I do such a thing?

253
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,188
Was it because of my baby?

254
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:08,027
Where's my baby?

255
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:09,895
Did you lose your baby?

256
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:11,163
Yes.

257
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:12,331
Yes.

258
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,532
I lost mine, too.

259
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:16,168
It was never born.

260
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,670
It's in the backyard
with the rest of me.

261
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:20,306
It's not fair.
No, it's not.

262
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:22,942
How come she gets to have two
and we don't get to have any?

263
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,978
Who?
The bitch that stole your house.

264
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:26,546
Vivien.

265
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:27,914
She already has a daughter.

266
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,249
And what do we have?

267
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,552
Heartache.

268
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,124
She's having twins, you know?

269
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,026
We should take those babies.

270
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:42,530
One for you, one for me.

271
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,666
We could do that?

272
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:47,335
We'll have to.

273
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:51,239
After all,
they've got to have mothers.

274
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,808
You can't raise a baby
in the loony bin.

275
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,771
You're just tired.

276
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,118
Violet?

277
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:45,612
Hello?

278
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,603
Who did that?

279
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,442
What the hell did you do?

280
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,935
He's dead.

281
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:21,701
This is wrong.

282
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:23,907
It's all wrong.

283
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:28,744
Who are you?

284
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,973
What did you do to my house?
My belongings?

285
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:35,807
I know you've suffered a long time.

286
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,301
I'm here to help you.

287
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,369
I need my baby.
Where's my baby?

288
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:43,072
They were fighting and
decided not to make one.

289
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,907
But maybe now a new
family will move in

290
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:47,442
and they can give you what you want.

291
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,911
Yes.

292
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:51,012
A baby.

293
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,748
I just... I want my baby.

294
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,430
You want to play?

295
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:11,765
Come out.

296
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,800
I won't hurt you.

297
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:16,636
Who are you talking to?

298
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:18,971
No one.

299
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,106
Come upstairs.

300
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:22,607
There's something we need to discuss.

301
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,076
A discussion? Oh, shit.

302
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:27,212
<i>I just got off the phone</i>
<i>with Mrs. Levinson.</i>

303
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,681
Violet, you haven't been
in school in two weeks.

304
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:31,650
What is going on?

305
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,620
I don't like it.

306
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:36,522
It's boring, and they bully me.

307
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,224
What does that mean?

308
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,626
That is so you.

309
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:41,061
Some kids say they're bullied

310
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:42,763
and their parents
just pull them right out.

311
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,565
You ask me to define bullying.

312
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,901
Have you told your mom about this?

313
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,936
How is it that a big, fancy shrink

314
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:51,472
hasn't noticed that his wife
has totally lost her shit?

315
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,176
Violet, look at me.

316
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:58,712
Look at me.

317
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,047
What's going on with her?

318
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,449
Well, when she's not in bed

319
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,684
or worrying about
absolutely everything,

320
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:06,287
she's eating raw brains.

321
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,921
Maybe she thinks the twins
are stealing hers,

322
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,156
'cause that's kind of how it seems.

323
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,561
Well, it sounds like, um,

324
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,230
your mom is depressed

325
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,234
and you're feeling
very alone and isolated.

326
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,303
This isn't about me.

327
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,804
I'm saying Mom's crazy
and it's your fault.

328
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:23,306
You drove her crazy.

329
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:25,308
You're a cheater.

330
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,077
Young girls, old ladies
with feather dusters.

331
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:28,645
You're so weird and pathetic,

332
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:30,147
I'm surprised
you haven't gone after me.

333
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:31,982
I'm still your father.
Do not talk to me like that.

334
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,150
I don't have anything more
to say anyway.

335
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,952
Session's over.

336
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,854
Violet.

337
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,265
Madame, are you all right?

338
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:49,800
It's my own fault.

339
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:51,869
I...

340
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:54,138
I read labels on everything,

341
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:56,240
and then, when it really counted,

342
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:58,976
I just... I just followed
directions blindly.

343
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:01,444
My doctor gave me a
prescription last week

344
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:04,914
for a drug for nausea, and...

345
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:07,784
I just checked it
on the Internet, and it says

346
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,922
that it can cause fever
and seizures and, um...

347
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,824
vision changes.

348
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:18,961
That's the only explanation.

349
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,597
For what, Madame?

350
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:23,533
For all the crazy stuff
that's been happening.

351
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,170
And my doctor never even told
me about the side effects.

352
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:30,440
Doctors are charlatans.

353
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:35,779
My mind is playing tricks
on me, Moira.

354
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:41,353
I'm literally seeing things.

355
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,625
There, there, Madame.

356
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,763
You just need a good cry.

357
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,699
Sometimes it's the best
possible thing.

358
00:21:57,337 --> 00:22:00,105
And everybody thinks I'm crazy.

359
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:03,208
I know Ben does.
I know it.

360
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:05,944
And I've been too embarrassed
to call Luke.

361
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,846
That's what men do.

362
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:10,115
They make you think you're crazy

363
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:12,484
so they can have their fun.

364
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:14,020
Haven't you read <i>The Yellow Wallpaper</i>

365
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,487
by Charlotte Perkins Gilman?

366
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:16,722
No.

367
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,024
Her husband, a doctor,

368
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:21,426
locks her away in the upstairs bedroom

369
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:23,662
to recuperate

370
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,098
from a slight hysterical tendency.

371
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:30,570
Staring at the yellow wallpaper
day after day...

372
00:22:30,637 --> 00:22:33,106
she begins to hallucinate
that there are women

373
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:34,775
trapped in the pattern.

374
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,276
Half-mad,

375
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:40,581
she scrapes off the wallpaper
to set the women free.

376
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,884
When her husband finally
unlocks the door,

377
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:47,588
he finds her circling the room,
touching the wallpaper,

378
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:51,058
whispering, "I finally
got out of here."

379
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:54,795
Since the beginning of time,

380
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:58,665
men find excuses to lock women away.

381
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,167
They make up diseases,

382
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:04,971
like hysteria.

383
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,039
Do you know where
that word comes from?

384
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:08,241
No.

385
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:12,279
The Greek word for uterus.

386
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:14,181
In the second century,

387
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,983
they thought it was caused
by sexual deprivation.

388
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:21,155
And the only possible cure
was hysterical paroxysm.

389
00:23:21,223 --> 00:23:23,291
Orgasms.

390
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,161
Doctors...

391
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:30,565
would masturbate women
in their office,

392
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:31,633
and call it medicine.

393
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,336
I had no idea.

394
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:38,507
It was a hundred years ago,
but we're no better off today.

395
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:43,278
Men are still inventing ways
to drive women over the edge.

396
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:47,183
Look at you and
Mr. Harmon--

397
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,618
cheating on you and leaving you here,

398
00:23:49,686 --> 00:23:51,586
pregnant with twins, alone,

399
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:53,488
to care for your
truant teenage daughter.

400
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,056
Any woman would lose her mind.

401
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,792
May I speak freely,
Mrs. Harmon?

402
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,729
Yes.

403
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:04,798
You are not crazy.

404
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:08,802
And the strange things
you are experiencing,

405
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,737
I'm afraid it's not the drugs.

406
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:12,974
I've never said this
to any of my employers

407
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:17,945
for fear of losing their trust
or my job--

408
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:19,246
but this house is possessed.

409
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:23,784
Things break, disappear.

410
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:25,452
Doors open for no reason.

411
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,121
There are spirits here.

412
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:28,622
Malevolent spirits.

413
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:32,024
Mrs. Harmon,
please hear me.

414
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:35,027
You need to get out
while you still can.

415
00:24:35,095 --> 00:24:38,964
I fear for you if you don't.

416
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:41,900
Violet...

417
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:42,967
Violet, wake up.

418
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:45,270
We're leaving this house tonight.

419
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:46,538
We're going to Aunt Jo's.
What?!

420
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:48,674
We're not spending another
night here. Now!

421
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,738
We don't have to be prisoners
to this house anymore.

422
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:20,072
Excuse me, ma'am.
Oh, my God...

423
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,008
I'm hurt, and I need some help.

424
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:24,209
I know you bitches.

425
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,278
Go, Vi! Go!

426
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:28,214
Go!

427
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:39,283
I can't believe
you were trying to take

428
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,450
my daughter out of state.

429
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:42,345
I won't let you do it, Vivien.

430
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:44,715
I will not allow you
to separate Violet from me,

431
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,793
or those babies.

432
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:47,227
You're missing the point, Ben.

433
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,029
The people who tried to murder

434
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,264
your wife and your daughter

435
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,199
were here last night.

436
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,534
The police say there was
no evidence of anyone

437
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:55,469
in that car!
I know what the police said!

438
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:56,870
They don't even think
they're in California!

439
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,705
There was a report of
a similar home invasion

440
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:02,442
in Wisconsin!
They were six inches from my face, Ben!

441
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,211
You've never fully dealt with this.

442
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,213
It makes sense that,
in times of stress,

443
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:08,215
you would feel this way, Vivien.

444
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,584
I swear to Christ, if you're about

445
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,319
to diagnose me with
post-traumatic shock syndrome,

446
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,154
I am gonna bash your goddamn face in!

447
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,157
Fine.

448
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,792
Let's discuss the brain eating.

449
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,163
Let's talk about the dangers
of ingesting raw organs.

450
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,231
Mad cow disease, Vivien.

451
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:24,732
Have you ever heard of that?

452
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,967
If you don't believe me,
go talk to your daughter.

453
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:29,536
Violet was there, too.

454
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,818
Did it hurt?

455
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,152
The first time usually does.

456
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:49,656
No.

457
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:50,824
It was intense.

458
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:53,226
For me, too.

459
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:57,531
You really are here...
aren't you?

460
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:00,567
Of course.

461
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:05,039
I'll always be here,
if that's what you want.

462
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,642
They'll always be here,
too, won't they?

463
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,878
The-- whatever-- others.

464
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,981
They can't hurt us, Violet.

465
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,184
Those freaks who tried
to kill me and my mom.

466
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:17,086
They're dead, aren't they?

467
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:19,155
We saw them outside last night.

468
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,956
My mom's totally freaked out.

469
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:23,325
She thinks they're back to
finish what they started.

470
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,260
I mean, she called the
police and my dad rushed over.

471
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:27,262
They're just trying to scare you.

472
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,597
That's all they can do now.
I wish I could tell my mom that.

473
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:32,534
You can't. You can't.

474
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,102
You can't, Violet.

475
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,137
If you tell anyone what we know,

476
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:37,205
they'll say you're crazy.

477
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,806
They'll want to lock you up.

478
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:40,475
They'll try to
take you away from here.

479
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:43,579
We never see each other again.

480
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:45,481
Violet! Can you come downstairs?

481
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:46,883
- Coming!
<i>- You know what?</i>

482
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:48,218
<i>You can't force us</i>
<i>to stay in California.</i>

483
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:51,088
You can't, 'cause I am
getting out of this house.

484
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:52,156
I am booking us tickets to Florida.

485
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:54,125
I'll go to the courts, if I have to.

486
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:56,595
You're mentally unstable, Vivien.

487
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:57,896
You're seeing things.

488
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:58,930
I'm seeing things.

489
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:01,633
You mean, the way you were seeing

490
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:03,902
your little
ten-year-old mistress?

491
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,005
You're being stupid.

492
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:08,406
The only stupid thing that I did

493
00:28:08,474 --> 00:28:09,674
was not changing the alarm code

494
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,275
after I kicked your ass out of here.

495
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:12,643
Did you give it to her?

496
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:13,744
Is that how she's
been getting in here?

497
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:15,579
Vivien, you're coming unhinged.

498
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:17,247
You never stopped seeing her.

499
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:20,750
You went to Boston to see her,

500
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:23,453
and one of your patients attacked us.

501
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,255
Jesus, Ben!

502
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,724
What the hell are you saying?

503
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,293
Did you plan this whole thing
with your little whore?

504
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:31,930
Did you plan to gaslight me?
Oh, my God...

505
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:33,865
To get rid of me, so she could
come in and take my place?

506
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,467
This is crazy talk, Vivien.

507
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:42,407
What is this?

508
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:43,675
Where did you get that?

509
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,710
It was put somewhere
so that I would see it.

510
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:47,880
Did you tell her about
our kinky night?

511
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:49,515
You put it on for her?

512
00:28:49,582 --> 00:28:51,817
Put it on?!

513
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:53,551
I threw this out months ago.

514
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:56,521
What's going on?

515
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:00,224
Um...

516
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:01,392
honey, would you please just

517
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,494
tell your dad about last night?

518
00:29:03,562 --> 00:29:04,896
Go on, honey.

519
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:05,730
It's okay.

520
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:10,870
I saw Mom really upset.

521
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:13,239
Just tell him what you saw;

522
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:14,774
what you told the police.

523
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:19,947
I told them what I thought
you wanted me to tell them.

524
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:23,316
I didn't see anything.

525
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:25,552
Violet...!

526
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,187
I'm sorry, Mom.

527
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:28,621
I don't know what you saw.

528
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:31,324
You were so upset, so I was upset.

529
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:33,626
I still am.

530
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:36,763
Okay, honey, you can go.

531
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:50,209
I'm staying here tonight.

532
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:52,211
Sleeping in my office.

533
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,047
I don't need your protection.

534
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,315
It's not to protect you.

535
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:56,883
My daughter lives here, too.

536
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:04,325
Aw, look at Little Lord Fauntleroy,

537
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,927
writing sorrowful sonnets in your head

538
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:09,063
to that little nightingale bitch.

539
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,397
"Adieu, nightingale.

540
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:12,866
Thy plaintive anthem fades."

541
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,001
That's Keats.

542
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:16,404
Who gives a shit?
You're like a girl,

543
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:17,572
sulking down here in the basement,

544
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:19,140
instead of doing something

545
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:20,207
about what's really bothering you.

546
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:23,077
I'm tired of hurting people.

547
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:25,546
Do you want her to go away?

548
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:26,514
'Cause Vivien booked their tickets.

549
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:28,282
I heard her.

550
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,917
You know what you have to do.

551
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,519
Yeah, I do.

552
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:35,156
I just have to prepare myself.

553
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,557
It's not fun.

554
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,226
You want to fool around

555
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,694
while you work your way up to it?

556
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:45,000
Come on...

557
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,168
I'm not into it.

558
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,340
What is it about being dead
that makes me so horny?

559
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:54,276
Quit it.

560
00:30:56,212 --> 00:30:58,647
I'm in love.

561
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:04,152
You better locate your balls
before you go in there!

562
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,853
That bitch is tough!

563
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:07,988
What on earth could be so urgent

564
00:31:08,056 --> 00:31:10,257
that I had to leave my
open house in Studio City

565
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:12,092
and drive all the way over the hill?

566
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:16,629
Well, firstly,
I wanted to let you know

567
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:18,731
that Violet and I will be
leaving here tomorrow

568
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,533
to go stay at my sister's for awhile.

569
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:21,568
You couldn't tell me that by phone?

570
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:24,004
Sit down, Marcy, I'm not finished.

571
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:27,809
Where is Mr. Escandarian?

572
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:30,746
We accepted his ridiculous
low-ball offer,

573
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:32,515
and now we have not
received an escrow check.

574
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:34,383
Don't tell me you've screwed
this one up, too, Marcy.

575
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:37,687
You know, Vivien, I have
had it with your abuse,

576
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:40,056
and for your information,
I've called Mr. Escandarian

577
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,290
for two weeks--
morning and night--

578
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,625
the man won't return my calls.

579
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,561
I wasn't here when he
came back to visit.

580
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:47,096
Did you tell him your ghost story?

581
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:49,931
Maybe he laughed and you
bit the man's head off.

582
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,867
Excuse me, Marcy...

583
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,668
I'm not crazy, I'm just pregnant.

584
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:58,639
Oh, God...

585
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:00,875
And nauseous and dizzy.

586
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:02,009
Ugh...

587
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,348
And blinded by migraines.
Mrs. Harmon?

588
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,151
What? What just happened?

589
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,486
Could you get me
a glass of water, please?

590
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,788
Just don't have the baby now.

591
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:13,390
That's the last thing you want to do.

592
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,259
Okay...

593
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:26,504
It's okay.

594
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,106
Oh! Golly...
Here I come.

595
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:29,107
Right here.

596
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:30,141
Oh, thank you.

597
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,108
Yeah.

598
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,180
Oh, boy...

599
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,748
Oh, I'm sorry, Marcy.

600
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:39,616
I think I'm going to have to
lie down for a little while.

601
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:41,485
Of course.

602
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,487
I'll, uh, show myself out.

603
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:45,089
Oh, thank you.
That's wonderful.

604
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,709
You need to be seen by a doctor.

605
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,355
No, it was a through
and through. I'm fine.

606
00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:08,618
What happened?

607
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:11,180
We're fine. As you can
see, I'm in good hands.

608
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:13,116
I want to talk to Mrs. Harmon.
You can't.

609
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:15,239
She's very upset. I gave her a
valium to help her sleep.

610
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:18,119
I'm with Heirloom Security, okay?
I got an emergency alert that...

611
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:20,359
You want an update, Luke?
Vivien thought there was someone in the house.

612
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,383
When I went up to help her,
she accidently shot me.

613
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:23,624
That's the whole goddamn story.

614
00:35:23,692 --> 00:35:26,393
The whole story?
Did you guys talk to Mrs. Harmon?

615
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:27,480
We've got this under control.

616
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,914
So did he tell you that he
doesn't currently reside here?

617
00:35:30,034 --> 00:35:31,865
That they're separated? He did
tell you that, didn't he?

618
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:33,500
You son of a bitch.
Did he also tell you that

619
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:34,534
he has a mistress with
a criminal record?

620
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:35,935
He told you that too, right?

621
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,070
I'm a licensed psychiatrist.

622
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,839
I know a psychotic break
when I see one.

623
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:42,710
My wife is a danger
to herself and to others.

624
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:45,613
So, you want to ship her off
to the loony bin, so you get

625
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:48,149
the house, the kids, the
mistress and the dog, huh?

626
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:50,652
Look, I don't know who you
think you are to my wife,

627
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,153
but this is still my goddamn house.

628
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:54,556
And you need to get the hell out.

629
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:09,339
Wake up!

630
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:21,883
Looking for your lifeline?!

631
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:25,687
Hayden...

632
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:29,558
Hayden, Ben and I are separated.

633
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,059
You can have him all to yourself.

634
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:33,895
I don't want him.
He's pathetic.

635
00:36:33,963 --> 00:36:36,465
I know. I agree.

636
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:38,600
He is pathetic.

637
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:39,869
And he is an asshole.

638
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:43,039
And he is an asshole.

639
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:44,907
And he has hurt us both very badly.

640
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:48,712
And he has hurt us both
so much. So...

641
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:51,081
So you should leave it--
just leave it alone.

642
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:53,517
I can't.
I have...

643
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:56,420
I used to think I was so privileged.

644
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,857
White, beautiful, educated.

645
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:04,262
But I've been deprived.
I have needs.

646
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,965
Terrible, gnawing needs.

647
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:08,099
What do you want?

648
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:12,302
I want what's in your womb.

649
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,804
I want those babies.

650
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:17,040
That's sick.
You're sick, Hayden!

651
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:19,810
No. I'm dead...

652
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:21,211
Dead...! Dead!

653
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,148
And I have a surprise for you.

654
00:37:24,215 --> 00:37:25,649
The father of your babies--

655
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:27,851
he's right there.

656
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:31,656
No! No!

657
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:40,032
He liked it so much the first
time, he's going for round two.

658
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,236
No!

659
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,609
No!
Get off of me!

660
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:50,810
I'm not going to hurt you.

661
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:53,545
I'm not going to hurt you.

662
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:56,648
Where'd he go?

663
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:57,983
I'm right here.

664
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,520
Where is he?

665
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:04,758
Did you see him?

666
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,992
Where did he go?

667
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,629
Who? Who, Vivien?

668
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,568
The-- the guy. The rapist in
the... in the suit.

669
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:15,771
He was right here.
He was right here.

670
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,606
The guy in what suit?

671
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:19,408
Did you get him?

672
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:22,611
Ben knows. He was in
the rubber suit from the attic.

673
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:27,583
And-And Hayden was here.

674
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,385
She said that she--

675
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:31,854
she was dead and she said
she wanted our babies.

676
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:32,921
She's here.

677
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:34,923
Vivien...

678
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:37,025
Hayden!? Did you see her?
Viv...

679
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:38,460
How could you not have seen them?

680
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:39,761
They were here, they were right here.

681
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:43,365
I don't see her, Vivien.

682
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:46,168
Well, they've got to be
in the house somewhere.

683
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:50,739
They're ready for her.

684
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:01,383
What's going on?

685
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,188
I had to do it, Vivien.

686
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:10,092
You're unstable.

687
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,061
No...

688
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:15,298
And you need to be evaluated.

689
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:20,870
These men are going to take
you to a hospital.

690
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:24,175
I'm so sorry.

691
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,043
But it's the best alternative.

692
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,413
I didn't want to do it.

693
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,081
You shot me, sweetheart.

694
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,784
It's gotten dangerous.
But I wasn't shooting you.

695
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:36,955
I was shooting him--
the rapist in the rubber suit.

696
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:47,631
That's not necessary.

697
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,133
Ben, could you get
my coat for me, please?

698
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,909
Thank you.

699
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:06,182
You won't be needing that, ma'am.

700
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,260
Um, I'm so sorry, Vivien.

701
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,429
It's okay.

702
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:21,433
At least I'll be out of this house.

703
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,026
It's all my fault.

704
00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:48,462
No, honey.

705
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,765
It's not.

706
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,100
You did the best thing you could do.

707
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:54,268
You told the truth.

708
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,384
It's okay.

709
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:12,320
I'm here.

710
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,909
Not this way.

711
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:40,882
These boys have family,
friends-- they will be missed.

712
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,251
The police will come
looking for a killer.

713
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:46,188
You want them to find you?
I'm open to suggestions.

714
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,957
I think you should get over

715
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:50,292
you compulsive need to please
the ladies of this house.

716
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,130
I think I have mommy issues.
You know a good therapist?

717
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:56,666
Use this. It belongs to them.

718
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,726
It's kind of romantic, isn't it?

719
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,772
Now they'll be together forever.

720
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:45,452
