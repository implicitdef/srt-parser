- Jim Moriarty.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,520
'Bye!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,880
'Consulting criminal.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,200
'I have loved this,
this little game of ours.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,960
- 'People have died.
- That's what people DO!'

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,400
' I will stop you.'

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,640
If you don't stop prying...

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,560
I'll burn you.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,560
I will burn the heart out of you.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,580
Catch you later.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,120
No, you won't!

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,879
Sorry, boys!

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,639
I'm SO changeable!

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,080
It is a weakness with me,

15
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:56,439
but to be fair to myself,
it is my only weakness.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,320
You can't be allowed to continue.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,759
You just can't.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,359
I would try to convince you,

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,040
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Probably my answer
has crossed yours.

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,919
Do you mind if I get that?

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,599
No, please.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,040
You've got the rest of your life.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
Hello?

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
Yes, of course it is.
What do you want?

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
SAY THAT AGAIN!

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,679
Say that again, and know that
if you're lying to me,

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,460
I will find you,
and I will skin you.

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
Wait.

30
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,639
Sorry...

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,799
Wrong day to die.

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,600
Did you get a better offer?

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,600
You'll be hearing from me, Sherlock.

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,000
So if you have what you say you
have, I will make you rich.

35
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,679
If you don't,

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,759
I'll make you into shoes.

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
What happened there?

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
Someone changed his mind.

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,440
The question is...

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
who?

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,159
Well, now, have you been wicked,
Your Highness?

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,760
Yes, Miss Adler.

44
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,119
What are you typing?

45
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,519
Blog. About? Us.

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,479
You mean me. Why?

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
Well, you're typing a lot.

48
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,399
Right, then.

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
So, what have we got?

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,999
My wife seems to be spending a very
long time at the office. Boring.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,280
I think my husband might be
having an affair. Yes.

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,399
She's not my real aunt,
she's been replaced.

53
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,440
I know she has.

54
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,879
I know human ash. Leave.

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,519
We are prepared to offer any
sum of money you care to mention

56
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,679
for the recovery
of these files. Boring.

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,119
We have this website, it explains
the true meaning of comic books,

58
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,159
cos people miss a lot of the themes.

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,079
But then all the comic books
started coming true.

60
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,720
Interesting.

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,319
Geek Interpreter, what's that?

62
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,640
That's the title.
What does it need a title for?

63
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,839
Do people actually read your blog?

64
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,719
Where do you think our clients
come from? I have a website.

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,020
In which you enumerate 240
different types of tobacco ash.

66
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,319
Nobody's reading your website.

67
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,759
Right then, dyed blonde hair,
no obvious cause of death,

68
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,680
except for these speckles,
whatever they are.

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,319
For God's sakes!

70
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,600
What? The Speckled Blonde?!

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,559
They wouldn't let us see
Granddad when he was dead.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,519
Is that cos he'd gone to heaven?

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,799
People don't really go to heaven
when they die,

74
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,919
they're taken to a
special room and burned.

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,719
Sherlock...

76
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,399
There was a plane
crash in Dusseldorf yesterday.

77
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,959
Everyone dead.
Suspected terrorist bomb.

78
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,719
We do watch the news.
You said "boring" and turned over.

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,199
Well, according to the flight details,
this man was checked in on board.

80
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,319
Inside his coat he's got a stub from his
boarding pass, napkins from the flight,

81
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,080
even one of those special biscuits.

82
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,479
Here's his passport,
stamped at Berlin Airport.

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,199
So this man should have died in a
plane crash in Germany yesterday,

84
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,359
but instead he's in a car boot
in Southwark.

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,119
Lucky escape.

86
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,519
Any ideas?

87
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,240
Eight so far.

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
OK, four ideas.

89
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,960
Maybe two ideas.

90
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,759
No, no, no,
don't mention the unsolved ones.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,359
People want to know you're human.
Why?

92
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,460
Because they're interested.
No, they're not.

93
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:57,559
Why are they? look at that.

94
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,199
1,895. Sorry, what?

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
I reset that counter last night.
This blog has

96
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,599
had nearly 2,000 hits in
the last eight hours.

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,679
This is your living, Sherlock, not
240 different types of tobacco ash.

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,400
243.

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,759
So what's this one?

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,359
Belly Button Murders?

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,520
The Navel Treatment?

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,279
There's a lot of press outside, guys.
Well, they won't be interested in us.

103
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,319
Yeah, that was before you were
an internet phenomenon.

104
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,039
A couple of them specifically wanted
photographs of you two.

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
God's sake!

106
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
John?

107
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,359
Cover your face and walk fast.

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,879
Still, it's good for the public
image,

109
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,279
big case like this.

110
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,280
I'm a private detective, the last
thing I need is a public image.

111
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,239
Hello.

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,200
I think it's time, don't you?

113
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,039
Dear!

114
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,400
Thumbs!?

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,199
The door was...

116
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,920
The door was...

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,160
Boys! You've got another one!

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,679
Tell us from the start,
DON'T be boring.

119
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,999
Hey!

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you OK?

121
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,759
Excuse me!

122
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
Are you all right?

123
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,480
Sir, phone call for you.

124
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,679
Carter.

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,039
'Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?'
Who?

126
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,420
Well, you're about
to meet him now.

127
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,799
This is your case, it's entirely
up to you, this is just...

128
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,359
'..friendly advice, but give Sherlock
five minutes on your crime scene,

129
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,119
'and listen to everything that he has
to say. And as far as possible... '

130
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,520
try not to punch him.

131
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,759
OK.

132
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,319
Sir, this gentleman says he needs
to speak to you... Yes, I know.

133
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,679
Sherlock Holmes.

134
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,360
John Watson. Are you set up
for wi-fi?

135
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,999
'You realise this is
a tiny bit humiliating?'

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,199
It's OK, I'm fine.

137
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,679
Now...

138
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,840
show me to the stream.

139
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,479
'I didn't really mean for you.'

140
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,000
Look, this is a six.

141
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,540
There's no point in my
leaving the flat for

142
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,759
anything less than a
seven, we agreed.

143
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,479
Now go back,

144
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,518
show me the grass.

145
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,720
When did we agree that?

146
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:25,319
We agreed it yesterday. Stop!

147
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,359
'Closer.' I wasn't even at home
yesterday. I was in Dublin.

148
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,040
It's hardly my fault
you weren't listening.

149
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,860
Shut up! 'Do you just carry
on talking when I'm away?

150
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,999
' I don't know, how
often are you away?

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,039
'Now...

152
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,399
'..show me the car that backfired.

153
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,839
It's there.

154
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,880
'That's the one that made the noise,
yes?'

155
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,079
Yeah.

156
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,159
If you're thinking gunshot...
'..there wasn't one.

157
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,400
'He wasn't shot,

158
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:54,839
'he was killed by a single blow
to the back from a blunt instrument,

159
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,439
'which then magically disappeared,
along with the killer.'

160
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,119
It's got to be an eight, at least.

161
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,500
You've got two more minutes,
they want to know more

162
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,879
about the driver.
Forget him, he's an idiot.

163
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,999
Why else would he think himself a
suspect? I think he's a suspect.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,519
'Pass me over.' All right, but there's
a mute button, and I will use it.

165
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,119
Up a bit!
I'm not talking from down here!

166
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,679
OK. Just take it, take it.

167
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,479
'Having successfully committed
a crime without a single witness... '

168
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,199
why would he call the police
and consult a detective?

169
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,799
Fair play? He's trying to be clever.
It's overconfidence.

170
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,380
Did you see him?
Morbidly obese, the undisguised

171
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,959
halitosis of a single
man living on his own.

172
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,380
The right sleeve of an
internet porn addict, the

173
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:36,799
breathing pattern of an
untreated heart condition.

174
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and
a limited life expectancy,

175
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,599
and you think he's a
criminal mastermind?!

176
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,719
Don't worry, this is just stupid.
What did you say? Heart what?

177
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,880
Go to the stream.

178
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,679
What's in the stream?

179
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,399
Go and see. Sherlock!
You weren't answering your doorbell.

180
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,620
His room's through the back,
get him some clothes.

181
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:55,839
Who the hell are you?
Sorry, Mr Holmes...

182
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,460
'Sherlock, what's going on?
' You're coming with us.

183
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,079
'What's happening?' I've lost him.
I don't know what...

184
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,280
Dr Watson? Yeah. It's for you.
OK, thanks. No, sir, the helicopter.

185
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,080
Please, Mr Holmes, where you're
going you'll want to be dressed.

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
I know exactly where I'm going.

187
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,600
You wearing any pants? No. OK.

188
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,279
At Buckingham Palace. Right.

189
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,679
Ha, ha. Aah, aah, I am seriously
fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray.

190
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,439
What are we doing here, Sherlock,
seriously, what? I don't know.

191
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,919
Here to see the Queen?

192
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Apparently, yes.

193
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,479
Just once,
can you two behave like grown-ups?

194
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,680
We solve crimes, I blog about
it, and he forgets his pants.

195
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,879
I wouldn't hold out
too much hope.

196
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,759
I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft.
What, the hiker and the backfire?

197
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,900
I glanced at the police report,
a bit obvious, surely?

198
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:35,039
Transparent.
Time to move on then.

199
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,279
We are in Buckingham Palace, the
very heart of the British nation.

200
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,919
Sherlock Holmes,
put your trousers on! What for?

201
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,519
Your client.

202
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,719
And my client is...?

203
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,479
Illustrious, in the extreme.

204
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,599
And remaining, I have to inform you,
entirely anonymous.

205
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,039
Mycroft. Harry.

206
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,580
May I just apologise for the
state of my little brother.

207
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:05,119
A full-time occupation,
I imagine.

208
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,740
And this must be Dr John
Watson, formerly of the

209
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:10,359
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers?
Hello, yes.

210
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,199
My employer is a tremendous
fan of your blog. Your employer?

211
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,559
Particularly enjoyed the one about the
aluminium crutch. Thank you...

212
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,839
And Mr Holmes the Younger.

213
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,120
You look taller in
your photographs.

214
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,399
I take the precaution of a
good coat and a short friend.

215
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,639
Mycroft, I don't do
anonymous clients.

216
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm used to mystery at
one end of my cases,

217
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,360
both ends is too much work.
Good morning.

218
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,839
This is a matter of national
importance. Grow up!

219
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,599
Get off my sheet! Or what?

220
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,199
Or I'll just walk away.

221
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,919
I'll let you.
Boys, please... Not here.

222
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,199
Who is my client?

223
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,879
Take a look at where you're
standing, and make a deduction.

224
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,399
You are to be engaged by the highest
in the land, now, for God's sake!

225
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,919
Put your clothes on!

226
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,319
I'll be mother.

227
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,120
And there is a whole
childhood in a nutshell.

228
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,920
My employer has a problem.

229
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,420
A matter has come to
light of an extremely

230
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:17,879
delicate and potentially
criminal nature,

231
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,239
and in this hour of need, dear
brother, your name has arisen. Why?

232
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,439
We have a police force of sorts,
even a marginally secret service.

233
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,740
Why come to me?
People come to you for help, don't

234
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,039
they, Mr Holmes?
Not to date anyone with a navy.

235
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,479
This is a matter of the highest
security, and therefore of trust.

236
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,479
You don't trust your own
secret service? Naturally not.

237
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,479
They all spy on people for money.

238
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,560
I do think we have a timetable.

239
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
Yes, of course...

240
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,000
What do you know about this woman?

241
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,879
Nothing whatsoever.

242
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,799
Then you should be paying more
attention.

243
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,879
She's been at the centre of two
political scandals in the last year,

244
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,519
and recently ended the marriage
of a prominent novelist

245
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,599
by having an affair
with both participants separately.

246
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,439
You know I don't concern myself
with trivia.

247
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,760
Who is she?

248
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,919
Irene Adler.

249
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,359
Professionally known as "The Woman".

250
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,719
Professionally?

251
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,240
There are many names for what
she does. She prefers "dominatrix".

252
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,959
Dominatrix. Don't be alarmed.

253
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,439
It's to do with sex.

254
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,840
Sex doesn't alarm me.

255
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,519
How would you know?

256
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,079
She provides, shall we say,
recreational scolding

257
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,119
for those who enjoy
that sort of thing

258
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,119
and are prepared to pay for it.

259
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,880
These are all from her website.

260
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,359
And I assume this Adler woman has
some compromising photographs.

261
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,839
You're very quick, Mr Holmes.

262
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,680
Hardly a difficult deduction.
Photographs of whom?

263
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,999
A person of significance
to my employer.

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,080
We'd prefer not to say
any more at this time.

265
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:31,160
You can't tell us anything?

266
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,640
I can tell you it's a young person.

267
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,440
A young female person.

268
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,439
How many photographs?

269
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,359
A considerable number, apparently.

270
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,540
Do Miss Adler and this
young female person

271
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,719
appear in these photographs
together? Yes.

272
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,880
I assume in a number of
compromising scenarios?

273
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:54,039
An imaginative range,
we are assured.

274
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,719
John, you might want to put that cup
back in your saucer now.

275
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,079
Can you help us, Mr Holmes? How?
Will you take the case?

276
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,119
What case?

277
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,919
Pay her, now and in full.

278
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,239
As Miss Adler remarks in her
masthead, know when you are beaten.

279
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,160
She doesn't want anything.

280
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,600
She got in touch.

281
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:15,079
She informed us that the
photographs existed.

282
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,839
She indicated that she had no
intention to use them

283
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,759
to extort either money or favour.

284
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,959
A power play.

285
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,959
A power play with the most powerful
family in Britain.

286
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,519
Now that is a dominatrix. This
is getting rather fun, isn't it.

287
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,559
Sherlock... Where is she?

288
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,900
In London, currently.
She's staying...

289
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,239
Text me the details, I'll be in
touch by the end of the day.

290
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,260
Do you really think
you'll have news by then?

291
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,279
No, I think I'll have
the photographs.

292
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,920
One can only hope
you're as good as you seem to think.

293
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,040
I'll need some
equipment, of course.

294
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,999
Anything you require,
I'll have it sent...

295
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,220
Can I have a box of matches?
I'm sorry?

296
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:55,439
Or your cigarette lighter,
either will do.

297
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,240
I don't smoke. No, I know you don't,
but your employer does.

298
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,279
We have kept a lot of people
successfully in the dark

299
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,359
about this little fact, Mr Holmes.

300
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,559
I'm not the Commonwealth.

301
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,199
And that's as modest as he gets.

302
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,360
Pleasure to meet you.

303
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:12,640
Laters!

304
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,600
OK, the smoking, how did you know?

305
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,079
The evidence was right under
your nose, John,

306
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,800
as ever you see, but do not observe.

307
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:26,959
Observe what? The ashtray.

308
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,679
Kate?

309
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,999
We're going to have a visitor.

310
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,479
I'll need a bit of time
to get ready.

311
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,159
A long time?

312
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,240
.. Ages.

313
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,599
What are you doing?

314
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
I'm going to into battle, John.

315
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,439
I need the right armour.

316
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,719
No.

317
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,879
Nah.

318
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,319
Works for me.

319
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,319
Everything works on you.

320
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,119
So, what's the plan?

321
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,119
We know her address.

322
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,340
We just ring her doorbell?
Exactly. Just here, please.

323
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,559
You didn't even
change your clothes.

324
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,640
Then it's time to add
a splash of colour.

325
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,199
Are we here?

326
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,439
Two streets away, but this will do.

327
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,719
For what? Punch me in the face.

328
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
Shade?

329
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,159
Blood.

330
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,599
Punch you? Yes, punch me,
in the face. Didn't you hear me?

331
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,959
I always hear "punch me" when you
speak but it's usually sub-text.

332
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,920
For God's sakes!

333
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,360
Thank you, that was...

334
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,439
OK, I think we're done now, John!

335
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,319
You want to remember, Sherlock,
I was a soldier. I killed people.

336
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,600
You were a doctor!
I had bad days!

337
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,519
What are you going to wear?

338
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,119
My battle dress. Lucky boy.

339
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,759
Hello?

340
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,759
Very sorry to disturb you, um,
I've just been attacked, um,

341
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,959
um, and I think they,
they took my wallet

342
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,319
and, um, and my phone.

343
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,399
Please could you help me?

344
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,959
I can phone the police, if you want?

345
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,280
Thank you. Could you, please?
Would you mind

346
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,599
if I just waited here,
just until they come?

347
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,439
Thank you, thank you so much.

348
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,119
Thank you.

349
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,319
I saw it all happen.

350
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,100
It's OK, I'm a doctor.
Have you got a first aid kit?

351
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,879
In the kitchen. Please.

352
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,240
Thank you. Thank you.

353
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,839
Hello,
sorry to hear you've been hurt.

354
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,080
I don't think Kate caught your name?
I'm so sorry, I'm...

355
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,600
It's always hard to remember an alias
when you've had a fright. Isn't it?

356
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,679
Well, there now.

357
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,400
We're both defrocked...

358
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,559
Mr Sherlock Holmes.

359
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,599
Miss Adler, I presume.
Look at those cheekbones.

360
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,159
I could cut myself
slapping that face.

361
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,040
Would you like me to try?

362
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,840
Right, this should do it.

363
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,600
I've missed something, haven't I?

364
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,999
Please, sit down. Or if you'd like
some tea, I can call the maid.

365
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I had some at the Palace.
I know. Clearly.

366
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,200
I had a tea too, at the Palace.
If anyone's interested.

367
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,199
Do you know the big problem
with a disguise, Mr Holmes?

368
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,639
However hard you try,
it's always a self-portrait.

369
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,599
You think I'm a vicar
with a bleeding face?

370
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,719
No, I think you're damaged,
delusional

371
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,880
and believe in a higher power.
In your case, it's yourself.

372
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,279
And somebody loves you.

373
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,440
If I had to punch that face,
I'd avoid your nose and teeth, too.

374
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,879
Could you put something on, please?

375
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,119
Anything at all. A napkin?
Why? Are you feeling exposed?

376
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,679
I don't think John knows
where to look.

377
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,480
No, I think he knows exactly where.

378
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,679
I'm not sure about you.

379
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,599
If I was to look at naked women,
I'd borrow John's laptop.

380
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,799
You do borrow my laptop.
I confiscate it.

381
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,720
Never mind, we've got better
things to talk about.

382
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:17,639
Now, tell me, I need to know

383
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,319
how was it done?

384
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,959
What?

385
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,079
The hiker with the bashed-in head...
how was he killed?

386
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,039
That's not why I'm here.

387
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,199
You're here for the photographs,

388
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,480
but that's never going to happen
and as we're chatting...

389
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:35,759
That story's not out.
How do you know about it?

390
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,559
I know one of the policemen.
Well, I know what he likes.

391
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,039
And you... like policemen?

392
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,920
I like detective stories.
And detectives.

393
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,079
Brainy is the new sexy.

394
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,599
The position of the car
relative to the hiker,

395
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,880
that and the fact that the
death blow was to the

396
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:56,159
back of the head, that's
all you need to know.

397
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,279
OK, tell me,
how was he murdered? He wasn't.

398
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,959
You don't think it was murder?
I know it wasn't. How? The same way

399
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,559
I know the victim was a sportsman,
recently returned from foreign travel

400
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,479
and that the photographs I'm looking
for are in this room. OK, but how?

401
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,400
So they are in this room. Thank you.

402
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:14,920
John, man the door, let no-one in.

403
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,839
Two men alone in the countryside,
several yards apart and one car.

404
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,479
I, I thought you were looking
for the photos now. No, no.

405
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,119
Looking takes ages,
I'm just going to find them,

406
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,440
but you're clever and we've
got a moment, so let's

407
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,759
pass the time.
Two men, a car, nobody else.

408
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,239
Driver's trying to fix his engine.

409
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
Getting nowhere.

410
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,559
And the hiker is taking a moment,
looking at the sky.

411
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,359
Watching the birds? Any moment now,
something is going to happen. What?

412
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,760
The hiker is going to die.

413
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:58,159
No, that's the result.
What's going to happen?

414
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,839
I don't understand.
Well try to.

415
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,559
Why? Because you cater
to the whims of the pathetic

416
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,520
and take your clothes off
to make an impression.

417
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:10,479
Stop boring me and think.
It's the new sexy.

418
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,199
The car's going to backfire. There's
going to be a loud noise. So what?

419
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
Noises are important. They can
tell you everything. For instance...

420
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,599
Thank you.

421
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,039
On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother
would look towards her child.

422
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,840
Amazing how fire
exposes our priorities.

423
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,359
I really hope you don't have
a baby in here.

424
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,679
All right, John,
you can turn it off now.

425
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,639
I said you can turn it off now!

426
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,720
Give me a minute!

427
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,039
Thank you.

428
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,999
You should always use gloves
with these things, you know.

429
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,599
Heaviest oil deposit is always
on the first key used,

430
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,360
that's a 3, but after
that, the sequence is

431
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:10,119
impossible to read.
I see it's a six digit code.

432
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,440
It can't be your birthday,
no disrespect, but you

433
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:14,759
were born in the '80s and
8's barely used, so...

434
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,680
I'd tell you the code right now,
but you know what? I already have.

435
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
Think.

436
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,119
Hands behind your head,
on the floor, keep it still!

437
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,039
Sorry, Sherlock.
Miss Adler, on the floor!

438
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,519
Don't you want me on the floor, too?
No, sir, I want you to open the safe.

439
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,479
American. Interesting.
Why would you care?

440
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,160
Sir, the safe, now, please.
I don't know the code.

441
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:42,839
We've been listening,
she said she told you.

442
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,360
If you've been listening,
you'll know she didn't.

443
00:29:45,361 --> 00:29:47,879
I assume I missed something.
From your reputation,

444
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,439
I assume you didn't, Mr Holmes.

445
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,639
She's the one
who knows the code, ask her!

446
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,160
Yes, sir, she also knows
the code that calls

447
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,679
the police and sets off
the burglar alarm.

448
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,879
I've learned not to trust her.
Mr Holmes doesn't... Shut up!

449
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,519
One more word out of you,

450
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,639
just one and I will decorate that
wall with the insides of your head.

451
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,279
That, for me,
will not be a hardship.

452
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,479
Mr Archer, at the count of three,
shoot Dr Watson. What?

453
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,679
I don't know the code. One.

454
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,999
I don't know the code. Two.
She didn't tell me, I don't know it!

455
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,319
I'm prepared to believe you,
any second now.

456
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,560
Three! No, stop!

457
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,440
Thank you, Mr Holmes.
Open it, please.

458
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
Vatican cameos!

459
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,680
Do you mind? Not at all.

460
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,919
He's dead. Thank you.
You were very observant. Observant?

461
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,999
I'm flattered. Don't be. Flattered?

462
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,680
There'll be more of them, they'll be
keeping an eye on the building.

463
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,800
We should call the police. Yes.

464
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,359
On their way. For God's sake!

465
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,560
Shut up, it's quick.

466
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:51,359
Check the rest of the house,
see how they got in.

467
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,480
Well, that's the knighthood
in the bag. And that's mine.

468
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,580
All the photographs are
on here, I presume?

469
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:03,759
I have copies, of course.
No, you don't.

470
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,239
You'll have permanently disabled
any kind of uplink or connection.

471
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,639
Unless the contents of this phone
are unique, you couldn't sell them.

472
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,319
Who said I'm selling?
Well, why would they be interested?

473
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,220
Whatever's on the phone, it's
clearly not just photographs.

474
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:21,119
That camera-phone is
my life, Mr Holmes.

475
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,359
I'd die before I let you take it.
It's my protection.

476
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,560
Sherlock! It was.

477
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,840
Must have come in this way. Clearly.

478
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,280
It's all right, she's just out cold.

479
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:50,281
God knows she's used to that.

480
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:52,280
There's a back door.
Better check it, Dr Watson.

481
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,240
Sure.

482
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,240
You're very calm.

483
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,079
Well, your booby trap did just
kill a man. He would have killed me.

484
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,800
It was self defence in advance.

485
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,399
What is that?! What?

486
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,439
Give it to me.

487
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,559
Now. Give it to me.

488
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,759
No.

489
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,119
Give it to me. No.

490
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,119
For goodness sake!

491
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,799
Drop it.

492
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,399
I... said... drop it!

493
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,359
Thank you, dear.

494
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,279
Now, tell that sweet little posh
thing the pictures are safe with me.

495
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,239
They're not for blackmail,
just for insurance.

496
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,319
Besides,
I might want to see her again.

497
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,159
No no no no no.

498
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,959
It's been a pleasure.

499
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,919
Don't spoil it.

500
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,599
This is how I want you
to remember me,

501
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,080
the woman who beat you.

502
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,719
Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes.

503
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,479
Jesus! What are you doing?
He'll sleep for a few hours.

504
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,840
Make sure he doesn't choke
on his own vomit, it

505
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:09,199
makes for a very unattractive corpse.
What's this?

506
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,839
What have you given him?
Sherlock? He'll be fine.

507
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,079
I've used it on loads of my friends.
Sherlock, can you hear me?

508
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,480
You know, I was wrong about him.
He did know where to look.

509
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:20,879
For what?
What are you talking about?

510
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,519
The key-code to my safe.
What was it?

511
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,320
Shall I tell him?

512
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,359
My measurements.

513
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,199
Got it!

514
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,880
Ssh ssh no, don't get up,
I'll do the talking.

515
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:02,079
So, the car's about to backfire and
the hiker, he's staring at the sky.

516
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,359
You said he could be watching
birds, but he wasn't, was he?

517
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,079
He was watching
another kind of flying thing.

518
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,400
The car backfires
and the hiker turns to look...

519
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,479
which was his big mistake.

520
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,720
By the time the driver looks
up, the hiker is already dead.

521
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:20,959
He doesn't see what killed him

522
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,559
because it's already being
washed downstream.

523
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,999
An accomplished sportsman recently
returned from foreign travel with...

524
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
a boomerang.

525
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,999
You got that from one look?

526
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,320
Definitely the new sexy.

527
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
I...

528
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,760
I...

529
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,879
Hush, now.

530
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,600
It's OK.

531
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,400
I'm only returning your coat.

532
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,440
John?

533
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,080
John!

534
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,199
You OK? How did I get here?

535
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,559
I don't suppose you remember much,
you weren't making a lot of sense.

536
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,959
I should warn you, I think
Lestrade filmed you on his phone.

537
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,119
Where is she? Where's who?
The woman, that woman. What woman?

538
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,279
The Woman! The Woman, woman!
Irene Adler?

539
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,480
She got away, no-one saw her.
She wasn't here, Sherlock.

540
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,479
What are you?
What? No, no, no. No. Back to bed.

541
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,039
You'll be fine in the morning.
Just sleep.

542
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,279
Of course I'll be fine,
I am fine. I'm absolutely fine.

543
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,439
Yes, you're great. Now,
I'll be next door if you need me.

544
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,280
Why would I need you?
No reason at all.

545
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,759
The photographs are perfectly safe.
In the hands of a fugitive sex worker?

546
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,799
She's not interested in blackmail.

547
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,879
She wants... protection,
for some reason.

548
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,100
I take it you've stood
down the police

549
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,319
investigation into the
shooting at her house?

550
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,559
How can we do anything while she has
the photographs? Our hands are tied.

551
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,919
She'd applaud your choice of words.

552
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,439
You see how this works? The camera-phone
is her get out of jail free card.

553
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,439
You have to leave her alone.
Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.

554
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,839
Though not the way she treats
royalty.

555
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,999
What was that?

556
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,840
Text.
But what was that noise?

557
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,319
Did you know there were
other people after her too

558
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,319
before you sent John and I in there?

559
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,999
CIA trained killers, I think.
Thanks for that.

560
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,679
It's a disgrace, sending your little
brother into danger like that.

561
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,319
Family is all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!

562
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,560
Shut up, Mrs Hudson!
Mycroft!!

563
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,439
Apologies. Thank you.
Though do in fact shut up.

564
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,239
It's a bit rude,
that noise, isn't it?

565
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,279
There's nothing you can do and nothing
she will do, as far as I can see.

566
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,599
I can put maximum
surveillance on her.

567
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,599
Why bother?
You can follow her on Twitter.

568
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,559
I believe her user name is
The Whip Hand.

569
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,000
Most amusing. Excuse me. Hello?

570
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,439
Why does your phone make that noise?

571
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,119
What noise?
That noise, the one it just made.

572
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,119
It's a text alert,
means I've got a text.

573
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,479
Your texts don't usually
make that noise.

574
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,919
Well, somebody got hold of the phone
and apparently as a joke,

575
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,239
personalised their text alert noise.

576
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,960
So every time they text you...

577
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,159
It would seem so.

578
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,319
Could you turn that phone down a
bit? At my time of life it's...

579
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,679
See I'm wondering who could have
got hold of your phone.

580
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,080
It would've been in your coat.
I'll leave you to your deductions.

581
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,079
I'm not stupid, you know.

582
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,999
Where do you get that idea?

583
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,039
Bond Air is go, that's decided.
Check with the Coventry lot.

584
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,279
Talk later.

585
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,159
What else does she have?

586
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,639
Irene Adler. The Americans
wouldn't be interested in her

587
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,319
for a couple of
compromising photographs.

588
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,999
There's more. Much more.

589
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,399
Something big's coming, isn't it?

590
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,719
Irene Adler is no longer
any concern of yours.

591
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,559
From now on,
you will stay out of this.

592
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,879
Will I? Yes, Sherlock.

593
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,400
You will.

594
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,239
Now if you'll excuse me,

595
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,959
I have a long and arduous apology
to make to a very old friend.

596
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,519
Do give her my love.

597
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,479
Lovely, Sherlock. That was lovely.

598
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,799
Marvellous. Yes, very good.

599
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,760
I wish you could have worn
the antlers.

600
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:21,239
Some things are best left to the
imagination, Mrs Hudson. Mrs H?

601
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,439
No thank you, Sarah. No, no,
he's not good with names.

602
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,640
No, I can get this.

603
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:28,559
Sarah was the doctor, then there was
the one with the spots,

604
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,999
then the one with the nose and then,
who was after the boring teacher?

605
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,199
Nobody. Jeanette! Process
of elimination. Dear Lord.

606
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,199
Hello, everyone.
It said on the door to come up.

607
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,239
Hello, Molly. Hello, Molly!

608
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,839
Everybody saying hello to each
other, how wonderful!

609
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,279
Let me, er... Holy Mary!

610
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,879
So we're having Christmas drinkies?
No stopping them, apparently.

611
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,799
It's the one day of the year where
the boys have to be nice to me,

612
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,919
so it's almost worth it.

613
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,460
John? The counter on
your blog still says 1895.

614
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,999
No, Christmas is cancelled

615
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,319
And you've got a photograph of me
wearing that hat! People like it.

616
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,799
No, they don't. What people?
How's the hip?

617
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,079
It's atrocious,
but thanks for asking.

618
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,919
I've seen much worse,
but then I do post-mortems.

619
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,199
God, sorry.
Don't make jokes, Molly.

620
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,439
No, sorry. Here you are. Thank you.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

621
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,319
I thought you were in Dorset
for Christmas?

622
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,719
First thing in the morning, me and
the wife, back together, sorted.

623
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,639
No, she's sleeping with a PE
teacher.

624
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,039
And John, I hear you're off
to your sister's? Yeah.

625
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,279
Sherlock was complaining. Saying.

626
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,159
First time ever, she's cleaned up
her act, off the booze.

627
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,599
Nope. Shut up, Sherlock!

628
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,719
I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly.
You're serious about him. Sorry, what?

629
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,679
You're seeing him tonight, giving
him a gift. Take a day off.

630
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,620
Shut up. Have a drink.
Surely you see the

631
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:53,559
perfectly wrapped
present in the bag.

632
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,279
The others are slapdash.
It's for someone special.

633
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,439
The shade of red echoes her lipstick
... an unconscious association,

634
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,740
or one she's deliberately
trying to encourage.

635
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:05,039
Either way, Miss Hooper
has love on her mind.

636
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,839
That she's serious about him is clear
from the fact she's giving him a gift.

637
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,119
It suggests long-term hopes.

638
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,519
That she's seeing him tonight is
evident from her make-up and clothes.

639
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,680
Obviously trying to compensate for
the size of her mouth and breasts.

640
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,639
You always say such horrible things.

641
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,559
Every time. Always.

642
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,080
Always.

643
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,360
I am sorry. Forgive me.

644
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,519
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

645
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,799
No!
That wasn't, I didn't...

646
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,359
No, it was me. My God, really?

647
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,959
What? My phone.

648
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,759
Fifty seven? Sorry, what?

649
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,719
Fifty seven of those texts,
the ones I've heard.

650
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,680
Thrilling that you've been counting.

651
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,319
Excuse me.

652
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,999
What's up, Sherlock?

653
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I said excuse me.
Do you ever reply?

654
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,519
Dear Lord, we're not going to have
Christmas phone calls now, are we?

655
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,719
Have they passed a new law?

656
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,559
I think you're going to find
Irene Adler tonight.

657
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,519
We already know where she is.

658
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,239
As you were kind enough to point
out, it hardly matters.

659
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,480
No, I mean you're going
to find her dead.

660
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,840
You OK? Yes.

661
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,399
The only one who fitted
the description.

662
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,519
Had her brought here,
your home from home.

663
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,439
You didn't need to come in, Molly.

664
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,759
It's OK, everyone else
is busy with... Christmas.

665
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,840
The face is a bit sort of bashed-up,
so it might be a bit difficult.

666
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,960
That's her, isn't it?
Show me the rest of her.

667
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,319
That's her.

668
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,359
Thank you, Miss Hooper.

669
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,200
Who is she? How did Sherlock
recognise her from... not her face?

670
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,800
Just the one. Why?
Merry Christmas.

671
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,600
Smoking indoors, isn't there one
of those... one of those law things?

672
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,399
We're in a morgue.

673
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,480
There's only
so much damage you can do.

674
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,679
How did you know she was dead?

675
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,319
She had an item in her possession,
one she said her life depended on.

676
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,120
She chose to give it up.
Where is this item now?

677
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,799
Look at them.

678
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,320
They all care so much.

679
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,759
Do you ever wonder
if there's something wrong with us?

680
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,639
All lives end,
all hearts are broken.

681
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,200
Caring is not an advantage,
Sherlock.

682
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,879
This is low tar.

683
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,199
Well, you barely knew her.

684
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,560
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.

685
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,680
And a happy new year.

686
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,279
He's on his way.
Have you found anything?

687
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,799
No. Did he take the cigarette?
Yes. Shit!

688
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,039
He's coming, ten minutes.
There's nothing in the bedroom.

689
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,679
It looks like he's clean,
we've tried all the usual places.

690
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,999
Are you sure tonight's
a danger night?

691
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,639
No, but then I never am.
You have to stay with him, John.

692
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,319
I've got plans.

693
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,640
No.

694
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,040
Mycroft?

695
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,079
I am really sorry.

696
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,519
You know my friends are
so wrong about you?

697
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,639
You're a great boyfriend.
OK, that's good.

698
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,839
I always thought I was great.
Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.

699
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,479
Jeanette, please.

700
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,999
No, I mean it. It's heart-warming.
You'll do anything for him.

701
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,679
And he can't even tell
your girlfriends apart!

702
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,759
I'll do anything for you, just tell
me what it is I'm not doing.

703
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,399
Don't make me compete
with Sherlock Holmes!

704
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,759
I'll walk your dog. There, I've said
it, I'll even walk your dog.

705
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,959
I don't have a dog!
No, because that was the last one.

706
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,879
OK. Jesus! I'll call you. No! OK.

707
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,400
That really wasn't very good,
was it?

708
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,720
Hi.

709
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,560
You OK?

710
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,760
I hope you didn't mess up
my sock index this time!

711
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,959
Lovely tune, Sherlock,
haven't heard that one before.

712
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,519
Composing?

713
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,760
Helps me to think.

714
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,519
What are you thinking about?

715
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,559
The count on your blog
is still stuck at 1895.

716
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,799
Yes.
Faulty, can't seem to fix it.

717
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,559
Faulty, or you've been hacked
and it's a message.

718
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,239
Just faulty.

719
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,000
Right.

720
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,319
Right.

721
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,560
Well, I'm going out for a bit.

722
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,359
Listen, has he ever had any
kind of girlfriend,

723
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,479
boyfriend, a relationship, ever?

724
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,119
I don't know.

725
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,479
How can we not know?

726
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,799
He's Sherlock.

727
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,359
How will we ever know what goes
on in that funny old head?

728
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,200
Right. See you.

729
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,240
John? Yeah? Hello?

730
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,439
Hello.
So, any plans for new year tonight?

731
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,840
Nothing fixed.

732
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,439
Nothing I couldn't
heartlessly abandon.

733
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,720
You have any ideas? One.

734
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,199
You know,
Mycroft could just phone me,

735
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,680
if he didn't have this
bloody stupid power complex.

736
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,719
Couldn't we just go to a cafe?

737
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,840
Sherlock doesn't
follow me everywhere.

738
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,480
Through there.

739
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,919
He's on his way.

740
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,800
You were right,
he thinks it's Mycroft.

741
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,240
He's writing sad music.

742
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,439
Doesn't eat, barely talks,

743
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,639
only to correct the television.

744
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,639
I'd say he was heart-broken,
but, well he's Sherlock.

745
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,880
He does all that anyway.

746
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,360
Hello, Dr Watson.

747
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,480
Tell him you're alive.

748
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:32,279
He'd come after me.

749
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,079
I'll come after you if you don't.

750
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,919
I believe you.

751
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,159
You were dead on a slab.

752
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,959
It was definitely you.

753
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,959
DNA tests are only as good
as the records you keep.

754
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,799
And I bet you know the record keeper.
I know what he likes.

755
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,719
And I needed to disappear.

756
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,639
Then how come I can see you
and I don't even want to?

757
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,079
Look, I made a mistake,

758
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,519
I sent something to Sherlock for
safekeeping, now I need it back.

759
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,039
I need your help. No.
It's for his own safety.

760
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,399
So is this.
Tell him you're alive.

761
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,559
I can't. Fine, I'll tell him

762
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,439
and I still won't help you.
What do I say?

763
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,359
What do you normally say?!
You've texted him a lot!

764
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,639
Just the usual stuff.
There is no usual in this case.

765
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,679
"Good morning.
I like your funny hat.

766
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,600
"I'm sad tonight, let's have dinner.

767
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:33,439
" You look sexy on Crimewatch,
let's have dinner.

768
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,599
"I'm not hungry.

769
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,479
"Let's have dinner".

770
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,319
You flirted with Sherlock Holmes?
At him. He never replies.

771
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,679
No, Sherlock always replies
to everything.

772
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,799
He's Mr Punchline.

773
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,519
He will outlive God trying
to have the last word.

774
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,639
Does that make me special?

775
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,599
I don't know, maybe.
Are you jealous?

776
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,319
We're not a couple.
Yes, you are.

777
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,879
There, "I'm not dead."

778
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,119
"Let's have dinner".

779
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,279
Who the hell knows about
Sherlock Holmes? But for the record,

780
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,039
if anyone out there still cares,
I'm not actually gay.

781
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,840
Well, I am. Look at us both.

782
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,120
I don't think so, do you?

783
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,560
Stop it! Stop it!

784
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,800
Sherlock!

785
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,799
Sherlock, Sherlock...
Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson,

786
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,960
it'll do nothing to impede
the flight of a bullet.

787
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,479
What a tender world that would be.

788
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,039
Please, Sherlock...

789
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,399
I believe that you have
something that we want, Mr Holmes.

790
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,480
Then why don't you ask for it?

791
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,759
I've been asking this one,
she doesn't seem to know anything.

792
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,640
But you know what I'm asking for,
don't you, Mr Holmes?

793
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,000
I believe I do.

794
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,960
Please, help.

795
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,599
First get rid of your boys.

796
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,519
Why? I dislike being outnumbered,

797
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,840
it makes for too much
stupid in the room.

798
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,479
You two, go to the car.
Then get into the car and drive away.

799
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,880
Don't try to trick me,
you know who I am, it doesn't work.

800
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,959
Next, you can stop pointing
that gun at me.

801
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,799
So you can point a gun at me?

802
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,919
I'm unarmed.

803
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,280
Mind if I check? I insist.

804
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,200
Moron.

805
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,000
Thank you. You're all right now,
you're all right.

806
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,720
Jeez, what the
hell is happening?

807
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:10,679
Mrs Hudson has been
attacked by an American,

808
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,839
I'm restoring balance
to the universe.

809
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,399
Mrs Hudson, my God,
are you all right?

810
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,479
Jesus, what have they done to you?

811
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,239
I'm just being so silly.

812
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,879
Take her downstairs
and look after her.

813
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,239
It's all right,
I'll have a look at that.

814
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,560
I'm fine, I'm fine.

815
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,800
Are you going to tell me
what's going on? I expect so, now go.

816
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,599
Lestrade?

817
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,439
We've had a break-in
at Baker Street.

818
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,879
Send your least irritating officers
and an ambulance.

819
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,999
No, no, no, we're fine.

820
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,320
No, it's the burglar, he's
got himself rather badly injured.

821
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,000
A few broken ribs, fractured
skull, suspected punctured lung...

822
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,520
He fell out of a window.

823
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,760
It stings.

824
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,359
That was right on my bins.

825
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,079
And exactly how many times
did he fall out the window?

826
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,479
It's all a bit of a blur,
Detective Inspector.

827
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,200
I lost count.

828
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,679
She'll have to sleep
upstairs in our flat tonight,

829
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,080
we need to look after her.

830
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:35,679
No... She's fine.
No, she's not, look at her.

831
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,319
She's got to take some time
away from Baker Street.

832
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,039
She can stay with her sister,
doctor's orders.

833
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,479
Don't be absurd.
She's in shock, for God's sake,

834
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,599
and all over some stupid
camera-phone... where is it anyway?

835
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,919
Safest place I know.

836
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,039
You left it in the pocket of your
second best dressing gown, you clot!

837
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,919
I managed to sneak it out when
they thought I was having a cry.

838
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,639
Thank you.

839
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,439
Shame on you, John Watson.

840
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,599
Shame on me?
Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?

841
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,440
England would fall.

842
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,119
Where is it now?

843
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,479
Where no-one will look.

844
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,559
Whatever's on that phone
is more than just pictures.

845
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,200
Yes, it is.

846
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,840
So, she's alive then.

847
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,520
How are we feeling about that?

848
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,999
Happy New Year, John.

849
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,960
Do you think you'll be
seeing her again?

850
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,999
Is that a phone?
It's a camera-phone.

851
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,839
And you're x-raying it?
Yes, I am.

852
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,599
Whose phone is it? A woman's.

853
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,039
Your girlfriend?

854
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,479
She's my girlfriend because
I'm x-raying her possessions?

855
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,600
Well, we all do silly things! Yes...

856
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,199
they do, don't they?

857
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,320
Very silly.

858
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,519
She sent this to my address.

859
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,920
She loves to play games. She does?

860
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,839
Hey, Sherlock...

861
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,519
We have a client.

862
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,360
What, in your bedroom?

863
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,919
So, who's after you?

864
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,999
People who want to kill me.
Who's that?

865
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,919
Killers.

866
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,320
It would help if you were
a tiny bit more specific.

867
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:07,100
So you faked your own death
to get ahead of them?

868
01:04:07,101 --> 01:04:08,879
It worked for a while.

869
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,000
Except you let John know
you're alive, therefore me.

870
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:13,119
I knew you'd keep my secret.

871
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,519
You couldn't.

872
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,160
But you did, didn't you?

873
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,119
Where's my camera-phone?

874
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,519
It's not here.

875
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,959
We're not stupid.

876
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,820
What have you done with it?

877
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:25,679
If they've guessed,
they'll be watching you.

878
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,999
Then they'll know I took
a safety deposit box

879
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,079
at a bank on the Strand
a few months ago.

880
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,159
I need it.

881
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,520
Well, we can't just go
and get it, can we?

882
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,919
Molly Hooper, she could collect it,
take it to Barts.

883
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,119
Then one of your homeless network could
bring it here, leave it in the cafe,

884
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,679
one of the boys downstairs
could bring it up the back.

885
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,239
Very good, John, excellent plan,
full of intelligent precautions.

886
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,120
Thank you.
So, why don't I phone...

887
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,759
So, what do you keep on here?

888
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,559
In general, I mean?

889
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,679
Pictures, information,
anything I might find useful.

890
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,960
For blackmail? For protection.

891
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,039
I make my way in the world,
I misbehave.

892
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,439
I like to know people will be on my
side exactly when I need them to be.

893
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,399
So how do you acquire this information?
I told you I misbehave.

894
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,840
But you've acquired something
more danger than protection.

895
01:05:18,841 --> 01:05:21,279
Do you know what it is? Yes...

896
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,919
but I don't understand it.

897
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,640
I assumed. Show me.

898
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,160
The passcode.

899
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,759
It's not working.

900
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,199
No, because it's
a duplicate I had made

901
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,639
into which you just
entered the numbers 1058.

902
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,800
I assumed you'd choose something more
specific than that, but thanks, anyway.

903
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,199
I told you that
camera-phone was my life.

904
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,879
I know when it's in my hand.

905
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,239
You're rather good.

906
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,240
You're not so bad.

907
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,480
Hamish.

908
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:22,760
John Hamish Watson, just
if you were looking for baby names.

909
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,640
There was a man, an MOD official
and I knew what he liked.

910
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,399
One of the things
he liked was showing off.

911
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,919
He told me this email was going
to save the world.

912
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,799
He didn't know but I photographed it
... he was a bit tied up at the time.

913
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,919
It's a bit small on that screen,
can you read it?

914
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,199
Yes. Code, obviously.

915
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,359
I had one of the country's
best cryptographers take a look,

916
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,159
though he was mostly upside down,
as I recall.

917
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,320
Couldn't figure it out.

918
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,720
What can you do, Mr Holmes?

919
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:58,920
Go on, impress a girl.

920
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,639
There's a margin for error,

921
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,700
but I'm pretty sure
there's a 747 leaving

922
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,759
Heathrow tomorrow at
6.30 for Baltimore.

923
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,559
Apparently it's going to
save the world, I'm not sure how,

924
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,960
but give me a moment, I've only
been on the case eight seconds.

925
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,439
Come on, it's not code,
these are seats on a jet.

926
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,759
Look, no 'I' because
it can be mistaken for one.

927
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,519
No letters past 'K'
the width of the plane is the limit.

928
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,799
The numbers always appear
not in sequence,

929
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,900
but the letters have
little runs of sequence

930
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:42,999
families and couples
sitting together.

931
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,180
Only a Jumbo's wide enough
for a letter 'K' or

932
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:47,359
rows past 55, so there's
always an upstairs.

933
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,639
A row 13 eliminates
superstitious airlines.

934
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,879
The style of the flight number,
'007', eliminates a few more.

935
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,719
Assuming a British point of origin
because of the original source,

936
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,959
and assuming the crisis is imminent,
the only flight that matches

937
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,500
all the criteria and
departs within the week is

938
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:05,040
the 6.30 to Baltimore
tomorrow from Heathrow.

939
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,119
Please don't feel obliged to tell me
that was amazing,

940
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,719
John's expressed that in every
possible variant available in English.

941
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,199
I would have you right here,
on this desk,

942
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,400
until you begged for mercy twice.

943
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,160
John, can you check those
flight schedules, see if I'm right?

944
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,079
I'm on it, yeah.

945
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,279
I've never begged for mercy
in my life.

946
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,919
Twice.

947
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,119
Yeah, you're right,
flight double 'o' seven.

948
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,519
What did you say? You're right.

949
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,559
No, what did you say after that?

950
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,279
Double 'o' seven,
flight double 'o' seven.

951
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,240
Double 'o' seven,
double 'o' seven...

952
01:08:45,241 --> 01:08:47,079
Something, double 'o' seven...

953
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,640
What?

954
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,039
Double 'o' seven,
double 'o' seven, what?

955
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,680
What, something, what?!

956
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,519
Bond Air is go.

957
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,920
Bond Air is go.

958
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,800
Bond Air is go.

959
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,199
'Bond Air is go, that's decided.

960
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,320
'Check with the Coventry lot.'

961
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,160
Coventry. I've never been.

962
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,719
Is it nice?

963
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,479
Where's John?

964
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,799
He went out, a couple of hours ago.

965
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,839
I was just talking to him.

966
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,519
He said you do that.

967
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,240
What's Coventry got to do
with anything?

968
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,879
It's a story, probably not true

969
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,220
in the Second World
War, the Allies knew

970
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:57,559
Coventry was going to
get bombed, because

971
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,159
they'd broken the German code, but
didn't want the Germans to know that,

972
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,800
so they let it happen anyway.
Have you ever had anyone?

973
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,199
I'm sorry?

974
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,039
And when I say had,
I'm being indelicate.

975
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,520
I don't understand.
I'll be delicate then.

976
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,839
Let's have dinner. Why?

977
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,359
You might be hungry.
I'm not. Good.

978
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:29,199
Why would I... want to have dinner...

979
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,199
if I wasn't hungry?

980
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,239
Mr Holmes,
if it was the end of the world,

981
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,560
if this was the very last night...

982
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,439
would you have dinner with me?

983
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,799
Sherlock?

984
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,879
Too late.

985
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,479
That's not the end of the world,
that's Mrs Hudson.

986
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,399
Sherlock, this man was at the door,
is the bell still not working?

987
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,759
He shot it.

988
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,919
Have you come to take me away again?

989
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,759
Yes, Mr Holmes. Well, I decline.

990
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,160
I don't think you do.

991
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,879
There's going to be a bomb
on a passenger jet.

992
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,319
The British and Americans
know about it,

993
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,040
but rather than expose
their source they're going

994
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:40,759
to let it happen
the plane will blow up.

995
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,359
Coventry all over again.

996
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,440
The wheel turns,
nothing is ever new.

997
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,439
Well, you're looking all better.

998
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,279
How you feeling?

999
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,679
Like putting a bullet in your brain,
sir.

1000
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,719
They'd pin a medal on me if I did...

1001
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,080
sir.

1002
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,279
The Coventry conundrum.

1003
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,560
What do you think of my solution?

1004
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,800
The flight of the dead.

1005
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,279
Plane blows up midair, mission
accomplished for the terrorists,

1006
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,879
hundreds of casualties,
but nobody dies.

1007
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,079
Neat, don't you think?

1008
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,879
You've been stumbling around
the fringes of this one for ages.

1009
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,639
Or were you too bored
to notice the pattern?

1010
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,439
They wouldn't let us see Granddad
when he was dead.

1011
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,359
She's not my real aunt
I know human ash.

1012
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,919
We ran a similar project with
the Germans a while back,

1013
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,560
though I believe one of our
passengers didn't make the flight.

1014
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,079
But that's the deceased for you...

1015
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,439
late, in every sense of the word.

1016
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,079
How is the plane going to fly?

1017
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,119
Of course, unmanned aircraft,
hardly new.

1018
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,839
It doesn't fly.

1019
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,439
It will never fly.

1020
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,599
This entire project is cancelled.

1021
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,799
The terrorist cells have been
informed we know about the bomb.

1022
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,520
We can't fool them now.

1023
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,039
We've lost everything.

1024
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,759
One fragment of one email,

1025
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:31,160
and months and years of planning
finished.

1026
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,639
Your MOD man.
That's all it takes.

1027
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,879
One lonely, naive man,
desperate to show off,

1028
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,560
and a woman clever enough
to make him feel special.

1029
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,919
You should screen your
defence people more carefully.

1030
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,080
I'm not talking about the MOD man,
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

1031
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,480
The damsel in distress.

1032
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,079
In the end,
are you really so obvious?

1033
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,960
Because this was textbook.

1034
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,760
The promise of love, the pain
of loss, the joy of redemption.

1035
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,680
Then give him a puzzle
and watch him dance.

1036
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,559
Don't be absurd!

1037
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,999
Absurd?

1038
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,679
How quickly did you decipher
that email for her?

1039
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,399
Was it the full minute?

1040
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,199
Or were you really eager to impress?

1041
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,720
I think it was less than
five seconds.

1042
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,640
I drove you into her path.

1043
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,199
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1044
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,479
Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk.

1045
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,639
So do I, there are a number of
aspects I'm still not clear on.

1046
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,400
Not you, Junior, you're done now.

1047
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,879
There's more, loads more.

1048
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,519
On this phone I've got secrets,
pictures

1049
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,399
and scandals that could
topple your whole world.

1050
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,879
You have no idea how much havoc I can
cause and exactly one way to stop me.

1051
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,959
Unless you want to tell
your masters

1052
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,240
that your biggest security leak
is your own little brother.

1053
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,879
We have people
who can get into this.

1054
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,719
I tested that theory for you.

1055
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,479
I let Sherlock Holmes
try it for six months.

1056
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,039
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you
found when you x-rayed my phone.

1057
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,879
Four additional units
wired inside the casing,

1058
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,799
I suspect containing acid
or a small explosive.

1059
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,399
Any attempt to open it
will burn the hard drive.

1060
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,519
Explosive.

1061
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,519
It's more me.

1062
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,079
Some data is always recoverable.

1063
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,360
Take that risk.

1064
01:17:39,361 --> 01:17:41,319
You have a passcode to open this.

1065
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,159
I deeply regret to say, we have
people who can extract it from you.

1066
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,279
Sherlock? There will be
two passcodes

1067
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,479
one to open the phone,
one to burn the drive.

1068
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,359
Even under duress, you can't know
which one she's given

1069
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,519
and there would be no second
attempt. He's good, isn't he?

1070
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,199
I should have him on a leash.

1071
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,399
In fact, I might.

1072
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,039
We destroy this, then.
No-one has the information.

1073
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,559
Fine, good idea.

1074
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,319
Unless there are lives
of British citizens

1075
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,519
depending on the information
you burn.

1076
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,439
Are there?
Telling you would be playing fair.

1077
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,640
I'm not playing any more.

1078
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,679
A list of my requests,

1079
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,560
and some ideas about my protection
once they're granted.

1080
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,680
I'd say it wouldn't blow
much of a hole in the

1081
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:32,080
wealth of a nation, but
then I'd be lying.

1082
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,079
I imagine you'd like to sleep on it.
Thank you, yes.

1083
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,480
Too bad.

1084
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,880
Off you pop and talk to people.

1085
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,320
You've been very... thorough.

1086
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,279
I wish our lot were
half as good as you.

1087
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,160
I can't take all the credit,
I had a bit of help.

1088
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,799
Jim Moriarty sends his love.

1089
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,559
Yes, he's been in touch.

1090
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,199
Seems desperate for my attention,

1091
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,479
which I'm sure can be arranged.

1092
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,839
I had all this stuff and
never knew what to do with it.

1093
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,959
Thank God for
the consultant criminal.

1094
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,839
Gave me a lot of advice about how
to play the Holmes boys.

1095
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,839
Do you know what he calls you?

1096
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,079
The Ice Man...

1097
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,520
and the Virgin.

1098
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,119
Didn't even ask for anything,
he just likes to cause trouble

1099
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,519
that's my kind of man.

1100
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,359
And here you are,

1101
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:38,559
the dominatrix who brought
a nation to its knees.

1102
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,679
Nicely played.

1103
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,240
No.

1104
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,720
Sorry?

1105
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,519
I said no.

1106
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,039
Very, very close, but no.

1107
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,879
You got carried away.

1108
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,559
The game was too elaborate,
you were enjoying yourself too much.

1109
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,399
There's no such thing as too much.

1110
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,799
Enjoying the thrill
of the chase is fine.

1111
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,079
Craving the distraction of the game,
I sympathise, but sentiment?

1112
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,799
Sentiment is a chemical defect
found in the losing side.

1113
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,559
Sentiment?
What are you talking about?

1114
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,040
You.

1115
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,799
Dear God.

1116
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,200
Look at the poor man.

1117
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,279
You don't actually think
I was interested in you?

1118
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,999
Why?

1119
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,359
Because you're the great
Sherlock Holmes,

1120
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,559
the clever detective
in the funny hat?

1121
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,000
No.

1122
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,680
Because I took your pulse.

1123
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,239
Elevated.

1124
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,160
Your pupils dilated.

1125
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,039
I imagine John Watson thinks
love's a mystery to me,

1126
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:02,919
but the chemistry is incredibly
simple and very destructive.

1127
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,240
When we first met, you
told me that disguise

1128
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:07,559
is always a self-portrait
- How true of you.

1129
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,998
The combination to your safe,
your measurements

1130
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,960
but this,
this is far more intimate,

1131
01:21:11,961 --> 01:21:15,879
this is your heart and you should
never let it rule your head.

1132
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,319
You could have chosen any number
and walked out with everything.

1133
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,079
But you just couldn't resist it,
could you?

1134
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:27,039
I've always assumed that love
is a dangerous disadvantage.

1135
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,000
Thank you for the final proof.

1136
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,840
Everything I said, it's not real.

1137
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,479
I was just playing the game.

1138
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,079
I know.

1139
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,040
And this is just losing.

1140
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,039
There you are, Brother,

1141
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,399
hope the contents make up for any
inconvenience caused tonight.

1142
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,519
I'm certain they will.
If you're feeling kind, lock her up,

1143
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,839
let her go and I doubt
she'll survive long.

1144
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,600
Are you expecting me to beg?
Yes.

1145
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,640
Please.

1146
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,520
You're right.

1147
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,760
I won't even last six months.

1148
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,240
Sorry about dinner.

1149
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,639
You don't smoke.

1150
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,360
I also don't frequent cafes.

1151
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,719
This the file on Irene Adler?

1152
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,639
Closed forever.

1153
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,239
I am about to go
and inform my brother

1154
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,159
or, if you prefer, you are

1155
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:13,399
that she somehow got herself into a
witness protection scheme in America.

1156
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,239
New name, new identity.

1157
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,119
She will survive and thrive...

1158
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,039
but he will never see her again.

1159
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,399
Why would he care?

1160
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,799
He despised her at the end.

1161
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,839
Won't even mention her by name,
just 'The Woman'.

1162
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,400
Is that loathing or a salute?

1163
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,039
One of a kind,
the one woman who matters.

1164
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,399
He's not like that.

1165
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,159
He doesn't feel things that way,
I don't think.

1166
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,799
My brother has the brain
of a scientist or a philosopher,

1167
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,840
yet he elects to be a detective.

1168
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,279
What might we deduce
about his heart?

1169
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,639
I don't know.

1170
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,879
Neither do I.

1171
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,920
But, initially,
he wanted to be a pirate.

1172
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,520
He'll be OK with this

1173
01:24:01,521 --> 01:24:03,160
witness protection, never
seeing her again

1174
01:24:03,161 --> 01:24:04,799
he'll be fine.

1175
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,079
I agree.

1176
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,440
That's why I decided
to tell him that.

1177
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,320
Instead of what?

1178
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,960
She's dead.

1179
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,559
She was captured by a terrorist
cell in Karachi two months ago

1180
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,040
and beheaded.

1181
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,039
It was definitely her?

1182
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,599
She's done this before.

1183
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,680
I was thorough this time.

1184
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,879
It would take
Sherlock Holmes to fool me,

1185
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,120
and I don't think
he was on hand, do you?

1186
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,000
So...

1187
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,120
What shall we tell Sherlock?

1188
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,039
Clearly you've got news.

1189
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,519
If it's about the Leeds triple
murder, it was the gardener.

1190
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,039
Did nobody notice the earring? Hi.

1191
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,960
No, it's, um... it's about
Irene Adler.

1192
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,479
Well?

1193
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,799
Something happened?
Has she come back?

1194
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,319
No, she's... I bumped into Mycroft
downstairs, he had to take a call.

1195
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,079
Is she back in London?

1196
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,319
No...

1197
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,840
She's...

1198
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,399
She's in America.
America?

1199
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,799
Got herself on a witness protection
scheme, apparently.

1200
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,679
Don't know how she swung it,
but... well, you know.

1201
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,039
I know what? You won't be able
to see her again.

1202
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,839
Why would I want to see her again?
Didn't say you did.

1203
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,999
Is that her file? Yes, I was going
to take it back to Mycroft.

1204
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,560
Do you want to... No.

1205
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,919
Listen, actually...

1206
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,080
But I will have
the camera-phone though.

1207
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,919
There's nothing on it, it's been
stripped... I know, but I...

1208
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,439
I'll still have it.

1209
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,600
I've got to give this back to
Mycroft, you can't keep it.

1210
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:20,079
Sherlock, I have to give this to
Mycroft, it's the government's now...

1211
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,000
Please.

1212
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,400
Thank you.

1213
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,560
Well, I'd better take this back.
Yes.

1214
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:53,639
Did she ever text you again,
after all that?

1215
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,159
Once, a few months ago.

1216
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,439
What did she say?

1217
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,200
"Goodbye, Mr Holmes."

1218
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,159
When I say run...

1219
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,680
run!

1220
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,040
The Woman.

1221
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,880
THE Woman.

1222
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,880
