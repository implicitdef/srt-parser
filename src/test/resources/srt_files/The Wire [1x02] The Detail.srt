1
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:13,705
That's the witness all right,
the one from the Barksdale case.

2
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,543
Gant, William. 41 years.

3
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:21,113
Single headshot, close range.
Bullet pancaked on the inner skull.

4
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,289
-Ain't necessarily what it looks like.
-No?

5
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,590
A man's walking down a street
in West Baltimore.

6
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,961
That'll catch you a bullet
for a half-dozen reasons.

7
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,762
-Yeah, that it will.
-You run him for a sheet?

8
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,734
Yeah, a couple of disorderlies is all.

9
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,829
Guy works maintenance
down at Poe Homes.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,135
Lives alone, no wife, no kids.

11
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:45,767
Only time his name pops up
on the courthouse computer...

12
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,903
is for being a state witness in Barlow's case.

13
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,539
Otherwise,
I don't even make that connection.

14
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,717
I mean, you've got to admit...

15
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,053
it don't make sense to ace this motherfucker
after he done testified.

16
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,557
Sends a hell of a message though.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,528
He's one hardheaded fuck in the Terrace
you can't run off or buy out, right?

18
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,760
If your audience is the high-rise projects,
a move like this cuts right through the shit.

19
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,301
What are you gonna tell the major?

20
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,099
That I caught a stone fucking whodunit.

21
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,039
-Don't soft-sell the witness angle.
-Come on.

22
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,339
Why get the bosses riled
before we know for sure?

23
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:21,743
If I start talking shit
that a witness got killed--

24
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,440
-Bunk, tell him.
-Why?

25
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,312
Just cover yourself on this.

26
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,910
Jimmy, you ain't gonna do what I think?

27
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,757
Listen to me.

28
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,159
This shit is gonna jump up
and bite you in your ass.

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,991
Just cover yourself.

30
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,767
-What the hell was that about?
-Nothing.

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,234
Morning.

32
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,919
Jesus Christ.

33
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,566
Goddamn.

34
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,564
Who do you got to fuck in this town
to get a real office?

35
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:40,473
At least that works.

36
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,686
It was for McNulty.

37
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,560
-I shouldn't be here.
-Then you shouldn't.

38
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,156
They killed a fucking witness
out of your court.

39
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,964
Yeah, you told me. You did your civic duty.

40
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,404
Under the power vested in me
by the circuit court for Baltimore city...

41
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,941
I absolve you of all your sins,
Detective McNulty.

42
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,840
You are my sin, you know that?

43
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,413
For talking to you,
my major is ready to cut my throat.

44
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:18,540
Jimmy, you knew I was gonna
make that call. Admit it.

45
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,587
I didn't think you would straight-up
hang me out on the line in a shitstorm.

46
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,118
Look, it's not like it was
when I was a prosecutor.

47
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,285
-I'm a judge now, the rules are different.
-You missed a spot.

48
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,363
Yeah, what's done is done.

49
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,933
Question is,
what do you want me to do now?

50
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:38,130
I think you can leverage the Deputy Ops
with a phone call.

51
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,467
-He's already detailed people.
-Some detail.

52
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,838
Asshole lieutenant thinks
he can buy-bust his way to Avon Barksdale.

53
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,342
You want leverage?

54
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:48,140
We give the dead-witness angle
to the newspapers.

55
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,441
Stir some real shit.

56
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,880
No, that tips Barksdale
that someone's working him.

57
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,214
-We don't want to go public.
-No?

58
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,878
Just put it to the Deputy Ops...

59
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,115
you lost a witness
who testified in your court.

60
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,022
That forces the department
to commit to the investigation.

61
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,858
And when you call Burrell this time,
will you forget my fucking name?

62
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,103
-You missed a spot.
-Why don't you fucking do it?

63
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,505
Seniority.

64
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,619
-You found us.
-Wasn't easy.

65
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,930
-You asked for these guys?
-I asked for more manpower.

66
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,566
Have a seat.

67
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,103
What the fuck....

68
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,977
Sir, l--

69
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,517
He was showing me
the trigger pull on his Glock.

70
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:04,146
-And he was just--
-Detective?

71
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,749
Officer Pryzbylewski shot the wall,
Lieutenant.

72
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:09,751
Why?

73
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,592
Why did you shoot the wall,
Officer Pryzbylewski?

74
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,134
I was just showing Carv
how my trigger pull is light, you know.

75
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:20,065
-I got it so it's real light.
-He took the clip out, boss.

76
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,063
But not the one in the chamber.

77
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:26,338
No, I forgot the one in the chamber, and....

78
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,176
Shit, I'm sorry, lieutenant.

79
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,118
-You want him to write on it?
-Write on what?

80
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,350
You let one go, you got to write.
You got to justify the use of deadly force.

81
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,989
Against a plaster wall.

82
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,962
It's an accident, okay?
Give me a fucking break already.

83
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,057
-Your name is what?
-Pryzbylewski.

84
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,434
From Auto Unit, right? Cantrell sent you.

85
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,473
Not exactly.

86
00:07:57,576 --> 00:08:01,910
Lt. Cantrell sent me
to Casualty Section a couple months back.

87
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,912
And I asked out of Casualty.

88
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,545
You came here from Casualty Section?

89
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,054
Man, these shits is right, yo.

90
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,530
-It's good with the hot sauce, too.
-Most definite.

91
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:27,603
-Dee, want some nuggets?
-No, go ahead, man.

92
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,766
Man, whoever invented these,
he off the hook.

93
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:31,934
Word!

94
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,914
Motherfucker got the bone
all the way out the damn chicken.

95
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,916
Till he came along,
niggas be chewing on drumsticks and shit...

96
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,986
getting their fingers all greasy.

97
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,849
He said "Later" to the bone.

98
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,018
Nugget that meat up
and make some real money.

99
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,457
-You think the man got paid?
-Who?

100
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,723
-Man who invented these.
-Shit, he richer than a motherfucker.

101
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,492
Why? You think he get a percentage?

102
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,294
Why not?

103
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,563
Nigga, please, the man
who invented them things...

104
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,106
just some sad-ass down
at the basement of McDonald's...

105
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
thinking up some shit
to make money for the real players.

106
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,243
-No man, that ain't right.
-Fuck right.

107
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,778
It ain't about right, it's about money.

108
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,373
You think Ronald McDonald
gonna go down that basement...

109
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:15,112
and say, "Mr. Nugget, you the bomb.

110
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,882
"We selling chicken faster
than you can tear the bone out.

111
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,824
"So, I'm gonna write my clowny-ass name
on this fat-ass check for you."

112
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,619
Shit.

113
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,358
The nigger who invented them things...

114
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,626
still working in the basement
for regular wage...

115
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,067
thinking of some shit
to make the fries taste better.

116
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,565
Believe.

117
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:40,037
He still had the idea, though.

118
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,108
Who?

119
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,314
Polk and Pat Mahone.
A couple of drunks from Property.

120
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,186
-I don't know them.
-Why would you?

121
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,760
They haven't made a case in 10 years.

122
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,058
Also got handed some kid
named Prezbelowski or Prezbelewski--

123
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:02,258
-Pryzbylewski, him, I know.
-Yeah?

124
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:06,160
-Why was he in Casualty Section?
-He shot up his own car.

125
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,603
-You remember?
-He did what?

126
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,143
He fired two clips into an unmarked car,
somewhere out in West Baltimore.

127
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:16,146
Called in a Signal 13 on the radio,
like he was under fire from a sniper.

128
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,079
You didn't hear about that?

129
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:21,744
He stuck to his story for half a day,
until Ballistics matched the bullet...

130
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,253
to his off-duty weapon.

131
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:26,119
-We almost indicted him for false report.
-Why didn't you?

132
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,456
He's got some kind of suction
with the Mayor's office. I'm not sure.

133
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,655
My point is, I can't build much
with the garbage they sent me.

134
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,859
So, go to the deputy, right?
You've got his ear on this.

135
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,095
Why not?

136
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,402
I ask the deputy for manpower.

137
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,965
He then tells Property to send me two men,
and Special to send two more.

138
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,339
And those shift lieutenants...

139
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,538
they know it's a chance
to dump their deadwood.

140
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,911
The deputy, he knows this, too.

141
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,746
He could have offered
to let me pick but he didn't.

142
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,412
-He sent me a message on this.
-And the message is?

143
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,717
Don't dig in, don't get fancy.

144
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,024
Put a quick charge on this Barksdale
and then get out.

145
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:05,221
If he sends me good police,
I might do good police work.

146
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:10,357
-But if the state's attorney's office were to--
-No, no.

147
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,108
Rhonda, darling...

148
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:28,584
it's bad protocol for me to ask for help
and then trash the help I'm given.

149
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,587
-You, on the other hand--
-No way.

150
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,520
My office doesn't play that way.

151
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,218
You people staff your cases,
you bring us casework.

152
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,228
I cross that line, I only piss everyone off.

153
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,500
Best I can do is tell my unit chief
that you drew shit.

154
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,899
He wants to take it upstairs...

155
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,164
call the deputy for operations,
that's his choice.

156
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:49,638
-That won't happen.
-Probably not.

157
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,711
Make lemonade.

158
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,929
Fuck!

159
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,469
Yo, Kima, where you taking us?

160
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,666
-Get down.
-What?

161
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,836
Jesus. You all ain't got no creep to you.

162
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,238
Pair of goddamn elephants.

163
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,146
A rusted nail just went through my shoe.

164
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,588
I'm gonna need a tetanus
to get behind this bullshit.

165
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,758
-Kima.
-Hand me that bag.

166
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,603
Kima, if you don't mind me asking...

167
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:58,102
when was it that you first figured
you liked women better than men?

168
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,304
I mind you asking.

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,882
Gentlemen, what's going on there, guys?

170
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,480
-Testers, man, already out.
-No.

171
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,221
I'm not in need of your services, bro.
I'm offering my services to y'all.

172
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,694
What you got in the bag, man?

173
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,927
One thing a gentleman of color like better
than a new pair of downtown shoes...

174
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,003
is a downtown brim, right?

175
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,228
What's with the hats?

176
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,610
-Five-o!
-Five-o!

177
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,546
Shut it down!

178
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,484
Clean?

179
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:53,216
You ain't gonna put that one on me.
He a witness.

180
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,193
You picked that shit up off the ground,
so don't be trying to put shit on me.

181
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,662
Is that what you think I'm about?

182
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,863
Boy thinks I'm gonna dirty him.

183
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,002
Like y'all won't do it.

184
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:08,095
You Western knockos come here,
picking shit up off the ground...

185
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,174
putting it on whoever you damn well please.

186
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,742
Do I know you?

187
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,446
Let's understand each other.
I'm not Western District.

188
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,278
I'm not a knocko. I don't dirty people...

189
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,511
because I don't care
about a possession charge.

190
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,953
I'm a Murder Police,
I'm here about the bodies.

191
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:29,421
D'Angelo here knows that.
He remembers me from the trial, right?

192
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,464
I'm sitting in back there, behind Stringer,
watching, listening.

193
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,056
Y'all hassling me about that shit?

194
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:38,168
I thought you heard
what the jury had to say.

195
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,261
-Fuck the jury.
-Yeah, fuck the jury.

196
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,839
This is just us talking, right?

197
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,467
Just you, me, my partner and....
What did you say your name was?

198
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,874
I didn't say shit.

199
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:49,845
Just you, me, my partner and Mr. Shit here.

200
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,579
We're just talking
about how things go, right?

201
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,118
We are just sharing our thoughts here.

202
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,486
-Bunk, a vial for your thoughts.
-I'm thinking it's one thing for one of you...

203
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,219
Iittle Terrace niggers
to shoot somebody in the lobby...

204
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,887
of the 221 building, you know?
Who gives a fuck?

205
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,021
-But when you ace a witness...
-A working man.

206
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,293
...who ain't even in the game....

207
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,733
You gonna act like this is news?

208
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,670
I tell you this, I don't know shit about shit,
but I do know this...

209
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,436
anyone who spend time witnessing shit,
you gonna get got.

210
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,645
I know that sounds kind of harsh,
but that's the way things go around here...

211
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,946
officer.

212
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,853
Let's roll.

213
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:47,268
That how you see things, D'Angelo?
Like your friend here?

214
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:56,538
I'm here trying to outfit niggers
with something to rile up some pussy.

215
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,674
You don't want to know,
Bubbles used to get that pussy.

216
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:03,179
I reckon the pussy ain't worth
what it used to be...

217
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,313
if you can do it without
a proper brim, right?

218
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,016
Come on, big man.

219
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,041
-Something's up.
-What?

220
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,448
Don't know.

221
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,546
Yo, Carv. Come here.

222
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,922
Listen, you see Bubbs
put a hat on anybody...

223
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,494
you take some pictures, all right?

224
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,586
-Yeah?
-Especially the red one.

225
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,825
If you see him put that red hat
on anybody's head...

226
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,595
snap your fucking fingers off.

227
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,226
Where you going?

228
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,268
Yo, Carv. Notice that most of the time...

229
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,104
it's like Kima thinks
she's above us or something?

230
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,975
I mean, I don't see any stripes
on her fucking sleeve...

231
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,547
I don't see that.

232
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,074
All I see is some stuck-up dyke bitch...

233
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,584
who ain't been in CID
half the time of you or me...

234
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,917
and she's fucking telling us what to do.

235
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:14,389
It ain't right. You think it's right?

236
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,327
Shut up for just a minute.
I'm trying to concentrate on this shit here.

237
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:25,733
Nice truck.

238
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,204
No? Makes your breath minty fresh.

239
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:37,304
Is you all gonna arrest me?
Then go the fuck ahead and arrest me.

240
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:38,473
If not, shut the fuck up.

241
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,175
-You want to get arrested?
-No.

242
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,083
-Shut the fuck up your own self.
-I'm out of here.

243
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,048
Hey, D'Angelo.
You better bend the fuck over.

244
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,017
Shit.

245
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,990
-You ain't got nothing else to do today?
-No, no, nothing.

246
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,159
Y'all ain't got no charge.

247
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,833
You're getting awfully close, man.
You new on the force or some shit?

248
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,277
All right, Dee.

249
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,576
Move it.

250
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,468
It's Greggs. Get me the lieutenant.

251
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:05,072
Prez? He's no good to anyone, he's a goof.

252
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:08,374
How is he my problem then?
How is he still carrying a gun and badge?

253
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,641
You know Valchek in Southeast?

254
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:12,740
-Yeah.
-Son-in-law.

255
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:16,679
I can't carry him on this.
You know who Special sent me?

256
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:18,619
-Who?
-Polk and Mahoney.

257
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:21,584
Between the two of them
I don't have a designated driver.

258
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,388
I heard you have someone from Pawnshop.

259
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:25,895
Lester Freamon? A cuddly housecat.

260
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:28,826
I don't think he can even find his gun.

261
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:32,467
Look, take Pryzbylewski back.

262
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:36,098
You know I can't. I would, but I can't.
I gave Valchek my word on it, okay?

263
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,733
I can't help it that Prez
is fucking the guy's daughter.

264
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:42,507
-If not for that, he's gone, no question.
-So, you got suction with Valchek?

265
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:45,481
If I cross him,
I'm fucked on the next round of promotions.

266
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:48,883
For Christ's sake,
I'm with you on the short list for major.

267
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:51,785
Valchek has suction
with the First District Democratic Club...

268
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,826
and they got suction with the Mayor,
and I'm the runt without a tit here.

269
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,619
I owe you, okay?

270
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:01,557
-So, give me Sydnor.
-No way.

271
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,065
Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.

272
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:04,999
He's my best man, you can't take him.

273
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:08,163
-I'm taking your worst, remember?
-How about Steinman?

274
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:11,709
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore,
I need a black guy for surveillance.

275
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,277
I need Sydnor.

276
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:17,437
-Jesus, know what Prez did this morning?
-Tell me.

277
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:21,108
He put a bullet through a wall,
dry-firing in the detail office.

278
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,544
Look, no promises.

279
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:25,452
You give me Sydnor,
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.

280
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:28,424
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever. Jesus Christ.

281
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:36,798
How did you handle the judge?

282
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:39,871
I told him we were looking
closely at the situation.

283
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:42,735
I asked him not to say anything publicly.

284
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:46,606
So, then he's not gonna go public, right?

285
00:21:48,413 --> 00:21:49,937
Judge Phelan called this morning...

286
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:53,211
crying about a witness
in his murder trial who was killed.

287
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:55,548
Did the judge say where he heard it?

288
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:58,054
He heard it from our man, McNulty.

289
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:00,187
That's his pipeline on this crap.

290
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:04,695
Pardon my French, but I got no problem
giving that asshole up at this point.

291
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:07,797
-I don't need people I can't trust.
-Yeah, who does?

292
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:11,062
The newspapers get hold of this,
it'll be a complete clusterfuck.

293
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,434
Okay, so the thing to do
is reassure the judge...

294
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,834
keep him off his damn soapbox.

295
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:19,435
An arrest or two would help.

296
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:22,339
What if it's true?

297
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:25,509
What if Barksdale ordered the murder
of a state's witness?

298
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:26,606
Are you serious?

299
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:29,448
Why would anyone do that
after the witness testifies?

300
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:32,489
-It has no effect on the case.
-Payback, plain and simple.

301
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:34,183
Bullshit, plain and simple.

302
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:37,227
Look, I know there could be
two dozen other reasons...

303
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:39,559
for this man to be murdered, but what if--

304
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:43,191
No money for pretrial.
No witness protection program.

305
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:47,203
Look, this is a poor fucking city, gentlemen.

306
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:51,535
The last thing we ever need to do
is to announce we lost a witness.

307
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:54,505
I mean, it's hard enough
pushing felony casework...

308
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:56,080
through that courthouse as it is.

309
00:22:56,181 --> 00:23:00,117
-You got to pull McNulty off this.
-Who caught the murder case?

310
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:03,483
-Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner.
-Then you'd have to pull him, too.

311
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:08,048
No, we pull McNulty up,
the judge will bring the press into this.

312
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,218
I can see that a mile away.

313
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:14,396
No, we're gonna sit tight,
let McNulty take his best shot...

314
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:17,059
and hope like hell he comes up short.

315
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:22,535
How do you wanna handle this?
We got nothing on him.

316
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:24,575
We try to front, he'll see right through us.

317
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,644
He's scared though. Soft.

318
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,239
Go with the deuce?

319
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:31,946
Hold up, hold up.

320
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,651
-He part of my case?
-No, sir.

321
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,519
He's a potential suspect in my murder.

322
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,594
Which might be part of my case.

323
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:53,437
I could use some coffee.
You want some coffee?

324
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:00,609
-I need a word with you.
-We're just about to go--

325
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:01,736
Now.

326
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:07,982
You remember all that bullshit I gave you
about keeping me informed...

327
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:10,646
about nothing happening
that I don't know about?

328
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:12,052
-Lieutenant--
-Wasn't bullshit.

329
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:15,615
My partner caught a murder.
It may have nothing with Barksdale at all.

330
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:17,627
I just came from Deputy Ops' office...

331
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:20,254
where your own major's
telling Burrell to do you.

332
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,731
You hear me? Rawls is giving you up.

333
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:26,099
-What the fuck did I do?
-You can't shut your mouth.

334
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:30,038
You think that downtown judge
is gonna bail your ass out on this?

335
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:33,304
You really think that?
You should have come to me.

336
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:36,208
We bring this business to the deputy first,
we got a shot.

337
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:38,680
But no, you're out there all alone,
jumping bad.

338
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:40,944
-You got the deputy's ear?
-On this case, I do.

339
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:43,850
Then how come they sent
every worthless hump in plainclothes?

340
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:47,186
You ask for men,
they send you drunks and fuck-ups.

341
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:51,292
I want to do this case.

342
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:52,589
So do l.

343
00:24:52,697 --> 00:24:55,325
Then you're gonna get
all the way in, Lieutenant.

344
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:59,836
If I see you get all the way in,
then I know who you are, what you're about.

345
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:03,374
-Who is he?
-D'Angelo Barksdale.

346
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:06,805
-Nephew to the king.
-That's the one that beat the murder?

347
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:08,208
Yeah, him.

348
00:25:08,513 --> 00:25:10,879
What do you have
to connect him to the dead witness?

349
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:13,974
-Not a thing.
-Why did you pick him up?

350
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,317
Press him. See what kind of flex he shows.

351
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:22,855
-She goes in with you.
-We don't need her.

352
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,162
Bunk and me, we got our own rhythm.

353
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:29,029
You want me in, McNulty?
I thought you said you wanted me in.

354
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:35,265
You're along for this interview,
but it's Homicide's play, so let him lead.

355
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:42,639
You might want to run
tag and title on these two trucks.

356
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:46,012
-They scoped us when we jacked the kid.
-Been there.

357
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:48,877
Info's already in the file.

358
00:25:49,387 --> 00:25:52,356
Y'all weren't the only lawmen
down in the Canyon today.

359
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:55,517
-Really, where were you?
-Where was she?

360
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:06,303
I mean, the thing is,
I can't see a reason for that man to be dead.

361
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:09,505
I can't. I mean, hell, you beat us in court.

362
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:11,575
-We don't take it personal.
-Fuck, no.

363
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:15,442
We get paid either way.
And it's not like you did anything real bad...

364
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,048
throwing a couple of hot ones
at Pooh Blanchard.

365
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:20,083
No one's gonna miss that motherfucker.

366
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:22,653
But you know the man
who got killed this time?

367
00:26:22,754 --> 00:26:24,881
You know who that
poor son of a bitch was?

368
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:26,115
A citizen.

369
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:29,455
Worked every goddamn day of his life.
You know that?

370
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:33,255
He would get up every day,
go out and do maintenance work.

371
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:36,162
Then on the weekends,
he was driving a cab out to the airport.

372
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:37,495
Two jobs.

373
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:40,400
And he volunteers what little time
he has left at his church.

374
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:43,303
-Church-going man.
-A bethel man, a deacon.

375
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:47,605
Two jobs and three kids.
Did you know that?

376
00:26:48,012 --> 00:26:50,242
Three kids. Young, too.

377
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:53,577
Five, eight, eleven.

378
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:56,917
Crying their little orphaned asses to sleep...

379
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:59,319
'cause they lost their mama
some years ago...

380
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:01,915
and now they out there on their own.

381
00:27:05,063 --> 00:27:08,328
-He doesn't believe us.
-I know he don't believe it.

382
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:11,593
We've been here two hours,
telling you what's true in the world...

383
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:13,364
and you sit like nothing happened.

384
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:14,563
Where my lawyer at?

385
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:16,833
We called him.
When he comes, we'll let you know.

386
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:18,704
I got nothing to say.

387
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,641
I mean, I'm sorry for the man,
but I ain't got nothing to say.

388
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:25,375
You sorry? You sorry for him?
You fucking killed the man.

389
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,212
-No.
-Yes, you did.

390
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:30,913
We don't think that you shot him,
but if you weren't so busy...

391
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:32,717
Iighting folks up in high-rise lobby...

392
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:35,190
he ain't coming out of the elevator
and see it happen.

393
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:37,090
He don't see anything, he doesn't testify.

394
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,891
He doesn't testify,
those kids still got a daddy to lean on.

395
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:41,727
-Why'd he testify?
-How would we know?

396
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:45,098
-He didn't have to testify.
-No, he didn't, but he did.

397
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:46,966
And you still beat the charge, didn't you?

398
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:49,801
But that wasn't enough.
It's not enough to beat the murder.

399
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:52,536
They gotta send a cold message
to everyone in the Terrace.

400
00:27:52,644 --> 00:27:56,307
Fuck the working man.
Fuck his kids, that shit don't count.

401
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:01,376
See, that's what I don't get
about the drug thing.

402
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:05,013
Why can't you sell the shit
and walk the fuck away?

403
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,689
You know what I mean?
Everything else in this country gets sold...

404
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:10,988
without people shooting each other
behind it.

405
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:13,996
In the Terrace, it's one body after another.

406
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,467
You remember that little boy...

407
00:28:16,668 --> 00:28:20,331
got shot in the barbershop
on West Lombard last summer?

408
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:24,634
One asshole chases another into a house...

409
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:26,334
empties a 9.

410
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:29,345
Bullshit argument over 20 missing gelcaps...

411
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:33,144
and that little kid,
instead of getting his first haircut...

412
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:35,048
he gets one in the eye.

413
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:37,143
You remember that?

414
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:39,324
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.

415
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:40,154
-It's fucked up.
-Yes, it is.

416
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,519
They didn't have to do that.

417
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:46,563
Shoot up a barber shop?

418
00:28:46,931 --> 00:28:49,331
No, they did not have to do that.

419
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,800
That man was just...

420
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:57,603
my thing.

421
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:01,771
My thing, they ain't had....

422
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:06,106
They ain't had to do that.

423
00:29:15,326 --> 00:29:17,191
No mama and no daddy.

424
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:19,627
Lord Jesus!

425
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:27,969
I'll tell you what I think
you should do, D'Angelo...

426
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,404
not because I think you wanted that man
to get shot...

427
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:34,034
or had anything to do with shooting him.

428
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:37,512
But I think you could just sit here...

429
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,841
for a moment or two,
collect your thoughts...

430
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:42,317
you know, get your shit together.

431
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:44,922
And then I think it might be a good thing...

432
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:48,356
for you to write a little letter
to those children...

433
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:51,121
and you let them know you're sorry...

434
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:55,860
that they're not gonna
have anyone left, you know?

435
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,269
I mean, just say something.

436
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,464
Tell them how you personally
think your uncle...

437
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:05,667
maybe he got it wrong this time,
because it's wrong...

438
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:09,406
that they lost their daddy
behind what happened, you know?

439
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:15,684
It might mean something to them to know
that you're feeling for them.

440
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,859
Man, I ain't got nothing to say.

441
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:28,492
Just say what's in your heart.

442
00:30:50,054 --> 00:30:52,522
Church deacon? That was thick.

443
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:54,887
Got good to me, what can I say?

444
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:58,757
It's sad enough with the kids
being orphaned and everything.

445
00:30:59,197 --> 00:31:01,324
Photo was from Bunk's desk.

446
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:05,999
-They're yours?
-Yeah, afraid so.

447
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:09,832
Good thing they look like their mama.

448
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:13,636
Maurice Levy just posted.
He's by the elevators.

449
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:24,116
-The defense never rests.
-Shame on you, McNulty.

450
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:27,089
Dragging me from the Levy family preserve
on a Friday night.

451
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:29,682
-My apologies.
-Yvette made brisket.

452
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:32,262
-Good?
-When served hot. One or two?

453
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,092
Your client.

454
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,067
What the fuck! Stop writing! Now!

455
00:31:37,168 --> 00:31:38,863
-I'm just--
-Shut up!

456
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,733
He calls his lawyer, that's supposed to be
the end of the interview.

457
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,206
Your client gave no statement,
we took no statement.

458
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,109
He just decided, voluntarily,
to write a letter to the victim's family.

459
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:51,477
-To say that--
-Shut up!

460
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,876
-Any charge here?
-No charge.

461
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:59,582
Good, get up. Go! Walk!

462
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:04,387
Listen to me, you don't say anything...

463
00:32:04,495 --> 00:32:07,020
you don't do anything,
you don't write anything.

464
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:08,189
Do you hear me?

465
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:09,493
Shut up!

466
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:13,730
How many times do I have to tell you people
the same fucking thing?

467
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:30,079
What the fuck is that?

468
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,017
Armoire. Louis Quatorze.

469
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:40,454
I mean, what is it, a toy?

470
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:45,361
Some of you I know.
Some of you I will know.

471
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:49,139
If you've ever worked with me before,
you know I don't want cowboy shit...

472
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,003
and I don't want surprises.

473
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:52,842
The task...

474
00:32:56,514 --> 00:33:00,245
is Avon Barksdale,
and Avon Barksdale only.

475
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:02,786
No sidetrips, no sprawl.

476
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:07,785
Primary investigators
are Greggs from my unit and--

477
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:14,458
Greggs from my unit
and McNulty from Homicide.

478
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,565
They keep the file.
On the street, we work partners.

479
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:22,131
Greggs and Sydnor. Herc and Carver.

480
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,805
McNulty's with Santangelo,
Mahone and Polk.

481
00:33:26,143 --> 00:33:28,111
Pryzbylewski and Freamon.

482
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,579
To start with, we got nine--

483
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:33,081
How's that? Did that get it?

484
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:36,453
What? Do you hear me?

485
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:38,247
What?

486
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:43,253
To start with, we have
nine or ten open homicide files...

487
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:45,488
to work back through for leads.

488
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:48,494
McNulty and Santangelo,
they're on that already.

489
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,592
Herc, Carver, Sydnor, and me,
we'll be targeting street dealers...

490
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:55,263
and rolling them back up
at Barksdale's people.

491
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:58,536
Polk and Mahone are available
to run down specific leads.

492
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:01,043
Freamon, Pryzbylewski,
are gonna start in-office...

493
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:02,544
on clerical duty.

494
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:06,083
-You need a prosecutor--
-No, turn the shit off!

495
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:07,877
What?

496
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,951
You need a prosecutor.

497
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:13,785
Rhonda Pearlman from Narcotics
is assigned.

498
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:18,189
Now, we don't have enough desks yet,
so we gotta share--

499
00:34:18,296 --> 00:34:20,696
-Y'all from Purchasing?
-No.

500
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:29,532
Like I was saying, we've been promised
some computers...

501
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,471
and surveillance equipment.

502
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:35,511
-Questions?
-Yeah, who signs the overtime slips?

503
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,410
No OT, unless prior authorization.

504
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:42,145
A case goes from red to black
by way of green, Lieutenant.

505
00:34:42,653 --> 00:34:45,178
You people bring me
something that needs OT...

506
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,847
you'll get OT...

507
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:50,450
until then, live on your fucking salaries.

508
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:07,144
"I'm very sorry for your father.
If I could've stopped it, I would have."

509
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,074
What can you do with this?

510
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:11,614
Nothing legally.

511
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:15,277
He doesn't put himself in,
or anyone else for that matter.

512
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:17,314
You can't read that letter...

513
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:19,753
and think that man was killed
for any other reason...

514
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:20,983
than he was a witness.

515
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:24,493
Why apologize at all
if you got nothing to do with it?

516
00:35:30,468 --> 00:35:32,493
We lost a state's witness.

517
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:36,036
Even in Baltimore,
that's supposed to mean something, right?

518
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,370
Just go to the deputy,
show him what's what...

519
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:40,341
and let's put something real together.

520
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:43,971
This case needs informants.
It needs long-term surveillance.

521
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:46,481
And eventually,
it's gonna need a Title 3 wiretap.

522
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:50,452
Most of all, it needs police who know
how to work those things.

523
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:54,055
You think it's good for business
to put it out on the street...

524
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:55,352
that our witnesses get killed?

525
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:57,927
You think it's not on the street already?

526
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:02,632
No grandstanding, no red balls.

527
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:05,463
Like I said, we get in and out.

528
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:23,815
Aunt June.

529
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,357
Yeah, I hope you're hungry.

530
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,688
Starving.

531
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:32,657
Hey, Dee!

532
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:35,225
What's up, baby?

533
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:37,323
-That your uncle?
-Yeah.

534
00:36:38,102 --> 00:36:39,763
I thought he'd look different.

535
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,839
My man, Dee. What's up, man?

536
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,703
This the little man?

537
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:48,634
Yo, you see how shorty
favor your nephew here?

538
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:52,607
What's up, little man?
You ain't gonna be able to deny that child.

539
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:56,652
You wanna come to me?
I know you tryin' to come to me.

540
00:36:56,754 --> 00:36:58,517
-Been napping.
-Yeah?

541
00:36:58,622 --> 00:36:59,680
Just woke up.

542
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,690
You got a grip, let me see your grip.

543
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:04,226
C'mon, give us a twirl, let's take a look.

544
00:37:06,697 --> 00:37:07,891
What you looking at?

545
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:09,932
-Go fix her a hot plate.
-All right.

546
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:12,730
Put everything on it.
She's the skinniest thing in here.

547
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:14,395
Come on, girl, we gonna hook you up.

548
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:16,666
Don't let that fool you, she can eat, man.

549
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:20,642
-How y'all doing? You doing good?
-Yeah, we all right.

550
00:37:20,744 --> 00:37:23,713
She want me to move in,
I'm thinking about it.

551
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:25,149
Let's walk.

552
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:25,706
Let's walk.

553
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:30,286
Here you come.
You gonna take my man from me?

554
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:31,445
Yeah.

555
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:34,220
Be careful with my little soldier.

556
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:37,289
-Got a name for that one?
-No.

557
00:37:37,928 --> 00:37:41,159
But he's one of the boys
they use in the stairwell.

558
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:43,733
-What about him?
-That's Little Man.

559
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:45,833
He's muscle.

560
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,070
You know his real name?

561
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:52,908
-Cl?
-Yeah.

562
00:37:53,344 --> 00:37:56,245
-You need some privacy?
-No, it's all right.

563
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:58,778
He's cool.

564
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:02,814
What's with the hat?

565
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:05,145
Go ahead, tell him, Bubbles.

566
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,553
I go down the way
with some hats that I'm selling.

567
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,094
If someone is someone you need to know...

568
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:15,393
I put the red hat on them
and Kima here take the pictures.

569
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,499
If they in the mix, they get another color.

570
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:19,296
If they ain't shit, they don't get shit.

571
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:21,803
Everyone in the hat's
part of Barksdale's crew?

572
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:23,396
At the Terrace.

573
00:38:23,774 --> 00:38:26,106
We haven't hit the low-rises yet.

574
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:28,543
That's sharp.

575
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:30,175
I like that.

576
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:31,976
Bubbles does not forget a face.

577
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:35,381
Ain't so good with names,
but, you know, faces I keep in my head.

578
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:39,183
I used to take him down to Escape Unit,
let him look through the warrant books.

579
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,659
He'd call me up that night,
telling me to go to this corner, that corner.

580
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:46,592
Yeah, paid $25 a pop.

581
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:49,222
-That's good money.
-Yeah.

582
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,167
How much does the hat routine pay?

583
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:53,897
Nothing.

584
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:56,030
We free on this.

585
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:01,506
-Motherfuckers beat my boy down.
-Who?

586
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:03,910
Little hoppers in the low-rises.

587
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:05,447
Who's your boy?

588
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:07,073
I got a friend.

589
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:09,613
Younger white boy.

590
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,382
Used to come down to the corners,
real green.

591
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:14,354
I was schooling him, you know?

592
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:15,925
What happened?

593
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:20,158
-They stomped him.
-You see it?

594
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,601
Fuck a man like that up
for a couple dollars, you know?

595
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:29,537
He still at University,
tubes all up in his nose.

596
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,131
Can't say but a fucking word or two.

597
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:36,506
But you know, that's how it goes, right?

598
00:39:37,414 --> 00:39:39,279
How you feeling, Bubbles?

599
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,346
Restless.

600
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:45,182
Yeah, I could tell.

601
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:46,547
What the fuck?

602
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:49,182
Can you hook a nigger up with
$10 then till tomorrow?

603
00:39:49,293 --> 00:39:52,057
I mean, you know, just to carry me, Kima.

604
00:39:58,335 --> 00:39:59,427
Bubbles.

605
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:03,067
Obliged.

606
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:07,443
Stay out of the projects
the next couple of days...

607
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:08,772
just to be safe.

608
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:11,143
Girl's always fretting over me.

609
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:14,742
-Change it up, Bubs.
-Yeah, yeah.

610
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:16,251
Go Eastside.

611
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,851
Yeah, yeah.

612
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,157
$20?

613
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:25,595
-You gonna spoil him with that shit.
-I respect the work.

614
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:32,228
They used your name, Stringer, Wee-Bey...

615
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:34,601
Savino, Peanut....

616
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:38,333
They knew a lot of names. They knew a lot.

617
00:40:38,442 --> 00:40:40,433
But you didn't say nothing?

618
00:40:41,378 --> 00:40:43,676
Shit, man, I don't know nothing.

619
00:40:44,148 --> 00:40:46,139
What was you writing then?

620
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:49,685
Yo, they was talking about
the man who got killed...

621
00:40:49,787 --> 00:40:51,379
and his kids, they asked me to write.

622
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:54,616
-What you got to do with them, Dee?
-Yeah, that's what I said.

623
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:57,250
Then they cried
about how the kids ain't doing so good.

624
00:40:57,361 --> 00:41:00,762
I'm like, it ain't gonna hurt for me
to say I'm sorry the man got killed.

625
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:03,264
Why the fuck you gotta say you're sorry?

626
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,835
Motherfuckers tried to
put your ass in the stir.

627
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:08,131
Yeah, but it didn't turn out that way.

628
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:11,537
You know, that's what I'm saying,
it's a shame that y'all....

629
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:17,975
I'm saying, it's a shame
what happened to that man, all right?

630
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:20,607
'Cause he didn't do anything
but come off the elevator...

631
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:23,619
when I was doing that thing
that I was doing.

632
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:27,054
What you think, cuz?

633
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:29,252
About what?

634
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,988
I'm saying, what you think
about what happened to the man?

635
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:34,530
You think we killed the motherfucker?

636
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:38,025
Speak your mind.

637
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:43,730
-Man, I don't know.
-Exactly.

638
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:45,974
You don't know,
and you don't need to know.

639
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:49,443
And if we did, we had a reason.
And if we didn't, we had a reason.

640
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:52,413
But either way,
you ain't got shit to do with it.

641
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:54,513
It ain't on you, cuz.

642
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,280
You feel me? It ain't on you.

643
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:00,519
Now, if you get jacked again...

644
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:03,855
I don't want to hear shit about
you writing nothing to no one.

645
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,929
-Got it?
-Yeah.

646
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:09,999
Come on, let's have some good times...

647
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,558
and get some ribs
before they done ate all the ribs up.

648
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:18,268
-This case isn't shit, Carv.
-I know it.

649
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:22,038
We're dancing around
with this motherfucker, typing shit out...

650
00:42:22,146 --> 00:42:24,376
taking pictures of assholes in hats.

651
00:42:24,481 --> 00:42:26,642
-What the fuck is that?
-It's bullshit.

652
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,617
I say we go down there right now.
Right fucking now.

653
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,314
We go into those towers,
and we let them know.

654
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:35,188
I'm serious.

655
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:38,523
You got to let these motherfuckers know
who you are.

656
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:41,028
You coming?

657
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:44,894
-I'm with you.
-Carv?

658
00:42:47,638 --> 00:42:49,128
What the hell?

659
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:51,238
Let's do it.

660
00:42:56,647 --> 00:42:57,841
Come on.

661
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:13,559
Shut it down. Five-O.

662
00:43:15,032 --> 00:43:17,159
Five-O, five-O, break out.

663
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,552
Yo, come here, man.
Come here, where you going?

664
00:43:38,655 --> 00:43:40,919
Don't act like you don't know me.
Get your hands up.

665
00:43:41,024 --> 00:43:42,457
Put that down.

666
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,256
-Drop that shit! Kiss the fucking ground!
-Put your hands up.

667
00:43:47,231 --> 00:43:49,529
Don't look at me like I ain't talking English.

668
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:53,296
You got a needle on you?
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?

669
00:43:53,537 --> 00:43:56,097
No? What's that?

670
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,598
What you got in your pockets?

671
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:00,870
You know what?
Put your pants down, man.

672
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:03,003
Put your pants down
and get down on the ground.

673
00:44:03,113 --> 00:44:05,411
Get down on the fucking ground!

674
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:09,749
All right, spread your shit out.

675
00:44:10,354 --> 00:44:12,754
Nice shoes. Think a happy thought.

676
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:19,090
Why don't you go somewhere else
with that bullshit?

677
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:22,796
No-good motherfuckers.

678
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,198
Stay down, man, stay down.

679
00:44:25,302 --> 00:44:28,237
Y'all can let Barksdale and them know
who owns these towers.

680
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:29,737
'Cause we're coming back.

681
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,740
-I'm sick of this shit.
-Kiss my ass!

682
00:44:31,842 --> 00:44:34,538
We roll out, come back in an hour,
catch everybody dirty.

683
00:44:34,645 --> 00:44:35,737
You'll see how that goes.

684
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:38,110
-That's bullshit, man.
-Yo, stay down, man.

685
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:41,275
That's fucked up. Man ain't did nothing.

686
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:44,077
Want something?

687
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:51,960
-Move, shitbird.
-I ain't doing nothing.

688
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:57,059
Really? I got nothing for you.

689
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:03,064
-My eye, my eye.
-Who you gonna eyefuck now?

690
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:07,033
Are you serious?

691
00:45:07,144 --> 00:45:09,442
You bleed on my car?
Don't bleed on my car.

692
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:11,480
Get your shit off my car.

693
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:20,219
What the fuck's the matter with you?

694
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:42,144
Got a visual?

695
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,604
Fuck.

696
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:46,705
Get the radio.

697
00:45:48,051 --> 00:45:51,020
1 1 :35, Signal 13.

698
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:53,752
771 Franklin, in the Court.

699
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:55,586
Son of a bitch!

700
00:45:55,692 --> 00:45:58,684
Shots fired, shots fired.
Officers need assistance.

701
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:02,026
I'm hit! Signal 13.

702
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:04,225
Officer down, Officer down!

703
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:12,866
Shit!

704
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:35,997
-Hello?
-You seen the paper?

705
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:39,063
-What?
-The newspaper, get it.

706
00:46:56,887 --> 00:46:58,286
Hey, kids.

707
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:21,735
Oh, no.

708
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,774
You happy now, bitch?

709
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:28,879
McNulty!

710
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:31,745
Where in fuck is he?

711
00:47:31,855 --> 00:47:35,552
He's detailed, Major, to Narcotics--

712
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:39,060
I fucking know where he's detailed.
I fucking already know that!

713
00:47:39,162 --> 00:47:40,129
Yes, sir.

714
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,131
-Where is he right now?
-I can page him, sir.

715
00:47:47,571 --> 00:47:49,596
Move that fucking desk out of my unit.

716
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:52,573
I do not want that
fucking man's desk in my unit.

717
00:47:52,676 --> 00:47:54,803
That's Crutchfield's desk.

718
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,704
Crutchfield's?

719
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:00,776
McNulty sits here.

720
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:11,316
-What the fuck was that about?
-Did you see today's paper?

721
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:14,488
-Just sports.
-You gotta check out the front page.

722
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:23,700
-What do you think they'll do to him?
-Let me tell you something.

723
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,436
If he gets caught with his dick up the ass
of the deputy's wife...

724
00:48:27,544 --> 00:48:32,379
he's still gonna have more of a career
than if they find out he's behind that story.

725
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:55,269
Lieutenant.

726
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,977
I saw the story in the paper.
I want you to know I had nothing to do....

727
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:24,160
-They jumped us, Boss.
-Who?

728
00:49:25,202 --> 00:49:26,669
Fucking project niggers.

729
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,762
What are you doing here
at 2:00 in the morning?

730
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:33,337
Field interviews, sir, police work.

731
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:35,502
-Police work?
-Yeah.

732
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:42,212
I got a 14-year-old in critical
but stable condition at University...

733
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,378
and two witnesses who say
one of you princes...

734
00:49:44,487 --> 00:49:46,455
cold-cocked him
with the butt-end of a pistol.

735
00:49:46,556 --> 00:49:48,387
-No, sir.
-I got his mother over at lID...

736
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:50,550
filing a formal brutality charge...

737
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,356
which for Herc will make an even four
in the last two years.

738
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:55,363
-None sustained.
-But all of them true.

739
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:56,523
We thought that--

740
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:59,193
I got one less Crown Vic
than I had last night.

741
00:49:59,302 --> 00:50:01,770
I'm out two Kevlar vests
that burned in the car...

742
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:04,238
two hand-held radios, a shotgun...

743
00:50:04,341 --> 00:50:07,777
and I'm about to lose this idiot here
for a week or two of medical.

744
00:50:07,878 --> 00:50:09,311
And for what?

745
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,608
What did you all learn
when you went to the Terrace...

746
00:50:12,716 --> 00:50:15,241
at 2:00 in the morning
to conduct field interviews?

747
00:50:15,352 --> 00:50:19,118
What valuable information did
we acquire from this situation?

748
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:25,291
IID is gonna be on all three of you
by afternoon...

749
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:28,363
and if you don't get a story straight
by then...

750
00:50:28,465 --> 00:50:32,834
you're gonna have a file thick enough
to see the light of a trial board.

751
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:37,701
Now tell me, who cold-cocked the kid?

752
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:47,641
Me.

753
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:52,279
Why?

754
00:50:54,357 --> 00:50:55,984
He pissed me off.

755
00:50:59,396 --> 00:51:02,593
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,
he did not piss you off.

756
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,130
He made you fear for your safety
and that of your fellow officers.

757
00:51:09,205 --> 00:51:11,264
I'm guessing now, but maybe...

758
00:51:11,374 --> 00:51:14,639
he was seen to pick up a bottle
and menace officers Hauk and Carver...

759
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:17,975
both of whom had already sustained injury
from flying projectiles.

760
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,641
Rather than use deadly force
in such a situation...

761
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:25,153
maybe you elected to approach the youth,
ordering him to drop the bottle.

762
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:28,083
Maybe when he raised the bottle
in a threatening manner...

763
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:31,592
you used a Kel-Light,
not the handle of your service weapon...

764
00:51:31,695 --> 00:51:33,822
to incapacitate the suspect.

765
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,565
Go practice.

766
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:41,133
You fuck the bullshit up
when you talk to lnternal...

767
00:51:41,237 --> 00:51:43,797
I can't fix it, you're on your own.

768
00:51:52,382 --> 00:51:55,545
-Push the arraignments back to 3:00.
-And the Gillette case?

769
00:51:55,652 --> 00:51:58,678
The Gillette trial goes back
on the move docket.

770
00:51:58,788 --> 00:52:01,382
Come on, walk with me. I'm running late.

771
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:05,988
-It wasn't me.
-The story quoted you.

772
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:09,156
Reporter has the story confirmed
when he calls me about the quote.

773
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:10,493
What am I gonna say?

774
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,366
No, he wasn't a witness?
No, he didn't testify in my court last week?

775
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:15,597
What?

776
00:52:15,872 --> 00:52:17,999
You don't think it's around
about the witness?

777
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:21,043
Lawyers, clerks, jurors, everybody talks.

778
00:52:21,144 --> 00:52:24,636
-I'm in the shit here, Your Honor.
-What can I tell you?

779
00:52:24,748 --> 00:52:28,081
I called the deputy, not the newspapers.
I gotta run.

780
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:36,316
-You should have hung them.
-If I hang them, I hang myself.

781
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,851
I'm the man in charge, remember?

782
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:41,954
Besides, you don't
give your people up to lID.

783
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:43,893
You don't do that.

784
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,333
Even if they put
a 14-year-old kid into Critical Care?

785
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:53,409
This case, it's just....

786
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:55,544
Get out of it.

787
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:59,011
-How do I do that?
-I don't know.

788
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:01,640
But you can't lose if you don't play.

789
00:53:02,886 --> 00:53:06,322
I always heard it
that you can't win if you don't play.

790
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:09,180
The department puts you on a case
it doesn't want.

791
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:12,352
You're given people
that are useless or untrustworthy.

792
00:53:12,462 --> 00:53:13,690
Correct.

793
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,462
If you push too hard,
and any shit hits the fan...

794
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:18,500
you'll be blamed for it.

795
00:53:18,768 --> 00:53:19,894
Correct.

796
00:53:20,003 --> 00:53:24,497
If you don't push hard enough, and there's
no arrest, you'll be blamed for that, too.

797
00:53:24,641 --> 00:53:25,869
Correct.

798
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:27,771
The game is rigged.

799
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:31,073
But you cannot lose if you do not play.

800
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:17,254
In the hole, y'all.

801
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:23,917
Hey!

802
00:55:25,094 --> 00:55:26,857
Hey, you fuckheads!

803
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,299
Hey, police!

804
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:03,756
-Hello.
-Lieutenant Daniels?

805
00:56:03,866 --> 00:56:04,924
Yeah.

806
00:56:15,745 --> 00:56:17,178
Who was that?

807
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:20,612
It was the duty officer
down at University hospital.

808
00:56:20,717 --> 00:56:22,207
What happened?

809
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:26,246
-He's blind in one eye.
-Who?

810
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:30,921
The kid. The 14-year-old.

811
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:41,921
