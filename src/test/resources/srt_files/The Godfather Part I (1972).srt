America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:58,261
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:03,141
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:07,729
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:12,275
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7

I didn't protest.

8
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:19,825
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,495
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,958
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:32,170
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:36,508
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:43,306
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,853
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:53,525
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:59,030
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,035
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:07,706
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:14,379

I went to the police,
like a good American.

23
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:38,028
These two boys were brought to trial.

24
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,865
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

25
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,075
but suspended the sentence.

26
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:50,248
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

27
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:55,837
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

28

29

Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

39
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:18,378
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

40
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:22,215
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

41

get into trouble.

43
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:31,850
You found Paradise in America.

44
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:38,815
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

45
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:41,651
You didn't need a friend like me.

46
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:46,823
But now you come to me and say,

47
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:49,367
" Don Corleone, give me justice. "

48
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:54,080
But you don't ask with respect.

49
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:58,877
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

50
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:07,510
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

51
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:10,138
BONASERA: I ask you for justice.

52
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:13,224
That is notjustice.
Your daughter is alive.

53
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:17,729
Let them suffer , then, as she suffers.

What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

57
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:48,551
If you'd come in friendship,

58
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:53,098
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

59
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:59,396
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

60
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:05,110
And then they would fear you.

When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

with a big bandleader.

184

And as his career got better and better ,
he wanted to get out of it.

Johnny is my father's godson.

him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

-What was that?
-Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

194
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:28,305
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

when he's been refused the first.

and let me tell you why.

300
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:56,892
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

301
00:30:56,975 --> 00:31:02,314
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

302
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:07,068
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her , to make her a big star.

303
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:09,946
Let me be even more frank.

304
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,993
To show you that  not a hard -hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

305
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:18,747
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

306
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:24,211
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

307
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:30,467
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

308
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,219
And she runs off.

309
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:37,682
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

310
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:42,938
And a man in my position can't afford

It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

363

They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

02:07:58,874 --> 02:08:01,210
All of you know me.

1078
02:08:02,169 --> 02:08:07,341
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

1079
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:14,849
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1080
02:08:14,932 --> 02:08:19,186
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1081
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:25,234
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

1082
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:30,031
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1083
02:08:30,114 --> 02:08:34,368
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1084
02:08:34,452 --> 02:08:39,540
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

1085
02:08:39,623 --> 02:08:41,834
Times have changed.

1086
02:08:41,959 --> 02:08:46,714
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1087
02:08:46,797 --> 02:08:49,633
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1088
02:08:49,759 --> 02:08:55,139
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1089
02:08:55,264 --> 02:08:59,810
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

1090
02:09:00,895 --> 02:09:04,482
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1091
02:09:04,607 --> 02:09:07,151
After all, we're not communists.

1092
02:09:10,279 --> 02:09:13,365
I also don't believe in drugs.

1093
02:09:13,491 --> 02:09:18,329
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1094
02:09:18,454 --> 02:09:21,582
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "

1095
02:09:21,665 --> 02:09:25,169
" If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

1096
02:09:25,294 --> 02:09:27,755
we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "

1097
02:09:29,173 --> 02:09:35,179
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1098
02:09:35,262 --> 02:09:40,017
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1099
02:09:40,142 --> 02:09:41,936
<i>That's an infàmia.</i>

1100
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:47,191
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1101
02:09:47,274 --> 02:09:50,444
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1102
02:09:57,034 --> 02:10:00,663
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1103
02:10:02,039 --> 02:10:08,712
And  willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1104
02:10:09,296 --> 02:10:13,801
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1105
02:10:13,884 --> 02:10:18,222
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1106
02:10:18,347 --> 02:10:22,059
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1107
02:10:22,184 --> 02:10:25,479
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger ,

1108
02:10:25,563 --> 02:10:28,149
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1109
02:10:28,232 --> 02:10:33,404
BARZINI : We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1110
02:10:33,529 --> 02:10:36,407
You talk about vengeance.

1111
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:39,743
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1112
02:10:39,827 --> 02:10:42,329
Or my boy to me?

1113
02:10:42,413 --> 02:10:45,207
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1114
02:10:48,002 --> 02:10:50,337
But I have selfish reasons.

1115
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:56,177
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1116
02:10:58,053 --> 02:11:00,598
because of this Sollozzo business.

1117
02:11:02,183 --> 02:11:06,020
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1118
02:11:06,103 --> 02:11:08,772
Cleared of all these false charges.

1119
02:11:10,232 --> 02:11:13,402
But  a superstitious man.

1120
02:11:13,527 --> 02:11:18,782
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¤,

1121
02:11:20,201 --> 02:11:23,787
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1122
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:26,707
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1123
02:11:27,958 --> 02:11:31,587
then  going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1124
02:11:33,255 --> 02:11:35,591
And that I do not forgive.

1125
02:11:38,052 --> 02:11:40,429
But, that aside

1126
02:11:43,474 --> 02:11:45,893
let me say that I swear

1127
02:11:47,478 --> 02:11:50,606
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1128
02:11:50,731 --> 02:11:55,069
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1129
02:12:20,594 --> 02:12:26,058
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1130
02:12:26,141 --> 02:12:28,227
Mention it. Don't insist.

1131
02:12:30,229 --> 02:12:35,150
-Barzini will know without being told.
-You mean Tattaglia.

1132
02:12:36,777 --> 02:12:38,737
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1133
02:12:39,822 --> 02:12:42,950
He could never have outfought Santino.

1134
02:12:45,327 --> 02:12:50,916
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1135
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:08,475
Come on, Nancy.

1136
02:13:09,685 --> 02:13:12,271
Keep together , everyone. Brian.

1137
02:13:13,605 --> 02:13:15,274
Okay, all right.

1138
02:13:28,329 --> 02:13:30,539
How long have you been back?

1139
02:13:31,332 --> 02:13:33,167
I've been back a year.

1140
02:13:34,585 --> 02:13:36,712
Longer than that, I think.

1141
02:13:39,548 --> 02:13:41,717
It's good to see you, Kay.

1142
02:13:52,728 --> 02:13:55,272
working for my father now, Kay.

1143
02:13:57,775 --> 02:14:00,778
He's been sick. Very sick.

1144
02:14:02,321 --> 02:14:04,281
But you're not like him.

1145
02:14:04,365 --> 02:14:08,160
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1146
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:14,416
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1147
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:18,003
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1148
02:14:19,171 --> 02:14:21,632
Like a senator or president.

1149
02:14:21,715 --> 02:14:24,176
-How naive you sound.
-Why?

1150
02:14:24,259 --> 02:14:27,054
They don't have men killed.

1151
02:14:30,265 --> 02:14:32,267
Who's being naive, Kay?

1152
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:37,815
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1153
02:14:39,358 --> 02:14:43,737
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1154
02:14:45,572 --> 02:14:49,535
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1155
02:14:50,953 --> 02:14:54,081
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1156
02:14:55,416 --> 02:15:00,254
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1157
02:15:00,337 --> 02:15:03,841
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1158
02:15:03,924 --> 02:15:07,761
-Please stop it, Michael.
-Because... I want you to marry me.

1159
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:12,057
-It's too late.
-Please, Kay...

1160
02:15:13,767 --> 02:15:17,688
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1161
02:15:19,523 --> 02:15:23,777
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1162
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:28,574
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1163
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:32,870
That we have children. Our children.

1164
02:15:34,371 --> 02:15:36,540
Kay, I need you.

1165
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,085
And I love you.

1166
02:16:02,191 --> 02:16:05,986
TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel
my territory and we do nothing about it!

1167
02:16:06,111 --> 02:16:09,740
-Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
-M ICHAEL: Be patient.

1168
02:16:09,823 --> 02:16:12,951
TESSIO:  not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1169
02:16:13,035 --> 02:16:16,163
M ICHAEL: Be patient.
CARLO: We must protect ourselves.

1170
02:16:16,246 --> 02:16:19,708
-Let me recruit some new men.
-M ICHAEL: No.

1171
02:16:19,791 --> 02:16:23,670
-Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.

1172
02:16:25,172 --> 02:16:27,382
CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...

1173
02:16:27,466 --> 02:16:31,553
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1174
02:16:31,637 --> 02:16:35,682
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1175
02:16:36,683 --> 02:16:39,394
Michael is now head of the family.

1176
02:16:39,478 --> 02:16:43,732
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1177
02:16:43,815 --> 02:16:46,235
After we make the move to Nevada

1178
02:16:46,318 --> 02:16:50,697
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1179
02:16:50,781 --> 02:16:55,118
-TESSIO: How long will that be?
-Six months.

1180
02:16:55,202 --> 02:16:58,455
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1181
02:16:58,539 --> 02:17:01,375
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1182
02:17:01,458 --> 02:17:07,130
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1183
02:17:07,214 --> 02:17:10,133
-Do you have faith in my judgment?
-Yes.

1184
02:17:10,217 --> 02:17:13,136
-Do I have your loyalty?
-Always, Godfather.

1185
02:17:13,262 --> 02:17:16,515
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1186
02:17:21,395 --> 02:17:26,775
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1187
02:17:26,858 --> 02:17:29,152
That's all I can tell you now.

1188
02:17:29,987 --> 02:17:32,614
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1189
02:17:32,698 --> 02:17:36,034
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

1190
02:17:36,118 --> 02:17:40,914
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1191
02:17:40,998 --> 02:17:43,542
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1192
02:17:43,625 --> 02:17:48,338
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1193
02:18:08,358 --> 02:18:12,195
-Thank you, Papa.
- happy for you, Carlo.

1194
02:18:12,279 --> 02:18:15,157
Mike... Why am I out?

1195
02:18:16,658 --> 02:18:19,411
You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.

1196
02:18:20,704 --> 02:18:23,957
Things may get rough with the move.

1197
02:18:24,041 --> 02:18:25,334
Tom.

1198
02:18:30,505 --> 02:18:35,677
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1199
02:18:35,761 --> 02:18:39,890
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1200
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:44,561
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1201
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:50,525
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1202
02:18:51,568 --> 02:18:54,613
-Maybe I could help.
-You're out, Tom.

1203
02:19:04,790 --> 02:19:06,291
(DOOR CLOSING)

1204
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:48,166
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1205
02:19:48,291 --> 02:19:52,838
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1206
02:19:52,921 --> 02:19:57,050
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1207
02:19:57,134 --> 02:19:59,469
Let me open the door , all right?

-All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

JOHNNY: Your brother Freddy.
FREDO: Girls?

02:20:22,033 --> 02:20:25,537
-Anything you want, kid, anything.
-Who are the girls?

1212
02:20:26,955 --> 02:20:30,333
-That's for you to find out.
-Get rid of them, Fredo.

02:20:31,877 --> 02:20:36,548
-Hey, Mike...
- here on business. Get rid of them.

1214
02:20:36,631 --> 02:20:39,301
tired. Get rid of the band too.

Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

Hey, come on! Scram!

1218

Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

What happened to Moe Greene?

1223
02:21:15,796 --> 02:21:20,175
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

02:21:20,258 --> 02:21:22,177
Well, give him a call.

02:21:23,512 --> 02:21:26,681
-Johnny, how are you?
-Nice to see you, Mike.

JOHNNY: Thanks.

1227
02:21:29,059 --> 02:21:32,687
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1228
02:21:32,771 --> 02:21:34,981
Well, I owe it all to him.

1229
02:21:36,191 --> 02:21:37,776
He knows how grateful you are.

1230
02:21:37,859 --> 02:21:41,112
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1231
02:21:41,196 --> 02:21:43,114
Mike, what can I do?

1232
02:21:44,282 --> 02:21:46,743
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1233
02:21:46,827 --> 02:21:49,704
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1234
02:21:50,539 --> 02:21:55,919
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1235
02:21:56,002 --> 02:21:58,755
-Tom!
-Are you sure?

1236
02:21:58,839 --> 02:22:01,842
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1237
02:22:01,925 --> 02:22:04,636
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1238

See, Johnny...

1239
02:22:08,431 --> 02:22:12,644
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1240

We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1241

in the movies to do the same.

I'll do anything for my godfather.

-How are you, Moe?

Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1250

Buy me out?

1251
02:23:01,318 --> 02:23:03,904
The casino, the hotel.

1252
02:23:03,987 --> 02:23:06,907
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1253
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:12,412
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1254
02:23:12,495 --> 02:23:15,916
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

time, and now you try to push me out!

1258

You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1259

Yes. First of all, you're all done.

You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

chased out of New York by the others.

with him and still keep my hotel!

around in public?

That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

so I had to straighten him out.
