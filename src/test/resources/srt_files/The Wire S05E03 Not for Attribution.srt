1
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,455
Type quieter, asshole.

2
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:39,042
Early relief.
So get the fuck out of here.

3
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,741
Jesus, Bunk.
What time is it?

4
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:42,983
4:30.

5
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,174
I couldn't sleep, so
get the fuck gone.

6
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,907
What time did Mcnulty
leave last night?

7
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:51,137
Never did.
He's in number one.

8
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,382
Pulling his hair out
over some shit.

9
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,040
Think again about what
the fuck you're doing.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,983
Bunk, this can work.

11
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,865
It can.

12
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:12,239
Fuck you. I mean that.

13
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,540
4:00 in the fuckin' morning?

14
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,341
Oh, so it is.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,422
All of these?

16
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:24,713
Homeless murders
from the last 5 years.

17
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:29,087
Everything before that is on microfilm,
but we got enough right here

18
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:30,842
Most of it open.

19
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:33,174
We don't do so well
with homeless kilings.

20
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:35,410
Transient locales,
no nearest, no dearest.

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,184
No one gives a fuck.
Cases stay open forever.

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,604
- You're going to jail behind this shit.
- Yes, you are.

23
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,107
You know what they do
to police in jail?

24
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,359
Pretty police like yourself?
Motherfucker,

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,832
We have kids.
Houses.

26
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:50,997
Car payments.
Furniture.

27
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,685
I just bought brand new lawn chairs

28
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:56,441
and a glass patio table.
You don't buy no shit like that if you

29
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,316
plan to lose your job
and go to prison.

30
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:00,659
- You won't even get past the m.e.
- Watch me.

31
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,274
You're dumping murders on us
that we can't solve.

32
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:06,808
- You're fucking our clearance rate.
- Fuck the fucking numbers already.

33
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:09,424
The fucking numbers destroyed
this fucking department.

34
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:12,133
Landsman and his clearance
rate can suck a hairy asshole.

35
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,935
Marlo ain't worth it.
Nobody is.

36
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:15,477
Marlo's an asshole.

37
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,266
He does not get to win.
We get to win.

38
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,877
This case doesn't go away

39
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:22,311
just because the bosses
can't find the money to pay for it.

40
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:25,849
These are fucking murders--
Ghetto murders, but still,

41
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:28,877
I came back out of the western
to work this case

42
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,610
because they said it would be worked.

43
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,932
I came back out on a promise,
and they're gonna keep that promise.

44
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:35,973
Whether they know it or not.

45
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,577
I'm gonna tell Landsman.

46
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,413
Yeah. You keep on with it,

47
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,040
I'm gonna rat you out.

48
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,914
You do what you got to do.

49
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:51,061
My name is
nowhere in the file.

50
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,327
I don't want fuck to do with this.

51
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:58,932
Hey, Bunk.

52
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:17,267
Captioning made possible
by home box office, inc.

53
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,064
What're you doing?

54
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:07,081
Final is out.
I want to see my story.

55
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,025
Now?

56
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:10,074
It's my first time out front.
I want to see it.

57
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,019
This is why we should
get home delivery.

58
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,190
Why pay for it when I get
it for free at the office?

59
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,511
Be back.

60
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:29,088
Brother ray.

61
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,691
God rest ye.

62
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,925
When does the "sun" get here?

63
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,344
Around now usually.

64
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,821
- Anybody got a working car?
- I got one,

65
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:07,756
but I'm going back out
to my crime scene for a canvass.

66
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,407
Drop me at the m.e.?

67
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:14,235
My office now.

68
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,632
I'll get a lift over
from one of the central cars.

69
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,525
This is way past any shit
you ever pulled in your life.

70
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,595
- Think on it.
- You see Greggs out there,

71
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:31,567
bagging evidence alone,

72
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,587
then going back out
to recanvass on a triple?

73
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,310
A triple fucking murder.
A home invasion,

74
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,541
and she's working it alone.

75
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:41,190
They pulled Crutchfield this morning,
put him back in the rotation.

76
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,843
- That's on them, but you can't--
- Fucking right, that's on them.

77
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:44,984
A triple murder,

78
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:48,574
and 12 hours later
they leave one detective alone on it?

79
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,426
I guess she's lucky
she has a car.

80
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,545
- This shit won't work.
- Then we're no worse than before.

81
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:56,896
- Extra red name or two on the board.
- Yeah, unless you got caught.

82
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:58,958
Who in this fucking unit
is gonna catch me?

83
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:02,044
Most of the guys up here couldn't catch
the clap in a mexican whorehouse.

84
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:04,964
What's with the red ribbon?

85
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:09,839
Barlow had an open strangle
a few years back.

86
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:12,972
Homeless guy with a red ribbon
tied around his wrist.

87
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,674
So that's two.

88
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:18,930
Also, I found an open homeless
case which Ray Cole worked.

89
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,073
I wrote a ribbon
into his office reports.

90
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:25,318
- So there's 3.
- Our guy didn't have a red ribbon.

91
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,759
- That's where I'm headed.
- Jesus.

92
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,117
- Listen to yourself.
- Upstairs

93
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:36,114
wouldn't jump on a real serial killer--
fuckin' Marlo,

94
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,041
who's got bodies all over hi

95
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:39,674
maybe they need the make-believe.

96
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:42,406
Yeah, maybe you're the asshole
just lost his fucking mind.

97
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:00,857
- <i>Crutchfield.</i>
- Yeah, I'm locked in the box.

98
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,101
- <i>In the box?</i>
- It's no joke. Let me out.

99
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,422
<i>Be right there.</i>

100
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,489
He fuck you?

101
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:15,385
He tried...

102
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,788
But mostly he just fucks himself.

103
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:25,007
You ain't seen those yet, huh?

104
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,796
I'll bet you didn't.

105
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,275
Fucking Burrell's asshole
must be so tight

106
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,013
you couldn't pull a pin from it
with a John Deere tractor.

107
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:38,187
Here you're promising
a double-digit drop,

108
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:39,850
and he gives you

109
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,840
a 4% bump

110
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,813
for two quarters in a row.

111
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:45,533
Thanks for bringing these by, Stan.

112
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,714
Well, I wanted to
give you a heads up.

113
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,320
Truth is,
looking at numbers like those,

114
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:54,402
I'm thinking you could do a lot worse

115
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:57,410
than give me a run
as acting commissioner.

116
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,727
I know you couldn't make me permanent.

117
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,622
maybe 6 months

118
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,132
while you keep grooming
your boy Daniels.

119
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:08,116
I'd get a pension bump,

120
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:11,999
and you'd get a head start
on clearing out deadwood,

121
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:15,518
beginning with Burrell
and Rawls.

122
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,848
Thanks, Stan.
Let me think on it.

123
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:20,887
You do that, Tommy.

124
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:32,092
Even on an acting basis,
can you imagine

125
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:36,106
Nerese and the Ministers dealing
with commissioner Valchek?

126
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:38,973
What are you gonna do
about the numbers?

127
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,473
Fuck can I do? I cut the department
budget to the bone, right?

128
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,141
Can't very well complain
when the crime rate bumps.

129
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,294
Burrell comes in here
and owns these,

130
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,909
I got to give him a pass--

131
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,298
at least until I can fix
his money problems.

132
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:58,362
Your piece took a bad bite there.

133
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:00,167
35 inches down to 12?

134
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:03,574
Yeah, well, it's my fault
for giving it up to the a-section.

135
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:05,561
Page one editor made
noises like it was

136
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,430
gonna go out front. Then he...

137
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,201
ossed it back to metro
before the double-dot.

138
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:13,110
Night editor didn't have room
to take it back, so...

139
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,402
Story deserved better. Sorry.

140
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,681
3 people murdered in a house,

141
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:21,258
and it gets 12 inches below the fold.

142
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:24,507
- Explain that to me.
- There's no explaining it.

143
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,040
Advertising's down,

144
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,841
we got a smaller news hole,
we're not managing it well.

145
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,574
We messed up.

146
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,091
That's all.

147
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,089
Wrong zip code.

148
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,041
They're dead where it doesn't count.

149
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,078
If they were white
and murdered in Tmonium,

150
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:46,868
you'd have had 30 inches off the front.

151
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,563
Would have been my first front-pager
where I didn't share a byline.

152
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:51,148
Yeah?

153
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:56,404
I drove down to the port covington plant
this morning to get a copy.

154
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:58,614
Well, you ain't the first to do that.

155
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:03,123
Our 10-7 on e floor yet?

156
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,021
He's by the overhead camera.

157
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,373
I need to grab prints,
get him I.D.ed.

158
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:10,499
Don't you want to wait for the post,
keep his hands clean for trace?

159
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,671
I need to know who my victim is.
That's the priority.

160
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:17,299
Finish your breakfast.
I got plenty of time.

161
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:06,328
There's nothing under the nails
that I can see.

162
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:08,111
I think we can risk prints.

163
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:24,575
Something's up.

164
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:26,827
Please. Gather around.

165
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:32,291
Steve, could someone get word
across the hall to features and sports?

166
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:33,959
We want everyone on this.

167
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:44,274
What, did we get sold again?

168
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:47,469
First the "L.A. Times" buys us up,
then the "Tribune."

169
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:48,641
Law of the fish.

170
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,188
- We're the minnow.
- Maybe we won a Pulitzer.

171
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,073
Pulitzers are still a week away.

172
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,601
It just turned April.

173
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,733
Look at Whiting's pants.

174
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:02,457
If we won a Pulitzer,
the executive editor would be tumescent.

175
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,267
Toom-what?

176
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:06,450
Speak English.
I'm just a police reporter.

177
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,581
Tumescent. Engorged.

178
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:10,118
Exactly.

179
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:13,719
It's a bad time for newspapers,
as you all know.

180
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:16,450
The news hole is shrinking

181
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,837
as advertising dollars
continue to decline.

182
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,384
Our circulation numbers
are also down as we compete with a

183
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:25,291
variety of media.

184
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,482
Technology is driving distribution,

185
00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:31,465
and the Internet

186
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:34,874
is a free source of news and opinions.

187
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:38,059
Seeking a balance in this new world,

188
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,208
we're now faced with hard choices.

189
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:46,234
We opened our first foreign
bureau in London in 1924.

190
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:51,555
The "Sun's" foreign coverage
has been a source of pride ever since.

191
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:55,147
So it is with

192
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:58,124
tremendous regret

193
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:03,281
that I tell you that Chicago
has made it clear that the bureaus

194
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,777
in Beijing,

195
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:09,274
Moscow, Jerusalem,
Johannesburg, and London

196
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,379
will all be shuttered.

197
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:14,870
Elsewhere in the newsroom,

198
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,980
there will be
a fresh round of buyouts.

199
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:21,318
Chicago has given us some specific

200
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,801
budgetary targets

201
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:25,529
that will require some hard choices

202
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,361
throughout the newsroom.

203
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:29,283
We are, quite simply,

204
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,746
going to have to find ways
to do more with less.

205
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,041
So I guess I will
turn this over to tom,

206
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:39,585
who will get into the specifics.

207
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:43,585
I know some of you have questions.

208
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,383
If you could hold them for me
until after I've had a chance to speak.

209
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,945
Pull your clipbook together.
Time to find a new home.

210
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,367
Chicago has sent us a memo

211
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,640
outlining options that are
available to those of you...

212
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,860
The aorta should have elasticity to it,

213
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,102
t it's rock hard.

214
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,807
Whoever strangled him could've
just waited a month or two more.

215
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:02,608
This guy was on his last legs.

216
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,273
It is what it is.

217
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,984
In addition to the fractured hyoid
and the bruising,

218
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:09,067
I got signs of a struggle
around the body,

219
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,563
a couple witnesses

220
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:13,678
who thought they heard sounds
of a struggle inside the house.

221
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,485
Also that ribbon you snipped off,

222
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,574
it might tie to other cases.

223
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:21,308
The ribbon my own investigator
missed at the scene.

224
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:23,864
It happens.
It was high on the wrist.

225
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,955
Cause and manner
is homicide by strangulation.

226
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,585
Good hunting, detective.

227
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:36,368
"and anyone requiring
additional information

228
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:39,001
"on cobra benefits
and pension payout as part

229
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:40,979
"of the voluntary separation plan

230
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:44,373
can schedule an appointment
with human resources."

231
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:47,111
Some of you will migrate
into new positions

232
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:49,044
while others will of course

233
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:52,331
be moving on to other opportunities
beyond the <i>Sun</i>,

234
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:55,496
but everyone in this room
has done excellent work

235
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,489
and should be proud
of their contributions.

236
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:03,141
- How many buyouts are there?
- That hasn't been determined yet.

237
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,993
We're talking to the union later today.

238
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:08,574
How'll this affect the upcoming contract
negotiations with the guild?

239
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,926
Badly.
Kiss any raise good-bye.

240
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:14,473
How come there's cuts in the newsroom
when the company's still profitable?

241
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:16,932
There's nobody that feels
worse about this than I do.

242
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,340
I've seen the excellent work
we've done here in Baltimore.

243
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,020
The sooner we start
meeting with you individually,

244
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,566
the sooner I can answer
all of your questions.

245
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,473
- Not O'mara.
- Yeah.

246
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:34,133
Aw, no.

247
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,387
Good luck everybody.

248
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,435
No increase in felonies
and a 1% bump in total crime.

249
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,308
Do you vouch for these figures?

250
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,339
- Sir?
- No increase in crime

251
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:52,441
even after I cut you guys to the bone.
This is what you're telling me?

252
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,506
Because the one thing I'm
asking of you guys--

253
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,972
the one thing
that I'm asking above all--

254
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,766
is that you bring me clean numbers.

255
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,500
Yes, Mr. Mayor.
You made that clear.

256
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:06,618
Very good then.

257
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,174
Burrell is done.

258
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:24,409
He just killed himself.
We leak the real stats,

259
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,649
hold the cooked ones
in case he won't go quietly.

260
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,241
And replace him with who?

261
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:31,308
Rawls?
He came in with the same stats.

262
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,874
If I know Bill Rawls,
he'll be calling over here as

263
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,814
soon as he gets back to his office,

264
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,101
telling us he warned Burrell
against cooking the books.

265
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:41,600
The ministers won't live with Rawls.
Neither will Nerese.

266
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,777
As acting commissioner,
they will for a few months at least

267
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:46,803
if we've got a black
candidate to sell them.

268
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,051
Daniels isn't ready.

269
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:49,691
He's only been Colonel for a year.

270
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:51,554
A year will do in a pinch.

271
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:56,370
You float it with one of your
bunkies on Calvert street.

272
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:57,987
See how it plays.

273
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:00,881
Burrell reads that,
he'll shit melons.

274
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,204
I fucking hope so.

275
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:04,379
It's Baltimore.

276
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:07,463
No one lives forever.

277
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:25,567
Andreas, right?

278
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:29,945
The Russian sent me.

279
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:34,701
Need you to get a word to Vondas.

280
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,522
He got a new friend.*

281
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,365
I never hear the name.

282
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,080
Just let him know Marlo
came past with a gift.

283
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,623
Be at you same time tomorrow.

284
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:07,477
Any idea how long this could take?

285
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:10,480
Don't know.
Might be here all day.

286
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:13,107
I have meetings scheduled.

287
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,903
We've got to lay
the foundation carefully,

288
00:21:16,063 --> 00:21:17,738
make it so the grand jurors understand

289
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:20,950
all the ins and outs
so they don't get lost in the details.

290
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,284
Mr. Howard?

291
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:35,464
Is there any way
I could go earlier?

292
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,883
If you're important enough, sure.

293
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,262
I'm the vice president
of a major financial institution.

294
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:44,624
Who the fuck isn't?

295
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,569
Now, sir, directing your attention
to the document in your hand,

296
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:52,558
is that also an account statement?

297
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,924
Yes, it is,

298
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,309
for a non-profit,
interest-bearing account,

299
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,658
organizational,
with 5013 designation.

300
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:04,242
Can begin by slowly
explaining in the most basic terms

301
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:08,690
each of those things,
beginning with the word non-profit?

302
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:11,983
- Hey, is box two open?
- Not yet.

303
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:13,357
What about 3?

304
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,504
Someone's killing homeless men.

305
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:18,271
Medical examiner says so.

306
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,712
Weird thing about my case, Bunk?

307
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:32,771
Dead man was homeless,
but he had a red ribbon

308
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:34,558
tied around his wrist.

309
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:36,651
What does a homeless guy
have to remember

310
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:39,488
that he should have a red ribbon
tied around his wrist?

311
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:44,958
- Burlow.
- What?

312
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,535
Nice out.

313
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:49,706
Oh, like Chanel no. 5
comes out of your ass, moreland.

314
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:57,790
If you got a problem,
then I got a problem.

315
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:00,034
That's how the co-op work.

316
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,287
What's the problem?

317
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,977
I got too much money.

318
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,911
Son, believe me,
you ain't alone.

319
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:13,217
What to do with the shit
we sell ain't no thing.

320
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,024
In Baltimore,
dope and coke sell themselves,

321
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:19,198
but the money that come back?

322
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,357
Ain't enough mattresses, is there now?

323
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:24,489
You got any ideas?

324
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:28,180
A few.

325
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:30,440
If you askin'.

326
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,149
- Not Twigg.
- Damn.

327
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,324
Guy gives 20 years to the paper,
and this how it ends?

328
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,280
Fact of the matter is,
it's more profitable these days

329
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,340
to run a worse paper for less money.

330
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,342
Cut back people and pages,

331
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:45,741
you increase revenue.

332
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:47,971
If we're lucky,
they'll just get rid of deadwood.

333
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,933
How'd it go?

334
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:55,990
"You've done excellent work."

335
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:58,736
Without being explicit,
they gave me a choice--

336
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:01,651
either the copy desk or the buyout.

337
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:03,445
- You're kidding, right?
- Apparently,

338
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:05,412
they can hire
one-and-a-half 20-somethings

339
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:07,517
for what it costs to keep
me in print, so...

340
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:09,258
Damn, Roger.

341
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,870
- Sorry, man.
- Fuck it.

342
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,907
I might as well get to work
on the <i>Great American Novel</i>.

343
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:22,331
<i>Gus, come on in.</i>

344
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:38,533
Have a seat.

345
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:44,427
Relax, gus.
We need you here.

346
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,285
We value your dedication.

347
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,329
You've done excellent work.

348
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:57,059
We're counting on you
to transition the new team.

349
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,620
There's still going to be
excellent talent out there

350
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,796
- that needs to be developed.
- What kind of team's going to be left?

351
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,910
We're losing good people,

352
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,634
but we expect to retain
the core of a solid staff.

353
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:09,966
Doing more with less.

354
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:13,598
That's what we have
to contemplate going forward.

355
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:15,763
More with less, huh?

356
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:18,132
Look at this.

357
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,165
A red ribbon in one
of Ray Cole's files.

358
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:26,850
Cole left a note with it.
"Found on left wrist of victim.

359
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,780
Check against other cases."

360
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:31,324
Hey, hon.

361
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:34,117
How's the stain look on the cabinets?
They dry yet?

362
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:37,634
Great.
I'm on my way.

363
00:25:57,406 --> 00:26:00,499
This is the hard part,
getting these guys to give a shit.

364
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:02,905
Let's get a taste. I'm buying.

365
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:06,991
You think I'm drinking with you?

366
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,351
Go home, Jimmy.

367
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:10,989
- Think your weak shit through, man.
- Go home?

368
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,450
For the love of God,
I'm working a serial killer.

369
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:26,963
You want to talk on it?

370
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:34,811
Went with Chris and them,

371
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,036
set up on this family.

372
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,597
Everything so serious now.

373
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,138
Yo, little man, you
finish your howork?

374
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,906
'cause it's late now,

375
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,299
and it's only gonna get later
if we don't roll home soon.

376
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:56,706
Ain't no school tomorrow.

377
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,117
Teacher meetings.

378
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,622
We should do something, mike.

379
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,042
Got my corner to run.

380
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:07,328
What?

381
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:09,420
What, nigga?

382
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:12,776
Six Flags be open again.*

383
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,837
That shit's taking forever.

384
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:22,224
Complicated stuff, I suppose.

385
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:24,758
It's more like
Joe make it complicated.

386
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:26,923
That nigga got a thing
for conversation.

387
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,617
Not like Marlo.

388
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,665
Definitely not.

389
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,518
Now, see, pastor here,

390
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:39,190
he one of about 3
I like to give money to.

391
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,528
Help with his good works
and all that.

392
00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:42,824
Good works?

393
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:46,923
He down with all kind of missionary work
going on down in the islands.

394
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:49,587
You know,
building a church for some folk,

395
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:51,725
a schoolhouse for some other folks,

396
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:53,591
all kind of good shit like that.

397
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,090
And what else y'all building?

398
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,721
- A hospital.
- Hospital, yeah.

399
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:02,289
Except they been building that mess
for about 10 years now,

400
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:04,290
and nothing ever actually get finished.

401
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:05,988
How you gonna clean my money?

402
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:08,624
Got accounts at some
of the banks down there.

403
00:28:08,994 --> 00:28:10,727
Donations come in as cash,

404
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,350
cashier's checks come out.

405
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:15,113
Tiny-ass Caribbean island

406
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,240
don't truck with no subpoenas,
no court orders,

407
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,617
- none of that.
- You pay 10 on the dollar.

408
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:22,491
Anything beyond that
depends on your generosity,

409
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,998
to save those who want to be saved.

410
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:54,450
I'm back.

411
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:56,415
I can see that.

412
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:05,986
Again.

413
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,929
I saw your text message
on my cell phone today,

414
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:13,233
it took me a minute remember
who the hell you were.

415
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:15,141
- It ain't been that long.
- Shit.

416
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:18,478
When you left,
I was still covering the labor beat.

417
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:20,891
We ain't had a labor reporter
around here in 3 years.

418
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,048
Yeah, well, now you the big,
bad city editor,

419
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,984
I'm whoring myself for politicians.

420
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:29,938
You got out
just at the right time, too.

421
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:32,923
- That bad, huh?
- Chicago is killing us.

422
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,155
One buyout after another.

423
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,405
I can't even begin to think
what our next round

424
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:40,827
of guild negotiations is gonna be like.

425
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:43,284
Enough of me crying.

426
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:46,496
What are you selling tonight,
dear Norman?

427
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:49,707
Carcetti's planning
to shitcan Burrell.

428
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,836
He's talking to people and
considering replacements.

429
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,337
City hall source?

430
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,507
Who's the leading candidate?

431
00:29:57,724 --> 00:30:01,264
Rawls, deputy for operations,
might have the job for a few months,

432
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:04,390
but there's a front runner
from deeper in the department.

433
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,857
Cedric Daniels.

434
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,309
It's been a while since
I've been on the street there, Orman.

435
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:09,604
Who's this Daniels?

436
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:11,324
Chief of detectives.
Polished.

437
00:30:11,484 --> 00:30:12,711
Holds a law degree.

438
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:15,124
Brought closure
to some high-level cases.

439
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:19,070
His ex-wife got herself
elected to the council last go-round.

440
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:22,826
I always liked photos
with my stories.

441
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,441
And this is aimed at who?

442
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,794
The ministers?
Nerese?

443
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:34,032
You want to see if they can live
with this fella here, right?

444
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:36,094
A- ight.

445
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,592
From one whore to another.

446
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,311
What the fuck?
Check this shit out.

447
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,034
Beautiful.

448
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:57,086
Holy shit.
Look at this motherfucker.

449
00:30:58,351 --> 00:30:59,777
Hit him with the spot.

450
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,497
C.I.d. Figures, don't it?

451
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:26,091
Where y'all need to go?

452
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,305
Down Six Flags.

453
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:29,057
You talkin' round trip?

454
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,833
Run you two hundred plus gas.

455
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:34,208
Where you at?

456
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:42,320
I got 150, gas included
if it even get us there.

457
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,990
Don't be fretting on the ride now.
This motherfucker tried and true.

458
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:49,058
A- ight.

459
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:52,664
I got half when we get there
and half on the way back.

460
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:01,058
I guess you're not up for a story.

461
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:06,174
- I need something worked on right away.
- What do you got?

462
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:08,557
Mayor's thinking
about firing the police commissioner.

463
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:10,464
He's floating the idea anyway.

464
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,109
No problem. I'm all over it.

465
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,790
What do you know about Daniels?

466
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,891
- Who is he?
- C.I.D. Commander.

467
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,691
Came out of the eastern D.E.U.

468
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:23,152
married to the Daniels
that won the council seat in '06.

469
00:32:23,312 --> 00:32:25,184
Brought in a couple
of big wiretap cases,

470
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,106
they gave him the western,
hoping to clean up that district

471
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,190
after they shitcanned Bunny Colvin.

472
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,413
Since getting separated, he's been
shacked up with Ronnie Pearlman

473
00:32:33,573 --> 00:32:35,482
over at the state's attorney's office.

474
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:37,208
No suction early in his career,

475
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:39,335
but now that he's got Carcetti's ear,

476
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:41,291
now the brass stay out of his way.

477
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,698
What's the man's favorite color?

478
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:51,849
You sure?

479
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:54,605
Yeah, what the hell?
I'm already on the clock.

480
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,821
- <i>Ops bureau.</i>
- Hi, darlin'.

481
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,574
It's Roger Twigg
with the <i>Sunpapers</i>.

482
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,467
- <i>Hey, roger</i>.
- Is the deputy around?

483
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,225
- <i>Sure</i>.
- Thanks, hon.

484
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:16,374
An hour or two,
I'd have had it surrounded.

485
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:17,633
No doubt.

486
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:21,640
While Mr. Deadwood here's
working the story,

487
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:25,300
see if you can feed him
some react quotes.

488
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:30,123
It's a generous gift, but...

489
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:33,848
your money,
the money you bring me,

490
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:35,642
I don't need.

491
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,193
Money is money.

492
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,303
What's the difference
who bring it to you?

493
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:47,445
It's dirty money.

494
00:33:49,146 --> 00:33:50,221
It stinks.

495
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:55,140
- We ain't in the same business?
- The bills are from the street.

496
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:57,409
They're dirty, you understand?

497
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,208
Everything runs through joe.

498
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:03,346
Everything is clean with Joe.

499
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:06,673
Ain't a problem.

500
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,591
Good.
Good-bye.

501
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:22,457
Hey, Bunk.

502
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,974
What kind of knot
you say was on that red ribbon?

503
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,907
The one on the homeless guy's wrist.

504
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,415
Ck yourself with your red ribbon.

505
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:34,023
Just thought of something.

506
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:37,286
I caught a vagrant months back had
a red ribbon tied around his wrist.

507
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,968
You remember that?

508
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,874
Hell of a catch, detective.
Hell of a catch.

509
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,612
Can I see your file?

510
00:34:51,294 --> 00:34:52,441
Clean bills?

511
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,604
You mean laundered, right?

512
00:34:55,798 --> 00:34:57,140
I just showed you how.

513
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,641
Naw. He mean clean,

514
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:01,057
like the money straight out
the bank and shit.

515
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:03,979
- All lookin' nice.
- See, people ain't right.

516
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,019
Here you are tryin'
to pay a motherfucker,

517
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,359
an' all he worried about
is what the money look like.

518
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:11,341
Normally, my fee for this
would be 20 on the dollar.

519
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,342
40,000 to make it look nice.

520
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:15,283
You need this back today, too.

521
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:18,274
Might ordinarily charge more,

522
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:21,998
but seeing as how we co-op,
no charge.

523
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:25,877
Speaking of co-op,

524
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:27,670
tell them niggas that got burnt

525
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:30,226
I'm givin' away 50
for a line on Omar's people.

526
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:34,474
His sister, his me-maw
some faggy he be with.

527
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,512
All that shit count, you hear me?

528
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:39,667
- I'd let sleeping dogs lie, son.
- Oh, I know you would, Joe.

529
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:41,674
You smart like that.

530
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:43,519
Me?

531
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:46,290
Anyway, pass that offer on.

532
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:48,615
Come back for this here in an hour.

533
00:35:58,174 --> 00:35:59,699
Boy want omar bad.

534
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:02,226
I ain't giving him a thing on Omar.

535
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,563
Omar been gone.

536
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,241
Took a lot
of bad history with him, too.

537
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,940
Why in the hell would I want
that motherfucker back?

538
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,874
How fast you think we were
going on that first drop?

539
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,885
- 75 an hour.
- That's it?

540
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,212
Felt like I was coming out
of my seat, man.

541
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:21,098
You always knowing
stuff like that. How?

542
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:22,834
Ooh, over there!

543
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:29,607
Y'all throwin' some bricks.

544
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:32,764
Put a little touch on it.

545
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,470
Watch.

546
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,705
Put some backspin on it, or else
it'll bank off the box and not in it.

547
00:36:50,384 --> 00:36:51,379
Hold this.

548
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,007
- So where Fairfax at?
- Northern Virginia.

549
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,474
- How about you?
- I live up Baltimore.

550
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:59,198
That's so cool.
You two have your own place?

551
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,368
- Yeah, and Bug.
- That's tight.

552
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:30,918
Madman on the loose, huh?

553
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:33,170
3 linked cases and counting.

554
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:36,494
He's killing vagrants, is he?

555
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,599
Don't say I didn't warn you.

556
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:52,246
Who covers us for the
<i>Sunpapers</i> nowadays? Twigg?

557
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:55,301
Him or this new girl.
Alma something.

558
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,734
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>. Gutierrez.

559
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,005
Ok. Can I meet you?

560
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:24,120
Do you know Al Pacino's?

561
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,572
How about half an hour?

562
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,841
Ok. See you then.

563
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,887
Good react quote from
me in metro write.

564
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:39,039
Scott, come here.

565
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:42,698
This quote, here.

566
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:46,108
"Carcetti may be holng the knife,
but Daniels sharpened it for him.

567
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:49,197
He's been critical
of Burrell since the election."

568
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,090
Good shit, huh?

569
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,880
Yeah, from a high-ranking
city hall source?

570
00:38:54,286 --> 00:38:56,377
You feel comfortable telling me
where you got that?

571
00:38:56,537 --> 00:38:58,047
Not really, it being a source.

572
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,412
It's a great quote, but, uh,

573
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:04,676
if you're gonna-- if you're gonna
slam somebody anonymously,

574
00:39:04,836 --> 00:39:06,722
I at least have to be sure
that the quote--

575
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:08,224
Nerese Campbell.

576
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,893
She's not gonna slam
the Mayor's choice publicly,

577
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:13,312
but not-for-attribution,
that's her quote.

578
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,040
You got Nerese to say that, huh?

579
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,858
Twigg's not the only guy
with game around here.

580
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:39,365
Let Vondas know I ain't mean
no misunderstanding earlier.

581
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:57,554
How do you know they're connected?

582
00:39:57,714 --> 00:40:00,553
Is there D.N.A. Evidence
or a signature?

583
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:03,279
We can't release that yet.
You know, copycats.

584
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:05,024
So there is a signature.

585
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:07,628
What?

586
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:09,493
You're good.

587
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,080
- You're new, right?
- 5 months.

588
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,224
I worked at the <i>Sun-sentinel</i>
in Lauderdale before this.

589
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:18,669
I've read your stories.
They're good.

590
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:20,830
Bullshit, but thanks.

591
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:24,850
You're gonna run
something right away, right?

592
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,138
We got to get the word out on this.

593
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,013
What kind of name is Alma?

594
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:32,885
I have a boyfriend, detective.

595
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:35,938
He bigger than me?

596
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:39,117
Can I ask you why
on the day in question

597
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:41,942
you were operating the senator's car
when you were detained by city police

598
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:44,046
with $20,000 in cash?

599
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:47,491
On advice of my attorney,
I ain't gonna answer that.

600
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,750
Ya'll trying to criminate me here.

601
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:54,365
Mr. Price, you are employed
as a driver for senator Davis,

602
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:57,500
earning 30,000 a year,
is that correct?

603
00:40:57,771 --> 00:40:59,284
- Yeah, so?
- Yet,

604
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,663
it is my understanding that

605
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:05,216
you are also drawing a $40,000 salary

606
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:09,217
as the executive director
of the west Baltimore hoops charity

607
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,953
and another 30,000

608
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:14,823
as the fundraising director
for the senator's day-care initiative.

609
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,809
How are you able to earn 3 salaries,

610
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:22,217
working 3 jobs
at the same time, Mr. Price?

611
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:32,078
You have a nice day.

612
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,790
Blind motherfucker.

613
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:39,708
His joint on Collington
on the east side of the street.

614
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:42,553
If he give up Omar, though,
I want in on that shit.

615
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:45,006
Nigga put a gun in my face, man.

616
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:48,105
- Joe know about Butchie?
- Motherfucker, I know about him.

617
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:49,943
Joe don't know shit about this here,

618
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,887
and he ain't need to know.

619
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:53,984
Now where my cheese at, man?

620
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,057
The fuck you been at, nigga?

621
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:23,878
Wasn't no school today, so we took Bug
to do something. Ain't no thing.

622
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,791
It is when you don't tell no one.

623
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:29,049
Now I had to come down here all day long
to make sure your shit is straight.

624
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:30,638
This your corner or what, nigga?

625
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,666
I'm checking now to make sure
shit's right at the end of the day,

626
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:34,938
a-ight?

627
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:38,617
- Yo, count right?
- Yeah. All straight.

628
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,605
Ain't the point, and you know it.

629
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:42,521
Chris already heard about this shit.

630
00:42:45,957 --> 00:42:47,401
Nice dolphin, nigga.

631
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,590
Let's go home, man.
I'll deal with this bullshit later.

632
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:02,333
That's 400 in your own
account down in the islands.

633
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,524
There no hurricane,
department of justice,

634
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,957
or nigga with a gun can tap that.

635
00:43:09,116 --> 00:43:10,466
How I even know it's there?

636
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,549
You check it online
any time you like.

637
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,044
On a computer?

638
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,097
- If I can't hold it in my hand--
- A- ight.

639
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:19,099
You got any prior convictions?

640
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:20,809
No, nothing that rate.

641
00:43:21,156 --> 00:43:23,420
We get you a passport then.

642
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:26,690
Take a trip.

643
00:43:40,315 --> 00:43:43,013
Ain't easy civilizing
this motherfucker.

644
00:43:45,009 --> 00:43:46,633
We chose poorly, gus.

645
00:43:49,255 --> 00:43:52,913
At this rate, there won't be much
to call a newspaper in 10 years.

646
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:57,138
You know, my father
worked over at armco, right?

647
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,719
And every morning
before he went to work,

648
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:02,471
he'd sit at the table,

649
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:05,407
reading the newspaper
with a cup of coffee,

650
00:44:06,658 --> 00:44:08,473
and no one could interupt him

651
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:11,495
for that 15 minutes
before he walked out the door,

652
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,328
and I remember watching him, thinking,

653
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:19,340
"What the hell is so important
about that damned paper?

654
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:22,891
I want to be part of that."

655
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:26,617
Made me want to be a newspaperman.

656
00:44:30,965 --> 00:44:33,791
One day I was cutting class
at Patterson,

657
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:36,490
and there was this man
on the downtown bus

658
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,869
folding his broadsheet just so.

659
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:44,164
And the way that man folded that paper

660
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,401
and concentrated on reading those pages

661
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:51,057
made him look like the smartest
son of a bitch on the bus.

662
00:44:51,711 --> 00:44:53,839
It was just one of those moments.

663
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:02,590
"If, ever I depart this vale,

664
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:04,986
"and you ever remember me

665
00:45:05,146 --> 00:45:07,356
"and have thought to please my ghost,

666
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:10,383
"forgive some sinner,

667
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,957
"and wink your eye
at some homely girl."

668
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:16,242
Fuck Henry Mencken.

669
00:45:21,493 --> 00:45:22,897
I forgive you, gus.

670
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:08,750
Oh, my God.

671
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:14,091
You see that quote from somebody
about me stabbing Burrell in the back?

672
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:16,324
That's a damn lie.

673
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:17,836
So what?

674
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:21,365
You're going to be
named commissioner.

675
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:25,751
This is good news.
How is this not good news?

676
00:46:35,245 --> 00:46:36,233
Thanks.

677
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:39,392
Cheap motherfucker.

678
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:09,975
No, no, see.

679
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:13,709
If you stack it with the domestic beer,
then I won't know.

680
00:47:14,906 --> 00:47:17,129
Cut a blind man some slack, hear?

681
00:47:21,312 --> 00:47:23,706
- Y'all servin'?
- If you got some I.D. on you.

682
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,557
Who was that?

683
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:30,350
Little girl.

684
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:43,572
- Cash is in the register.
- Fuck the register, old man.

685
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:51,587
They all up in your shit.
They going after every damn thing.

686
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,290
Do you hear me?

687
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:54,905
We going to jail.

688
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,874
Focus, motherfucker, focus!

689
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,052
Look here.

690
00:48:05,852 --> 00:48:09,377
Back in the girdle ads
underneath the story about the-

691
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:13,308
the school board approving
a name change for p.s. 114,

692
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,194
it's--
it's Jimmy Mcnulty's ripper.

693
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:20,250
You know why they call them homeless?

694
00:48:20,617 --> 00:48:23,570
Because they ain't got a pot to piss in,
and you know why they ain't got a pot?

695
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:25,739
Because nobody gives a good fuck.

696
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:30,418
Shake it for another day or two,
and then you're back in the rotation.

697
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,574
You done with this stupid shit?

698
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,245
Who the fuck do you need
to hear it from, Jimmy?

699
00:48:43,314 --> 00:48:45,844
You have to let Burrell know
that this isn't coming from you.

700
00:48:46,004 --> 00:48:47,135
That won't matter.

701
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:49,191
After what he read today,
I'm the threat.

702
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:50,624
Then you have to tell him

703
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:53,016
that you won't take the job,
that you don't want his chair.

704
00:48:53,176 --> 00:48:54,518
And he believes me?

705
00:48:54,983 --> 00:48:57,720
The alternative is that he goes public
with what he knows,

706
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,357
whatever he has about the old days.

707
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,485
- He sat on it this long.
- You said yourself,

708
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:07,649
he'd rather bury that file than to
embarrass the department on his watch,

709
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:09,992
but if it's between you
and him surviving,

710
00:49:10,444 --> 00:49:12,506
what do you think he'll do then?

711
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:22,417
How much could even be in that file?
An assets investigation?

712
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:23,956
Some loose talk?

713
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,157
It was so long ago.
Most of those guys have moved on.

714
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:28,818
He only needs smoke.

715
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:31,790
He doesn't even need fire
to drag you down,

716
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,364
to drag me down.

717
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:36,619
Everything that we have
worked so hard for.

718
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,107
We've already lost enough.

719
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,531
What other people Omar got?

720
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:54,004
Cosucker the one got the trouble.

721
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:57,372
No need for you to stand tall on it.

722
00:50:02,975 --> 00:50:04,588
It don't have to be messy.

723
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:07,355
Ain't no other way.
I can see that.

724
00:50:20,742 --> 00:50:22,036
Where I find Omar?

725
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,084
Where Omar at?

726
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:42,826
You a tough old man.

727
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:10,641
When word get to Omar,

728
00:51:11,313 --> 00:51:13,156
make sure he hear everything.

729
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:23,197
We still ain't got no line on the man,

730
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:25,025
and now he comin' at us.

731
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,548
We gonna change up.

732
00:51:26,986 --> 00:51:29,824
Marlo got to move indoors.
The rest of us need to live on the run.

733
00:51:29,984 --> 00:51:31,724
Fucked-up plan, you ask me.

734
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:33,358
Marlo wants Omar.

735
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:35,303
What else you need to know?

736
00:51:39,084 --> 00:51:41,476
You making your move on Burrell,
and I don't blame you,

737
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:43,890
and the thing is,
I can help with that.

738
00:51:44,172 --> 00:51:47,243
The ministers, Nerese,
black legislative caucus--

739
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:50,819
- I can bring them around for you.
- Feel free.

740
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:54,322
All I need is some help
with this grand jury nonsense.

741
00:51:54,884 --> 00:51:55,866
You go to Bond,

742
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:58,415
- you tell Bond that--
- I can't help you with that.

743
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:01,342
Story's been out all day,
and our phone isn't ringing.

744
00:52:01,808 --> 00:52:03,300
The ministers, Nerese, the caucus,

745
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,375
they're willing
to live with Daniels apparently.

746
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:07,093
Thanks anyway.

747
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,886
Thinking you can cut Clay loose, huh?

748
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,460
Thinking I'm done.

749
00:52:45,198 --> 00:52:46,163
Bonjour.

750
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,291
Came to see my account.

751
00:52:48,995 --> 00:52:50,638
Vous parlez pas francais?

752
00:52:51,396 --> 00:52:52,690
Y'all got my money?

753
00:52:52,986 --> 00:52:54,591
Je ne parle pas anglais.

754
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:01,515
This mine.

755
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:03,391
- Y'all got my money.
- Oui, monsieur.

756
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:05,571
J'ai juste besoin de �a.

757
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:09,714
S'il vous pla�t,
est-ce que je pourrais avoir le...

758
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:11,930
�a.

759
00:53:12,828 --> 00:53:13,919
Merci.

760
00:53:15,884 --> 00:53:17,447
Identification,
s'il vous plait.

761
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:18,532
What?

762
00:53:20,094 --> 00:53:21,300
- �a.
- Yeah.

763
00:53:23,051 --> 00:53:23,972
Oui.

764
00:53:25,595 --> 00:53:26,605
Merci.

765
00:53:31,284 --> 00:53:32,750
OK, monsieur Marlo.

766
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:38,905
So you string together
Barlow's murder

767
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:43,056
and Cole's unconnected case and yours,
which is natural to begin with...

768
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:46,438
Instant serial killer,
which I thought would get the brass

769
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,603
to begin kicking out some money
to work real cases.

770
00:53:48,763 --> 00:53:49,817
Like Marlo.

771
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,221
Like Marlo.

772
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:57,458
Shit like this actually goes
through your fucking brain?

773
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:01,224
If you don't want listen to me,
then listen to Lester.

774
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:02,803
He has all the wisdom you need.

775
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:05,884
Joke of it is, no one gives
a fuck about a serial killer,

776
00:54:06,044 --> 00:54:08,874
not unless he's carving up
some pretty coed or some shit.

777
00:54:09,317 --> 00:54:11,624
<i>Sunpapers</i> put the story
in their back pages.

778
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:13,157
Eh, you fucked up.

779
00:54:13,372 --> 00:54:14,733
Yeah. Tell him.

780
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,157
No. I mean, if you want to do it right,
a straight-up strangle's not enough.

781
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,386
Not if it's some vagrant.

782
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,475
Sensationalize it.

783
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,703
Give the killer some fucked-up fantasy,

784
00:54:30,863 --> 00:54:33,050
something bad, real bad.

785
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:35,617
It's got to grip the hearts and minds,

786
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:38,123
give the people what they want
from a serial killer.

787
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:40,783
- Lester, what the fuck?
- No. You're onto something.

788
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:44,152
I only need a few weeks
to pull down Marlo Stanfeld.

789
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:46,418
You fly this mess right,
you can give it to me.

790
00:54:47,195 --> 00:54:49,817
Who gives a damn
if we fake a couple murders

791
00:54:49,977 --> 00:54:51,603
