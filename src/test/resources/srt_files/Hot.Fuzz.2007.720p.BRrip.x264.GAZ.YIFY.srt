00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,846
Back off!

Academically excelled in theoretical

Received the Baton of Honor.

00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:38,732
Graduated with distinction into
the Metropolitan Police Service.

11
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:42,861
Quickly established an effectiveness
and popularity within the community.

12
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,404
Use your brain.

13
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,866
Proceeded to improve skill base
with courses in advanced driving

14
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,912
and advanced cycling.

15
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,708
Became heavily involved
in a number of extra vocational activities.

16
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,794
To this day holds the Met record
for the 100 meter dash.

17
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:05,759
In 2001 began active duty with
the renowned SO 19 armed response unit.

18
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:10,222
Received a bravery award for efforts
in the resolution of Operation Crackdown.

19
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:14,267
In the last 12 months
has received nine special commendations.

20
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:17,521
Achieved the highest arrest record
for any officer in the Met.

21
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,190
And sustained three injuries
in the line of duty.

22
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:25,111
Most recently in December when wounded
by a man dressed as Father Christmas.

23
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:32,994
- Hello, Nicholas.
- Hello, Sergeant.

24
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,037
- How's the hand?
- Still a bit stiff.

25
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,080
It can get awfully hairy out there.

26
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:39,459
I'm surprised you weren't snapped up
sooner for a nice desk job. That's what I did.

27
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:41,837
I prefer to think my office is
out on the street.

28
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,463
Indeed, you do.

29
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:48,218
Your arrest record is 400% higher
than any other officer.

30
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,931
Which is why it's high time
that such skills were put to better use.

31
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,269
- We're making you Sergeant.
- I see.

32
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,855
In Sandford, Gloucestershire.

33
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,607
- In where, sorry?
- In Sandford, Gloucestershire.

34
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:05,777
- That's in the country.
- Yes, lovely.

35
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,446
Isn't there a Sergeant's position
here in London?

36
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,739
No.

37
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,117
- Can I remain here as a PC?
- No.

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,619
- Do I have any choice in this?
- No.

39
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,455
Sergeant, I kind of like it here.

40
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,666
Well, you've always wanted
to transfer to the country.

41
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:22,460
- In 20 years or so, yes.
- Well done, you.

42
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,671
Hang on, I don't remember telling you that.

43
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,840
Yes, you did. You said,

44
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:29,926
"I'd love to settle down
in the country sometime, Janine."

45
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:32,971
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.

46
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,015
You can speak to the Inspector,
but I can promise you

47
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,059
he will tell you
exactly the same thing as I have.

48
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,231
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
- It's still a bit stiff.

49
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:45,734
- And how are things at home?
- I'm sorry, sir?

50
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,319
How's Janine?

51
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:50,780
We're no longer together, sir.

52
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,783
- Right. Then where are you living?
- He's staying at the Section House, sir.

53
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,828
- With the recruits?
- Yes, he's living out of cardboard boxes.

54
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:58,788
Well, then, you're packed already.

55
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,833
Nicholas, we're offering you a smashing
position with a delightful cottage,

56
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:05,337
in a lovely little place
that I think has won Village of the Year

57
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,757
I don't know how many times.
It'll be good for you.

58
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:12,427
- I don't really know what to say.
- Yes?

59
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,304
Yes, thank you.

60
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,683
No, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to...

61
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,686
- You want to take this higher?
- Yes, yes, I do.

62
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,688
You want me to bother
the Chief Inspector with this?

63
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:24,856
Yes.

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,984
You want me to get the Chief Inspector
to come all the way down here?

65
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,654
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

66
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,781
Kenneth!

67
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,618
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
- Still a bit stiff.

68
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,662
- Chief Inspector...
- Keep your seat.

69
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,956
Now, I know what you're going to say,

70
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,334
but the fact is,
you've been making us all look bad.

71
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,502
I'm sorry, sir?

72
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,045
Of course we all appreciate your efforts,

73
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:49,714
but you've been rather
letting the side down.

74
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,758
It's all about being a team player, Nicholas.

75
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:53,844
You can't be the Sheriff of London.

76
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,720
If we let you carry on running round town,

77
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:59,641
you'll continue to be exceptional
and we can't have that.

78
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:02,102
You'll put us all out of a job.

79
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:04,187
With respect, sir.

80
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:09,609
- You can't just make people disappear.
- Yes, I can. I'm the Chief Inspector.

81
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:14,906
Well, however you spin this, there's
one thing you haven't taken into account.

82
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,534
And that's what the "team"
is gonna make of this.

83
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,051
- Hello?
- Janine, it's me.

84
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,179
I know. I'm at work.

85
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:39,181
I know, I'm outside.

86
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,726
What's the situation?

87
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,896
You know the situation.
We've been over this.

88
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,397
No, I... I meant here.

89
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,108
Two people involved,
distinct signs of a struggle.

90
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:51,401
Complete mess.

91
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,571
- You are talking about here?
- Nicholas, what do you want?

92
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,825
Well, I have something important to tell you
and I didn't wanna do it over the phone.

93
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,830
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

94
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,081
I'm not Janine.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,044
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

96
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,879
I know. Bob told me.

97
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:12,130
Hello, there.

98
00:06:12,214 --> 00:06:14,299
Well, I wanted to tell you in person.

99
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,510
And there's no reason
we can't be civil with each other.

100
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,428
It's not that long ago
we were talking about getting married.

101
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,431
Yes, but you were already married
to the force, weren't you?

102
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,308
We're actually supposed to call it
"the service" now.

103
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,102
Official vocab guidelines state
that "force" is too aggressive.

104
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,979
See. It's only ever about the job.

105
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:30,273
- It's all you care about.
- That's not true.

106
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,276
No, you're right,
you do have that rubber plant.

107
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,113
- It's a Japanese Peace Lily.
- You just can't switch off, Nicholas.

108
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:43,036
And until you find a person you care
about more than your job, you never will.

109
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:47,082
Besides, you were the one
who suggested we take a break.

110
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:51,169
Yes, well,
guilty people often make the first move.

111
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,381
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

112
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,925
- You're seeing someone else.
- Yes. How did you...

113
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,010
- Is it Bob?
- No.

114
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:02,597
Does Bob look like
the kind of person I'd go out with?

115
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,182
It's Dave.

116
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,725
Hello, there.

117
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,103
I see.

118
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,647
Oh, Nicholas.

119
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,525
You do realize that window
was broken from the inside?

120
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,868
Hello there, Nicholas,
Frank Butterman here, your new Inspector.

121
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:26,163
I'm just calling with details
of your accommodation.

122
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,332
We've got you a lovely little cottage
on Spencer Hill.

123
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,335
Look forward to meeting you anon. Cheerio.

124
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:36,631
Nicholas, Frank again.
One other thing about your cottage.

125
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:38,091
It's not ready.

126
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:23,261
It would appear the heavens have opened.

127
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:34,356
- I was hoping to check in.
- Check in?

128
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:37,192
But you've always been here.

129
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:41,530
- Excuse me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

130
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,365
I thought you were my husband.

131
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:46,159
- You must be Sergeant Angel.
- Yes, I am.

132
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:49,538
I'm Joyce Cooper.
I trust you had a pleasant trip. Fascist.

133
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:51,373
I beg your pardon?

134
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:56,711
"System of Government characterized
by extreme dictatorship." Seven across.

135
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,716
- Oh, I see. It's "fascism."
- Fascism. Wonderful.

136
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:06,388
Now, we've put you in the Castle Suite.
Bernard will escort you up there.

137
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:11,768
Well, actually,
I could probably make my own way up. Hag.

138
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,020
I beg your pardon?

139
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:17,899
"Evil old woman considered
frightful or ugly." It's 12 down.

140
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,652
Oh, bless you.

141
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:09,784
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
- Right you are, my love.

142
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:12,037
Yes, sir, what can I get you?

143
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,042
Could I have a glass
of the cranberry juice, please?

144
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,418
Certainly.

145
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:21,963
Now, you wouldn't, by any chance,
be the new policeman?

146
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,090
Police officer, yes. I'm Nicholas Angel.

147
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:27,052
- I'm Roy Porter. This is my wife Mary.
- Mary.

148
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,845
Welcome to Sandford.

149
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,430
If there's anything you need,
just let us know.

150
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:33,809
Thank you. Could I borrow your newspaper?

151
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:35,143
It's not ours, love.

152
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,813
We're not big fans of the local fish wrapper,
are we, Mare?

153
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:41,483
- They listed her age as 55.
- When I'm actually 53.

154
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:42,818
Fifty-three.

155
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,614
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
- Right you are, my love.

156
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,524
- Excuse me.
- What?

157
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:25,026
- When's your birthday?
- Twenty-second of February.

158
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,112
- What year?
- Every year.

159
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:28,321
Get out.

160
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:34,703
- When's your birthday?
- Eighth of May, 1969.

161
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,580
- You're 37?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,789
Get out.

163
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:38,999
When's your birthday?

164
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,376
Out.

165
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:45,046
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Yes, there is, Mr. Porter.

166
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,924
It would appear a number
of your patrons are under age.

167
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,719
Well, a few of them may be
a month or two south of proper.

168
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:53,555
But if they're in here,
it stops them getting into trouble out there.

169
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,891
Yeah, the way we see it,
it's all for the greater good.

170
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,100
The greater good.

171
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:01,480
Well, that's as may be,
but the law's the law and they'll have to go.

172
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,571
- Another cranberry juice?
- I'm fine, thank you.

173
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,970
I hope you're not planning on driving that.

174
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,305
No.

175
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:54,157
Right. I'm taking you to the station.

176
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,077
Where is it?

177
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,001
What?

178
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,763
Move.

179
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,562
"Nicholas Angel."

180
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:27,190
- Oh, when did you start?
- Tomorrow.

181
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,068
Well, I see you've already arrested
the whole village.

182
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:31,319
Not exactly.

183
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:35,073
- You in for the night?
- Go on, four's free.

184
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:38,535
- Hey, now, I need to speak to him.
- He'll be no use till the morning.

185
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,786
I see.

186
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,873
You really want to process all this lot?

187
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:46,293
- My pen's running out.
- Not a problem.

188
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,042
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning.

189
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,293
Morning.

190
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,504
Morning, Sergeant.

191
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,466
Morning, Sergeant.

192
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,723
- Lock me up.
- I'm sorry?

193
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:43,934
I'm a slasher and I must be stopped.

194
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,480
- You're a what?
- A slasher of prices.

195
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:54,778
Just kidding. I'm Simon Skinner.
I run the local supermarché.

196
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:58,490
Drop in and see me sometime.
My discounts are criminal.

197
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,492
Catch me later!

198
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,788
Morning, Sergeant.

199
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,420
Morning, Sergeant.

200
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,261
Could you tell the Inspector
I've arrived, please?

201
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:20,887
No.

202
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:22,722
Why?

203
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,142
He's not in yet.

204
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,894
- Well, how's our guest?
- Guest?

205
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:32,607
- The inebriate in cell four.
- I don't know. Nobody tells me nothing.

206
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,906
Can I get cell four open, please?

207
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,075
Danny, can you open four?

208
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:49,082
- He's gone.
- Oh, my God. Who's gone?

209
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:56,256
- Why are you dressed like a police officer?
- Because I am one.

210
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:59,551
Sergeant Angel, at last. Frank Butterman.

211
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,805
- I see you've already met my boy.
- Yes.

212
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,060
Do forgive me.
I'm something of a Wild West nut.

213
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:13,482
Speaking of which, that was a fair
few outlaws you rounded up last night.

214
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,233
Thank you, sir.

215
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:20,238
I admire your enthusiasm
and far be it from me to stifle your flair,

216
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:23,033
but this isn't London.
Oh, yes, please, Danny.

217
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,242
With respect, sir,

218
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:27,579
geographical location shouldn't factor
in the application of the law.

219
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:28,955
No, thanks.

220
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,959
Statistically, Sandford is
the safest village in the country.

221
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,253
But that doesn't mean
it requires anything less

222
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:37,798
than a careful and considered approach.

223
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:40,801
There's a reason we accommodate
a few of the younglings at the pub.

224
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:44,387
- The greater good?
- The greater good. Precisely.

225
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:48,767
Your predecessor assumed
that rural policing was easy.

226
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,603
Ended up having a nervous breakdown.

227
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:55,816
And Sergeant Popwell was
an exceptional officer, truly exceptional.

228
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:58,610
And he had one thing you haven't got.

229
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:01,613
- What's that, sir?
- A great big bushy beard.

230
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:03,782
Come on, let's have a mosey around.

231
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,452
Locker room.

232
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,330
Riot room.

233
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,000
Evidence room.

234
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,007
Now, how about a trip to the Andes?

235
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:24,928
Detective Sergeant Wainwright
and Detective Constable Cartwright.

236
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:27,931
Don't get up.

237
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,810
I expect you're wondering
why we call them the Andes.

238
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:35,564
- They're both called Andrew?
- They said you were good.

239
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:38,316
Also, because talking to them is
an uphill struggle, isn't it, Dad?

240
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,735
- Fuck off!
- Thank you, Danny.

241
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:49,911
And this is where it all happens.

242
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,582
That is Sergeant Tony Fisher.

243
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:54,958
PC Bob Walker.

244
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:57,752
And that is Saxon.

245
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:02,507
And this is one Doris Thatcher.

246
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:04,676
- She's our only policewoman.
- She's not a policewoman.

247
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,970
- Yeah, she is. I've seen her bra.
- She's a police officer.

248
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,513
Being a woman has nothing to do with it.

249
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:10,682
Oh, I don't know.
Comes in handy every so often.

250
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:14,519
I could've given you the tour.
I've been round the station a few times.

251
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,313
And what's upstairs?

252
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,650
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

253
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,028
Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.

254
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,823
Civilian liaison
with the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.

255
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:30,035
You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.

256
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:36,791
From this command center
I can see what the whole village is up to.

257
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:41,421
I must say I was rather admiring
your handiwork last night.

258
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:44,090
It's a pity you didn't do the same
to those bloody hoodies.

259
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:46,802
Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.

260
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,304
Actually, I did notice some minor graffiti
on the fountain.

261
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,723
Graffiti? They've gotta be dealt with, Frank.

262
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:54,059
They're nippers, Tom. They'll come round.

263
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,393
Which reminds me,

264
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:58,814
our friend, The Living Statue,
was here on Saturday.

265
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:03,944
11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00.

266
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:06,863
If we don't come down hard
on these clowns,

267
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:11,201
- we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.
- We'll get right onto it, Tom.

268
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:15,872
We like to let them think they run the place.

269
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,707
Well, that's that.

270
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,210
Unless there's anything
you're unclear about?

271
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,505
Yes, sir.
Why is everybody eating chocolate cake?

272
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:27,843
The Black Forest gateau is on Danny.
As punishment for his little indiscretion.

273
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:29,010
His...

274
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:32,430
Sir, I don't think driving under the influence
can be called a "little indiscretion."

275
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:35,684
No, the gateau is for misplacing
his helmet the other week.

276
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:39,729
Last night's incident will require
something rather more serious.

277
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,107
- Good.
- Do you like ice-cream?

278
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,942
I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.

279
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:47,779
Let's just say that we won't be short
of Chunky Monkey for the next month.

280
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:49,614
Dad.

281
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:53,493
Now, since it's your first day
and it's 11:30, I'd say that's lunch.

282
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:04,421
So, what made you choose Sandford then,
Sergeant Angel?

283
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,131
It wasn't actually my choice.

284
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:10,385
Oh, right, right, wasn't your choice to come
down here and tell me how to do my job.

285
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:11,678
Our jobs.

286
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:14,806
Yeah.

287
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:18,685
Look, I can assure you it wasn't
my intention to upset the apple cart.

288
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:22,022
Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here,
don't we?

289
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:24,941
- Your dad sells apples, Andy.
- And raspberries.

290
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,611
I bet you can't wait to jump
into Sergeant Popwell's grave.

291
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,863
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.

292
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:34,493
- You got a mustache.
- I know.

293
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,330
- Why have you got your stab vest on?
- It's a requirement.

294
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:42,667
In the city maybe.
Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.

295
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,961
Not a member of the public anyhow.

296
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,800
- Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?
- No.

297
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:51,301
Well, I have.

298
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,970
And I can assure you
it is not in the least bit amusing.

299
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:58,183
Have you seen a lot of action,
Sergeant Angel?

300
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,185
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

301
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:02,771
- Did you cook any fools?
- Excuse me?

302
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:04,105
Did you shoot anybody?

303
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:07,526
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.

304
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:11,822
- Where did you get that?
- The offender had the Kalashnikov.

305
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:12,989
Where'd he get that?

306
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:16,284
You do know there are more guns
in the country than there are in the city?

307
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:19,412
Everybody and their mums
is packing round here.

308
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:22,207
- Like who?
- Farmers.

309
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,793
- Who else?
- Farmers's mums.

310
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,883
What's it like being stabbed?

311
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:35,846
It was the single most painful
experience of my life.

312
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:38,306
What was the second most painful?

313
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:45,814
You ever fired two guns
whilst jumping through the air?

314
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,857
No.

315
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:47,899
You ever fired one gun
whilst jumping through the air?

316
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:48,942
No.

317
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:49,985
- Ever been in a high speed pursuit?
- Yes, I have.

318
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,027
You ever fired a gun
whilst in a high speed pursuit?

319
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:52,821
No.

320
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:57,617
Annette,
that Sergeant Angel's coming into your shop.

321
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:59,369
Get a look at his arse.

322
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:02,247
- What about Lethal Weapon?
- No.

323
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,332
- You've seen Die Hard, though?
- No.

324
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,042
- Bad Boys II?
- No.

325
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:07,836
You ain't seen Bad Boys II?

326
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,717
- Hell of a day, huh?
- Yeah.

327
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,385
- Same again tomorrow?
- Yeah.

328
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:24,436
Amanda Paver,
headmistress of Sandford Primary.

329
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,937
How do you do, Sergeant?

330
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:30,859
- Simon Skinner, I believe you've met.
- Oh, we're already firm friends.

331
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,944
Oh, please, please, come with me, will you?

332
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,905
This is Leslie Tiller,

333
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:39,326
whose horticultural expertise
has helped put Sandford on the map.

334
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:41,912
- She's ever so good.
- Oh, go on.

335
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:44,414
This is James Reaper,
who owns Brannigan Farm.

336
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:46,208
I hear you're quite the marksman.

337
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,752
Perhaps you might like to join us
for a shoot one day.

338
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,379
Well, I haven't held a firearm
for over two years, Mr. Reaper.

339
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,089
I'd quite like to keep it that way.

340
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:54,925
You will be popular with the local birds.

341
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,718
Birds.

342
00:22:57,469 --> 00:23:00,013
Nicholas, hello. Reverend Shooter.

343
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:03,767
I want to ask you,
would you read a homily at Sunday Service?

344
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,936
That might be
a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.

345
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,271
Oh, you're an atheist?

346
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:09,815
No, I'm... I'm...

347
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:12,943
I'm open to the concept of religion,
I'm just not entirely convinced by it.

348
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:15,654
- You're an agnostic?
- I think I have a cream for that.

349
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:20,951
Robin Hatcher, our resident sawbones.

350
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:23,954
Hopefully we won't see too much
of each other over the coming months.

351
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,790
Well, all that remains is to welcome you

352
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:31,461
to the weekly meeting
of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.

353
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:36,883
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

354
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,679
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

355
00:23:41,012 --> 00:23:43,056
So, congratulations to her.

356
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,433
- Tom?
- Thanks, Joyce.

357
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,102
Now.

358
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:52,816
I am sure that all of you will have noticed
the return of a blight to our streets.

359
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,237
It's made all the more disturbing as
the Village of the Year contest looms.

360
00:23:57,988 --> 00:24:03,118
I refer, of course,
to the extremely irritating Living Statue.

361
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:11,793
Police work
is as much about preventing crime

362
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:13,712
as it is about fighting crime.

363
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:17,299
Most importantly,
it is about procedural correctness

364
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:20,802
in the execution
of unquestionable moral authority.

365
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,305
Any questions?

366
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,892
Yes.

367
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:29,686
Is it true that there is a place
in a man's head

368
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,897
that if you shoot it, it will blow up?

369
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:37,277
Hi, hi, Tim Messenger.

370
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,654
Can I get a quick shot
for the Sandford Citizen?

371
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:40,906
Okay.

372
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:43,116
How about you put the teacher
in handcuffs?

373
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,701
I don't think that gives off the right signals.

374
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,661
Too cheesy-pie. Okay. Gotcha.

375
00:24:47,078 --> 00:24:49,164
- Give the little blonde kid your hat.
- I'd rather not.

376
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,541
- Wave your hitting stick about.
- No.

377
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,876
Righty-ho-ho.

378
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,383
Oh, can I have your autograph, please?

379
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:05,430
- For the breakfast.
- Oh, sorry.

380
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:12,562
Hey, that weren't me.

381
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:16,399
- Morning, Angle.
- Good morning, Angle.

382
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,735
- Morning, Angle.
- Morning, Angle.

383
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,321
- Sergeant Angel.
- Morning. The swan's escaped.

384
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:22,864
- The swan's escaped?
- Yeah.

385
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:25,158
Right. And where has the swan
escaped from exactly?

386
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:27,160
- The castle.
- Oh, yeah? And who might you be?

387
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:30,580
Mr. Staker. Yeah, Mr. Peter Ian Staker.

388
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:33,750
P.I. Staker. Right. Piss taker. Come on!

389
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:37,754
Yes, Mr. Staker. We'll do everything we can.
Can you describe it to me?

390
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:39,714
It's about two foot tall.

391
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,259
- Long slender neck.
- Yeah.

392
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:45,220
- Kind of orange and black bill.
- Anything else?

393
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:47,722
Well, it's a swan.

394
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,023
That's just gonna scare it.

395
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:07,200
- No luck catching them swans then?
- It's just the one swan, actually.

396
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:13,582
- Want anything from the shop?
- You've just been to the shop.

397
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,709
I was thinking of a different shop.

398
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:18,378
Constable Butterman,
this is not the time for personal errands.

399
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:22,090
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?
- There is always something going on.

400
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:26,094
You have to look closer, all right?
What about this guy?

401
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:28,138
- Mr. Treacher?
- Yeah.

402
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,307
Why has he got that big coat on?

403
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,227
He can't be cold. Why the extra layer?
Maybe he's trying to hide something.

404
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:36,271
Mr. Treacher?

405
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,565
Okay. What about this guy?

406
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,109
Ask yourself, why has he got his hat
pulled down like that?

407
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:44,488
- He's fuck ugly.
- Or he doesn't want you to see his face.

408
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:46,615
Because he's fuck ugly.

409
00:26:47,032 --> 00:26:48,783
Okay, what's his story?

410
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,327
- Oh, that's Lurch.
- Go on.

411
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,704
- He's a trolley boy at the local supermarket.
- Good.

412
00:26:52,787 --> 00:26:54,623
Real name, Michael Armstrong.

413
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:56,917
- Dad says he's got a child's mind.
- Okay.

414
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,127
And lives up Summer Street
with his mum and his sister.

415
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:00,462
And are they as big as he is?

416
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:03,173
- Who?
- The mum and the sister.

417
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,758
Same person.

418
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:07,511
What shop were you thinking of?

419
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:32,994
Sergeant Angel to the Manager's office.

420
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:36,164
Manager's office. Sergeant Angel.

421
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:43,046
Sergeant Angel. Or is it Angle?

422
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:47,801
Mr. Skinner, a baby's sicked up in aisle six.

423
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:51,263
Please excuse me. Michael!

424
00:27:51,346 --> 00:27:52,514
Yarp.

425
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:56,059
- Child vomit. Aisle six. Mop it up.
- Yarp.

426
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:59,354
- Mr. Skinner, is there a problem?
- No, no, no, no.

427
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:03,692
I simply wanted to say how lovely it is
to see you supporting your local store.

428
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:05,026
Well, that's quite all right.

429
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,364
All too many have defected
to the big Megamart in Buford Abbey.

430
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:13,910
May their heads be struck
from their shoulders for such disloyalty.

431
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:17,038
Yes, well, I am on duty,
so if you'll excuse me.

432
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:20,625
Of course. I simply spied you loitering
in organic produce

433
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:23,336
and assumed you had time on your hands.

434
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,217
Well, maybe I'm not the one
you should be keeping an eye on.

435
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:32,554
That's the Fridge Magnate.
His name's George Merchant.

436
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:36,892
Made a fortune in kitchen goods.
Built that monstrosity on Norris Avenue.

437
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,103
Actually, I wasn't talking about him.

438
00:28:40,812 --> 00:28:43,565
I was talking about him.

439
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:46,109
Excuse me.

440
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:52,908
Excuse me.

441
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:05,921
"Meet the cop that can't be stopped."

442
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,189
Tosser!

443
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,776
Trouble in the high street.

444
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,528
Sergeant Angel's having a spot of bother.

445
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:30,821
Roger that.

446
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:42,499
Morning, Sergeant.

447
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,091
You mothers.

448
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:59,599
- Let's cut through here. Head him off.
- Through the gardens?

449
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:02,310
What's the matter, Danny?
You never taken a shortcut before.

450
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,315
Hey, give me that!

451
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:56,823
"You do not have to say anything,
however it may harm your defense

452
00:30:56,907 --> 00:30:59,618
"if you fail to mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

453
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:01,786
"Anything you do say
can be given in evidence."

454
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,538
- Hi, Danny.
- All right, Pete?

455
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:04,748
Do you know this man?

456
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:06,541
Yeah, he's Auntie Jackie's
sister's brother's boy.

457
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,502
And it didn't occur to you
to mention this before?

458
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:11,421
Couldn't see his face, could I?
I'm not made of eyes.

459
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:23,850
Impressive collar.

460
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:26,478
Shame Mr. Skinner
doesn't want to press charges.

461
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,021
What do you mean,
he doesn't wanna press charges?

462
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:31,942
I'm simply suggesting that, you know,
Peter be given a second chance

463
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,986
before he becomes
just another crime statistic.

464
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,906
I'm sure he's going to learn
a valuable lesson.

465
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:41,701
- Stealing biscuits is wrong?
- Correct.

466
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:42,869
Thanks.

467
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:45,831
And yet we respond by not taking
a single punitive measure?

468
00:31:45,914 --> 00:31:48,875
Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

469
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,877
Like the biscuits, isn't it?

470
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:53,839
- Mr. Skinner...
- Is everything all right?

471
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:58,969
Well, sir, Mr. Skinner feels it would
be better not to prosecute an individual

472
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,138
that has committed a blatant offense.

473
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:02,681
Leave this with me.

474
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:05,934
I'll make sure everyone gets
their just deserts.

475
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:07,894
Oh, no!

476
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,232
Twenty-seven.

477
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:15,861
- Have you ever seen Point Break?
- No.

478
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:18,280
Amazing bit in Point Break
where they jump over fences.

479
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:20,282
Is there now? Twenty-nine.

480
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:23,326
Patrick Swayze's just robbed this bank
and Keanu Reeves is chasing him

481
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,329
through people's gardens,
and he goes to shoot Swayze but he can't,

482
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:27,581
'cause he loves him so much,

483
00:32:27,664 --> 00:32:29,833
and he's firing his gun up in the air,
he's like...

484
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,334
Forty.

485
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:33,211
Have you ever fired your gun up
in the air and gone...

486
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:36,631
No, I have not ever fired my gun
up in the air and gone...

487
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:38,175
Thirty.

488
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:41,970
Sorry, I... I just...
I just feel like I'm missing out sometimes.

489
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:45,056
- I wanna do what you do.
- You do, do what I do.

490
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,933
What on earth
do you think you're missing out on?

491
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:50,479
Gun fights. Car chases.
Proper action and shit.

492
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:53,982
Police work is not about
proper action or shit.

493
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:56,193
Twenty-nine.

494
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:57,611
If you had paid attention to me in school,

495
00:32:57,694 --> 00:33:00,864
you'd understand that it's not all about
gun fights and car chases.

496
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:03,617
Fire up the roof.

497
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:09,956
That was brilliant.

498
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,170
Was I going a tad fast, Officer?

499
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,756
Yes, you were, Mr. Blower.

500
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,092
Well, now, you see,
we are staging a homage

501
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:25,263
to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
and I'm a little late for the dress rehearsal.

502
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:28,391
I'm playing the eponymous hero, you see.

503
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,268
Romeo not Juliet.

504
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:35,357
- What are you writing?
- Everything you're saying.

505
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,858
I might need to refer to it later.

506
00:33:36,942 --> 00:33:41,029
Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor
so there's no need to...

507
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:42,656
Just stop writing, will you?

508
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:47,953
Look, I'm merely trying to explain
why I might have exceeded the speed limit.

509
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:50,831
You're playing the male lead
in a homage to William Shakespeare's

510
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:53,834
Romeo and Juliet
and you're late for the dress rehearsal.

511
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:56,795
You think this is sufficient reason
to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?

512
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:58,713
- Well, I...
- To flout speed limits

513
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:02,843
- specifically put in place to save lives.
- Just, look, this is preposterous.

514
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:06,721
- "Preposterous."
- Look, just stop writing!

515
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:08,974
"Stop writing."

516
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:14,729
Look, you're right, I apologize.

517
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:18,483
- See what I did there?
- You hypnotized him.

518
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,985
No, I used this.

519
00:34:20,068 --> 00:34:22,571
This is the most important piece
of equipment you will ever own.

520
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:25,532
This notebook has saved my skin
more times than I care to mention.

521
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:27,159
You should think
about using yours more often.

522
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:29,244
- I do use mine.
- Show me.

523
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:37,794
- That's just extraordinary.
- You should see the one on the other side.

524
00:34:43,842 --> 00:34:46,845
- What are you up to tonight?
- I have to water my Peace Lily.

525
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:48,472
Thought you might wanna do something.

526
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:51,683
- What exactly were you thinking?
- Don't know. Pub?

527
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,020
I don't think that's a good idea. Do you?

528
00:34:58,023 --> 00:34:59,524
You two.

529
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:04,070
A Mr. Blower left you tickets
for Romeo and Juliet tonight.

530
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:05,530
Said it was by way of an apology.

531
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:07,157
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

532
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:11,620
Well, we can't accept gifts from somebody
we've officially rebuked. So...

533
00:35:12,078 --> 00:35:13,288
Yeah.

534
00:35:14,623 --> 00:35:16,208
Nicholas. Glad I caught you.

535
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:20,045
Wondered if you wouldn't mind
representing us at the am drams tonight.

536
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:23,048
- Yes, sir, of course.
- And there's a spare for Danny, too.

537
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:26,551
Yeah! Hey, come on, it might be fun.

538
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,184
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

539
00:35:34,226 --> 00:35:36,937
Here's to my love.

540
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:44,986
Now.

541
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:53,328
Poison? I'll kiss thy lips.

542
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:57,332
Happily some poison
doth yet hang on them.

543
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:06,174
Bang!

544
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:28,280
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
Quick word for the Sandford Citizen.

545
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:30,240
It was very enjoyable.

546
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:32,576
- "Cop Enjoys Watching Young Lovers"?
- I don't think so.

547
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,286
"Local Bobby Gives Thumbs Up
To Teen Suicide"?

548
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:35,954
That's just grossly inappropriate.

549
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:40,041
You will try and spell his name
correctly this time, won't you, Timothy?

550
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,586
Absolute tosh, wasn't it?

551
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:46,965
And annoyingly, the understudies
are actually professional actors.

552
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:49,593
Greg over there was an extra in Straw Dogs

553
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:51,553
and Sheree portrayed a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.

554
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:53,805
Sergeant Angel, you came?

555
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:57,267
So thrilled you accepted my invitation.

556
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,312
Well, our Inspector
requested we attend. So...

557
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:05,192
Yeah, we can't accept gifts from
someone we've officially rebuked so...

558
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:06,610
Jog on.

559
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:10,489
Congratulations to you and to Mrs. Blower.

560
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:17,537
Oh, this is not my wife.
This is Miss Draper. My leading lady.

561
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:22,334
Eve works in the local council, Sergeant.
Quite the lady in the know.

562
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,337
- I am not.
- Nonsense.

563
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:31,134
I'm sure if we bashed your head in, all sorts
of secrets would come tumbling out.

564
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:37,599
Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for Romeo?

565
00:37:37,682 --> 00:37:39,559
Thank you very much for coming, George.
Excuse us.

566
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:41,770
A pleasure, my liege.

567
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:45,273
- Eve's nice, ain't she?
- She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

568
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:48,777
She was in my year at school.
Always had a thing for her.

569
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:51,530
She clearly has a thing for older men.

570
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:54,950
What, with Martin Blower? No way!

571
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,120
We just sat through three hours
of so-called acting, Constable,

572
00:37:58,203 --> 00:38:00,956
their kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

573
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,707
Hey, now you come to mention it,

574
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,418
I too have reason to believe
she favors the older gent.

575
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:06,628
Really? How so?

576
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:09,798
Marcus Carter's big brother said
he'd fingered her up the duck pond.

577
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:14,970
Oh, Officers.

578
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:18,682
Again let me extend
my sincere apologies for earlier.

579
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:22,144
That's quite all right, Mr. Blower. Drive safe.

580
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:30,527
"Drive safe." Oh, my God.

581
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,988
You know that's the bloke
we done for speeding earlier.

582
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:35,991
Yeah. Hopefully,
that's the last we'll see of him.

583
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:49,671
Who is it?

584
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:55,385
We haven't got long.

585
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:58,555
To us.

586
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:02,017
Who is it?

587
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:15,238
Yeah?

588
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,951
- ...decaffeinated?
- Decaffeinated?

589
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:27,626
Little Brian Libby found them,
out on his paper round.

590
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:31,254
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.

591
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:35,634
Must have hit the sign at some speed.
Took the whole top off.

592
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:38,762
- I've had my top off in this lay-by.
- Tits.

593
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:45,393
Most likely lost control,
left the road there and then ended up here.

594
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:51,399
So, what do we reckon?

595
00:39:52,192 --> 00:39:53,652
Sergeant Angel?

596
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:57,072
Well, we should get a proper cordon off,
screen the remains from public view.

597
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:58,865
Close down the road
until the ambulance crew arrives,

598
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:02,285
whereupon we should open
a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

599
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:04,162
Very good.

600
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,914
What he said.

601
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:13,421
- What happened, Danny?
- Car accident.

602
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:15,257
Nasty way to go.

603
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:18,093
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

604
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,263
we no longer refer to these incidents
as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

605
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:22,430
Right.

606
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:28,645
"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

607
00:40:28,937 --> 00:40:32,607
- Excuse me?
- Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

608
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:34,276
Mr. Skinner, do you mind telling me

609
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:36,570
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

610
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:40,115
You know how it is. News travels fast.

611
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:44,453
A love struck Romeo
sings a streetsus serenade

612
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:47,456
- What happened, Danny?
- Traffic collision.

613
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,625
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

614
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,170
Because "accident" implies
there's nobody to blame.

615
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:56,089
Put a sock in it, town mouse.

616
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:59,926
Yeah, you wanna be a big cop in
a small town, fuck off up the model village.

617
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,429
I'm just saying,
things aren't always as simple as they look.

618
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:04,347
Most times they are.

619
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:07,184
Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher
comes back with something,

620
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,853
before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.

621
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:13,064
All right, in the meantime, why don't you
check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

622
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:16,026
Martin Blower represents
damn near most of the village.

623
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:17,652
Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

624
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:20,530
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,
shall we?

625
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:21,948
Please, don't be childish.

626
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:23,325
At least consider interviewing the widow.

627
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:25,494
Martin Blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve Draper.

628
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:28,997
Oh, and how did you establish that?

629
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,833
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

630
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:34,336
and the kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

631
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:36,505
All right, pipe down, big one.

632
00:41:36,588 --> 00:41:39,132
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and Tubby?

633
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:41,635
- Skid marks.
- Now who's being childish?

634
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:43,553
There were no skid marks at the scene.

635
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:46,598
Doesn't it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car

636
00:41:46,681 --> 00:41:48,600
and not think to apply the brakes?

637
00:41:49,226 --> 00:41:50,519
If there were no skid marks it follows

638
00:41:50,602 --> 00:41:54,523
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger
did nothing to prevent their fate.

639
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:56,608
You don't have to be a detective
to work that out!

640
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,859
Yeah.

641
00:41:57,943 --> 00:42:01,029
- Are you causing trouble?
- Yes, they are.

642
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:04,324
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

643
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:07,911
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

644
00:42:07,994 --> 00:42:09,704
- Yes, sir?
- That's it.

645
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:11,832
Yes, sir.

646
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:21,133
- Why do we need the dog?
- It's not the dog we need.

647
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,975
Right.

648
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:31,184
What did he say?

649
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:38,733
- What did he say?
- He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.

650
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,402
"He only chopped it down
'cause it spoilt his view.

651
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:41,903
"What's Reaper moaning about?"

652
00:42:41,987 --> 00:42:43,071
Right.

653
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:44,489
Look, I appreciate your position,
Mr. Webley,

654
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:47,742
but you can't go around chopping down
other people's hedges without permission.

655
00:42:49,786 --> 00:42:51,121
"Yes, I suppose."

656
00:42:51,204 --> 00:42:52,330
Thank you.

657
00:42:53,081 --> 00:42:54,583
All right.

658
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:59,087
Mr. Webley,
I trust you have a license for that firearm?

659
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:03,049
He does for this one.

660
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:06,261
What do you mean by "this one"?

661
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:22,527
By the power of Grey Skull.

662
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:24,571
Where on earth did you get these?

663
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:26,573
- Found them.
- He found them!

664
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:30,243
- And what is this?
- Sea mine.

665
00:43:30,327 --> 00:43:31,870
Sea mine.

666
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,664
Well, Mr. Webley,
this is an extremely dangerous collection.

667
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,249
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

668
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,335
No, it's just a lot of junk.

669
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:52,599
Move, move, move!

670
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:16,456
- You what?
- No, apparently it's been deactivated. Over.

671
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,625
That's right, deactivated!

672
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,627
- It's not live.
- It looks live.

673
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,795
All right.

674
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:47,154
That was quite an impressive haul today,
Constable Butterman.

675
00:44:47,237 --> 00:44:50,657
Well, you know, I mean, maybe
we should do something to celebrate.

676
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,159
Unless you gotta water your Peace Lily.

677
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:55,662
- What exactly did you have in mind?
- I don't know. Pub?

678
00:45:01,334 --> 00:45:02,961
Right you are, my love.

679
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:05,130
Yes, sirs, what can I get you?

680
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:06,798
Pint of lager, please, Roy.

681
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:08,508
And what can I get you
that isn't a cranberry juice?

682
00:45:08,592 --> 00:45:11,219
- I don't really wanna get drunk.
- You can get a little drunk.

683
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:14,014
- Okay, I'll have one.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

684
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:16,349
Mr. Porter, what's your wine selection?

685
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:21,062
Oh, we got red or white.

686
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:25,442
- I'll have a pint of lager, please.
- Yeah, Roy.

687
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:34,785
- Any news from earlier?
- Yeah. CSI found nothing.

688
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:39,372
Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure
and Mrs. Blower has four alibis.

689
00:45:39,456 --> 00:45:45,378
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job
to investigate this incident, is it?

690
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:47,339
Is it?

691
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:49,883
- No, it isn't.
- No, it isn't.

692
00:45:52,427 --> 00:45:55,680
- You don't switch off, do you?
- You sound like my ex.

693
00:45:56,306 --> 00:45:59,851
- Well, you are always thinking away.
- It's what I do.

694
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,355
- Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.
- Really?

695
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:06,066
I mean,
what made you wanna be a policeman?

696
00:46:06,149 --> 00:46:07,234
Officer.

697
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:09,903
What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

698
00:46:12,447 --> 00:46:15,867
I don't remember a time
when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

699
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:19,704
Apart from the summer of 1979
when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

700
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:24,709
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.

701
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:27,712
He bought me a police pedal car
when I was five.

702
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:29,923
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

703
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:33,385
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

704
00:46:33,468 --> 00:46:36,555
I got beaten up a lot when I was young
but it didn't stop me.

705
00:46:36,638 --> 00:46:38,557
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

706
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,724
He sounds like a good bloke.

707
00:46:39,808 --> 00:46:42,144
Actually, he was arrested
for selling drugs to students.

708
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:43,353
What a cunt.

709
00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:45,856
Probably bought the pedal car
with the proceeds.

710
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:49,234
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.

711
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:51,361
But I never forgot
the clear sense of right and wrong

712
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:53,446
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

713
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,158
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

714
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:58,618
and righteous
and for the good of humankind.

715
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:02,330
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.

716
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,958
- Shame.
- How so?

717
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:07,586
I think you would've made a great muppet.

718
00:47:11,214 --> 00:47:14,092
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

719
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:17,596
I don't know. Dad does it.

720
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,850
I think after my mum died, it's what
he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

721
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:25,937
- Do you mind if I ask how she died?
- Traffic collision.

722
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,106
I'm sorry.

723
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:31,485
Never mind. Hey, watch this.

724
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,238
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my eye!

725
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:38,074
Ta-da!

726
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:39,993
Hey, come on, silly bollocks, get them in.

727
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:55,133
- 777.
- Mr. Skinner.

728
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:57,803
- You know George Merchant, don't you?
- Evening, Officer.

729
00:47:57,886 --> 00:48:00,806
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.

730
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:04,309
I'd come to know Martin
and Eve very well of late.

731
00:48:04,392 --> 00:48:05,936
Such a loss.

732
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,480
What say we drink to their demise?

733
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:10,106
Shouldn't that be "drink to their memories"?

734
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,442
Of course. Cheers.

735
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:14,361
I must go to the little boys' room.

736
00:48:15,737 --> 00:48:18,490
- I'm all right!
- "Little" being the operative word.

737
00:48:19,074 --> 00:48:21,660
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.

738
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,130
I think somebody needs to go home.

739
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:37,008
- I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.
- Not you. Him.

740
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:40,428
What?

741
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,559
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did you get it?

742
00:48:45,642 --> 00:48:48,353
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.

743
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,107
Oh, good grief.

744
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,402
It's hardly in keeping
with the village's rustic esthetic, is it?

745
00:48:57,279 --> 00:48:59,781
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty quid.

746
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:01,867
There you go.

747
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,578
- And there's your change.
- God bless you.

748
00:49:05,245 --> 00:49:06,496
Bye-bye.

749
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,126
I'm all right.

750
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:16,214
I would not wanna be him in the morning.

751
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,187
Well, this is me.

752
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,524
Well, I shall see you in the morning.

753
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:37,486
Unless you wanna come in
for a cup of coffee?

754
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:40,238
- I don't drink coffee.
- Tea?

755
00:49:40,322 --> 00:49:42,365
No caffeine after midday.

756
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:44,993
How about another beer?

757
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:53,877
Oh, dear.

758
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:03,553
- When did you move in?
- About five years ago.

759
00:50:04,763 --> 00:50:07,474
- You should get some house plants.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

760
00:50:07,557 --> 00:50:10,393
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily
for about three years now.

761
00:50:11,978 --> 00:50:15,524
It oxygenates the room,
helps you think, relieves stress.

762
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:17,442
Its needs are simple.

763
00:50:21,738 --> 00:50:24,908
Janine used to say I love my Lily
more than I loved her.

764
00:50:24,991 --> 00:50:27,244
- Is that why you split up?
- What?

765
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:31,581
- 'Cause you did it with a plant?
- No, no, no.

766
00:50:31,665 --> 00:50:35,210
It was more about me being
obsessed with the job.

767
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:37,838
That's good though, right?

768
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:39,798
Is it though?

769
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:45,178
I did miss a few dinners.
You know, parties, a birthday or two.

770
00:50:45,262 --> 00:50:48,306
- Listen, mate, I...
- Her dad's funeral.

771
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:53,854
- I just wanna be good at what I do.
- You are good at what you do.

772
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:59,776
You've just gotta learn to switch off
that big old melon of yours.

773
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,905
That's the whole problem, Danny.

774
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:09,286
I don't think I know how.

775
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:12,205
I can show you how.

776
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:20,881
By the power of Grey Skull.

777
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:24,050
Point Break or Bad Boys II?

778
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:25,469
Which one do you think I'll prefer?

779
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:27,679
No, I mean which one
do you wanna watch first?

780
00:51:27,762 --> 00:51:28,972
You are pulling my leg?

781
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:12,015
What did you think of that?

782
00:52:12,098 --> 00:52:14,893
Well, I won't argue
that it was a no holds barred,

783
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:18,021
adrenalin fueled thrill ride
but there's no way you could perpetrate

784
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:22,359
that amount of carnage and mayhem and not
incur a considerable amount of paperwork.

785
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:23,777
That is nothing, man.

786
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,529
This is about to go off.

787
00:52:41,628 --> 00:52:43,213
This shit just got real.

788
00:52:47,092 --> 00:52:48,844
Nasty way to go.

789
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:52,931
I think our Mr. Merchant tried to have
a little fry up and left the gas on.

790
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:57,936
Spends his whole life
devoted to the refrigerator

791
00:52:58,186 --> 00:53:00,564
then gets killed by an oven.

792
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:04,860
I told him several times,
you shouldn't eat late at night.

793
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:07,863
Oh, I don't know.
I quite like a little midnight gobble.

794
00:53:07,946 --> 00:53:09,156
Cocks.

795
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:12,909
So, what do we reckon? Angel?

796
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:15,370
Help me.

797
00:53:15,912 --> 00:53:19,458
Okay, we get a proper cordon up,
we let the fire crews finish their stuff,

798
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:22,294
and then we get forensics in
to do a thorough sweep of the house.

799
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:25,088
Very good. What he said.

800
00:53:25,172 --> 00:53:27,299
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. A quick word?

801
00:53:27,382 --> 00:53:29,718
Mr. Messenger,
a statement will be issued shortly.

802
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:32,471
Actually, I just wanted to ask,
"What's your perfect Sunday?"

803
00:53:32,554 --> 00:53:34,931
I'll deal with the press, Sergeant.

804
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:39,978
Now, my perfect Sunday
is a lovely long lie in...

805
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:45,275
Fire to destroy all you've done

806
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:50,781
Like in the films.

807
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:53,950
Something like,
something out of Backdraft.

808
00:53:55,786 --> 00:53:59,080
- What are you thinking? Foul play?
- Maybe.

809
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:03,084
We're just hoping to talk to the last people
to see Mr. Merchant alive.

810
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:08,590
Namely a Sergeant Knickerless Asswipe
and a Constable Fanny Batterbum.

811
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:11,593
- That's us.
- Why is this such a big joke to you?

812
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:13,136
Three people have died in a week.

813
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,847
Oh, come on, Doctor Sherlock,
they were accidents.

814
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:17,432
People have accidents every day.

815
00:54:17,516 --> 00:54:20,435
- The victims knew each other.
- Everyone knows everyone round here.

816
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:23,772
Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious,
then who did?

817
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:31,029
It's a bit of a blind spot, I'm afraid.

818
00:54:31,113 --> 00:54:33,365
We just catch the very edge
of the explosion.

819
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,283
Nasty way to go.

820
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:37,953
- There was something took my eye.
- Really? What's that?

821
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:40,997
Sandford's most wanted.

822
00:54:42,874 --> 00:54:45,252
There you go. It was the swan all along.

823
00:54:45,335 --> 00:54:48,630
- This is not funny, Detective!
- Oh, give over, Miss Marples.

824
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:51,133
Yeah, you do your job
and we'll do ours, eh?

825
00:54:51,216 --> 00:54:53,468
Yeah. Haven't you got
a church fete to look after?

826
00:54:53,552 --> 00:54:55,512
No, I have not!

827
00:54:56,471 --> 00:54:57,639
Actually.

828
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:04,688
Testing. Testing.

829
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:05,730
Someone's in for a surprise at 3:00,
ladies and gentlemen.

830
00:55:05,772 --> 00:55:07,816
It's the raffle with
a very special guest presenter.

831
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:10,485
Out in the country

832
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:14,656
Far from all the sorts of noise of the city

833
00:55:14,823 --> 00:55:17,325
There's a village green

834
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:21,288
It's been a long time since I last set eyes

835
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:23,498
On the church with a steeple

836
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:25,792
That's me after a couple of pints.

837
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:27,335
Splat the rat.

838
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:31,715
Splat the rat.

839
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,844
Splat the rat.

840
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:39,514
Shark!

841
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:43,310
Seen any murderings, Nicholarse?

842
00:55:43,393 --> 00:55:46,021
Come on, boys.
Leave Sergeant Angel alone, he's working.

843
00:55:46,104 --> 00:55:49,566
Sorry, Chief,
won't waste any more police time.

844
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:50,859
Have a nice time.

845
00:55:50,942 --> 00:55:53,361
Actually, Nicholas,
you might as well take a break.

846
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:56,239
Hey, great. I've got something to show you.

847
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:05,165
- This is a rifle range.
- You'll be really good at it.

848
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:07,709
Feeling lucky, Sergeant?

849
00:56:08,543 --> 00:56:13,173
Three cans wins you the squeaky bunny,
five cans gets you the floppy lion.

850
00:56:13,256 --> 00:56:18,345
Take out all the little people,
you get to waltz off with the cuddly monkey.

851
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:22,891
I thought I made it clear to you
how I feel about firearms.

852
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:25,310
It's only an air rifle.

853
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:26,770
Sergeant.

854
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:47,124
Dear Lord!

855
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,585
That was amazing.

856
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:57,968
- Thank you, Danny.
- I can't believe I shot someone.

857
00:56:58,051 --> 00:57:01,304
- He's a doctor, he can deal with it.
- I never shot anyone before.

858
00:57:01,388 --> 00:57:03,598
Danny, believe me,
it's not something you ever get used to.

859
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:05,934
Yeah. Maybe we should
go on the bouncy castle.

860
00:57:06,017 --> 00:57:07,102
Take our minds off of it.

861
00:57:07,185 --> 00:57:09,104
- Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
- Mr. Messenger.

862
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:11,815
I need to talk to you
about George Merchant. Alone.

863
00:57:12,274 --> 00:57:14,526
Churchyard. 3:00.

864
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:17,320
What do you think he wants?

865
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:20,449
Would
Sergeant Angel come to the stage, please?

866
00:57:23,493 --> 00:57:27,456
Here to announce the winners is the newest
addition to the Sandford Police Force.

867
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:28,665
Service.

868
00:57:28,748 --> 00:57:30,500
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.

869
00:57:33,044 --> 00:57:34,337
- Prick.
- Wanker.

870
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,799
Hello. Hello.

871
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:59,488
The first name is Simon Skinner.

872
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:04,034
He's in the loo.

873
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:07,162
Too much of Joyce's lemonade, perhaps.

874
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:31,937
And the next name is...

875
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:49,663
Tim, your number's up.

876
00:58:58,713 --> 00:59:00,340
Excuse me. Excuse me.

877
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:04,052
Hi-hi.

878
00:59:08,557 --> 00:59:09,850
Oh, no!

879
00:59:15,188 --> 00:59:18,108
Stand back, stand back!
There's been a terrible accident.

880
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:20,902
- Accident?
- Just an accident.

881
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:24,281
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.

882
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:28,201
Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.

883
00:59:36,918 --> 00:59:38,545
Nicholas, what is it?

884
00:59:38,628 --> 00:59:42,674
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.

885
00:59:43,091 --> 00:59:46,261
- Who could do something like this?
- Maybe it was the swan.

886
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:49,431
- Apparently, they can break a man's arm.
- Or blow up a man's house.

887
00:59:49,514 --> 00:59:52,476
- Listen, you pair of...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.

888
00:59:52,976 --> 00:59:55,312
Now, let me get this straight.

889
00:59:56,313 --> 01:00:00,317
- Are you saying that this is a crime scene?
- Yes, sir, I am.

890
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,777
Very well.

891
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,403
- Detectives.
- Sir.

892
01:00:03,487 --> 01:00:05,071
Start interviewing everyone
who was at the fete.

893
01:00:05,155 --> 01:00:06,239
Oh, he's got shorts on.

894
01:00:06,323 --> 01:00:07,449
- Sergeant Fisher?
- What?

895
01:00:07,532 --> 01:00:08,950
- Secure the area.
- What?

896
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:10,243
- PC Thatcher?
- Yes, love?

897
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:11,953
Get the CSI down here.

898
01:00:12,037 --> 01:00:13,246
PC Walker?

899
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,624
Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.

900
01:00:15,707 --> 01:00:18,919
Nicholas, Danny, you know what to do.

901
01:00:25,217 --> 01:00:27,385
Do you really think this is murder?

902
01:00:27,552 --> 01:00:29,137
I just don't think we should rule it out,
that's all.

903
01:00:29,221 --> 01:00:30,722
Yeah. I think you're right.

904
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:33,058
I think you're talking a load of old shit.

905
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:37,020
He thinks you're talking a load of shit.
Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

906
01:00:37,354 --> 01:00:38,605
Pain in the arse.

907
01:00:38,855 --> 01:00:40,899
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

908
01:00:40,982 --> 01:00:42,818
I was extremely shocked
when I looked at my watch

909
01:00:42,901 --> 01:00:44,319
and discovered that I should be in the pub.

910
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:46,696
Did you go to his house?
Did you read his articles?

911
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,242
If you wanna wade through every copy of
the Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.

912
01:00:50,325 --> 01:00:52,244
It's your job, isn't it? Detect!

913
01:00:52,327 --> 01:00:56,581
This ain't the city, Mr. Angel.
Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.

914
01:00:56,748 --> 01:01:00,168
It's high time you realized that.
You and your monkey.

915
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:05,465
Did he mean me or that?

916
01:01:07,134 --> 01:01:09,344
Oh, maybe we should go home.

917
01:01:09,553 --> 01:01:12,639
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?

918
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:14,349
Have you listened to anything that I've said?

919
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:15,559
What do you mean?

920
01:01:15,642 --> 01:01:17,185
Is anything I've told you
in the last two weeks

921
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:19,312
- sunk into that thick skull of yours?
- Yeah.

922
01:01:19,396 --> 01:01:21,106
Has it? Like what?

923
01:01:21,648 --> 01:01:23,567
You said I could be
an amazing policeman-officer.

924
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,069
There's always something going on, Danny.

925
01:01:26,153 --> 01:01:29,781
And you won't be an amazing police officer
until you understand that.

926
01:01:29,865 --> 01:01:32,242
Well, I remembered something else
you said and all.

927
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:33,952
- Oh, did you now?
- Yeah.

928
01:01:34,035 --> 01:01:36,329
You don't know how to switch off!

929
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:11,990
Well, if you wanna wade through every copy

930
01:02:12,073 --> 01:02:14,367
of the Sandford bloody Citizen,
be our guest.

931
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:54,533
- Morning, Constable.
- All right?

932
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:57,786
Thanks for the monkey.

933
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,164
- Yours, isn't it?
- I won it for you.

934
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:06,753
Danny, I think I'm on to something.

935
01:03:06,837 --> 01:03:08,004
- Are you?
- Yes.

936
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:12,425
And I think with a little deliberation
we can figure out what links these deaths.

937
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:16,304
- We?
- Come on, partner. Let's go to work.

938
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,349
Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?

939
01:03:19,432 --> 01:03:24,062
- Someone from London called for you.
- Tell them I'll call them back.

940
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:26,022
- Tim Messenger.
- Go.

941
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:27,941
Editor and journalist
at The Sandford Citizen.

942
01:03:28,024 --> 01:03:29,317
- Fondness for puns.
- Go on.

943
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:30,527
- Terrible speller.
- Oh, yeah?

944
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,571
Nevertheless had uncovered
important information about...

945
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:34,406
- George Merchant.
- Self-made millionaire.

946
01:03:34,364 --> 01:03:36,533
Fancied himself as a property developer.

947
01:03:36,616 --> 01:03:39,369
- Said he had big plans for Sandford.
- Pissed on the floor in The Crown.

948
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:41,621
But more importantly,
was a good friend and client of...

949
01:03:41,705 --> 01:03:43,457
- Martin Blower.
- Respected solicitor.

950
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,792
- Affirmatron.
- Leading light of the local drama society.

951
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:47,294
- Bad actor.
- Undoubtedly.

952
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:48,920
- Bad driver.
- Not necessarily.

953
01:03:49,045 --> 01:03:50,672
- Cheated on his missus.
- Most certainly.

954
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:52,716
- And we both know who with.
- Eve Draper.

955
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,635
- Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
- True.

956
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:57,137
- Favored older men.
- Fingered.

957
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,472
- Worked at?
- Council.

958
01:03:58,555 --> 01:04:01,266
- More specifically?
- Department of Planning and Development.

959
01:04:01,391 --> 01:04:02,976
Where George Merchant secured permission

960
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,437
to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

961
01:04:05,562 --> 01:04:06,646
So...

962
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:10,817
Maybe they were all accidents.
People have accidents every day.

963
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:14,654
- What are you two up to?
- Nothing.

964
01:04:14,738 --> 01:04:15,864
Well, look sharp.

965
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:18,700
- There's been reports of a fire in the station.
- What?

966
01:04:18,825 --> 01:04:22,454
Happy birthday to you

967
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:26,750
Happy birthday to you

968
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:30,504
- Danny, why didn't you say something?
- We were working, weren't we?

969
01:04:32,923 --> 01:04:35,967
- Hey, where are you going?
- Personal errand.

970
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:44,184
Hello, Miss Tiller.

971
01:04:44,267 --> 01:04:46,978
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

972
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,480
Of course.

973
01:04:49,272 --> 01:04:51,691
I was just about to pop off, actually.

974
01:04:52,526 --> 01:04:54,820
I can never find my scissors.

975
01:04:55,112 --> 01:04:59,032
- Is this for someone special?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

976
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:06,081
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
- Yes. I'm moving away.

977
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:10,377
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

978
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:15,298
- Well, just between you and I...
- Yes?

979
01:05:15,549 --> 01:05:18,426
- You know that fella who blew up?
- George Merchant.

980
01:05:18,552 --> 01:05:21,680
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

981
01:05:21,805 --> 01:05:25,350
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

982
01:05:25,475 --> 01:05:27,561
and I thought I might take them up on it.

983
01:05:27,644 --> 01:05:31,356
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

984
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:34,901
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

985
01:05:34,985 --> 01:05:36,987
Would you like a card with this?

986
01:05:37,154 --> 01:05:39,448
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

987
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:42,742
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

988
01:05:42,826 --> 01:05:44,995
knew where the new bypass road is going

989
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:48,165
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

990
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:51,960
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

991
01:05:52,085 --> 01:05:54,171
and tells me this land's very valuable.

992
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:58,341
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

993
01:05:58,425 --> 01:06:01,428
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

994
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:04,306
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

995
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:06,433
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

996
01:06:06,516 --> 01:06:09,352
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping center or something.

997
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:12,230
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

998
01:06:12,355 --> 01:06:14,399
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

999
01:06:14,524 --> 01:06:17,110
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

1000
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:33,543
Stop!

1001
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:36,046
In the name of the law!

1002
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,231
Hang about, hang about.

1003
01:07:37,107 --> 01:07:39,359
You're saying this wasn't an accident?

1004
01:07:40,694 --> 01:07:42,737
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!

1005
01:07:42,863 --> 01:07:44,281
- What, just like Tim Messenger?
- Yes!

1006
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:45,532
- And George Merchant?
- Yes!

1007
01:07:45,615 --> 01:07:46,867
- And Eve Draper?
- Yes!

1008
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,577
- And Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

1009
01:07:48,702 --> 01:07:50,537
- Really?
- 'Course he fucking was!

1010
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,539
Thank you, Danny.

1011
01:07:52,622 --> 01:07:55,959
Oh, murder, murder, murder.
Change the fucking record.

1012
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,711
Thank you, Andy.

1013
01:07:57,794 --> 01:08:02,048
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

1014
01:08:02,132 --> 01:08:03,216
What are you suggesting?

1015
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,802
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

1016
01:08:05,886 --> 01:08:08,346
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

1017
01:08:08,472 --> 01:08:11,892
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes you think it was murder?

1018
01:08:11,975 --> 01:08:14,936
- Because I was there!
- There's a point.

1019
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:16,396
Why were you there?

1020
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,734
I was buying Constable Butterman
a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

1021
01:08:20,817 --> 01:08:23,403
What absolute horseshit.

1022
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:27,449
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!

1023
01:08:27,574 --> 01:08:30,619
Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

1024
01:08:30,744 --> 01:08:33,413
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
weren't he?

1025
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:36,958
Am I going completely mad?

1026
01:08:39,085 --> 01:08:40,754
Maybe you are.

1027
01:08:42,672 --> 01:08:45,425
Maybe you did it.

1028
01:08:45,509 --> 01:08:48,845
Yeah, seeing as how you're such
a big fan of murder.

1029
01:08:48,929 --> 01:08:50,347
- What the...
- Sergeant Angel?

1030
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,933
Yes! Sir.

1031
01:08:55,519 --> 01:08:58,396
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.

1032
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:01,066
What am I going to do with you?

1033
01:09:01,191 --> 01:09:05,695
- Sir, you have to understand...
- No, you have to understand.

1034
01:09:06,696 --> 01:09:10,659
The boys here aren't used
to the concepts you're bandying about.

1035
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:13,787
The "M" word, Nicholas.

1036
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:18,083
There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

1037
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:20,001
But, sir, I'm certain.

1038
01:09:20,544 --> 01:09:23,755
And what's more, I know who did it.

1039
01:09:29,803 --> 01:09:31,721
Can I see the manager, please?

1040
01:09:37,227 --> 01:09:43,191
Mr. Skinner to the Manager's office.
Manager's office. Mr. Skinner.

1041
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,362
Sergeant Angel.
And to what do I owe this pleasure?

1042
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:51,533
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.

1043
01:09:51,658 --> 01:09:55,078
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?

1044
01:09:55,245 --> 01:09:57,539
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

1045
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:02,502
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of
the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,

1046
01:10:02,586 --> 01:10:04,212
of George Merchant on April 29th

1047
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:06,882
and of Eve Draper
and Martin Blower on April 28th.

1048
01:10:07,007 --> 01:10:10,969
- Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?
- I'm glad you asked.

1049
01:10:12,762 --> 01:10:14,890
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

1050
01:10:15,015 --> 01:10:17,767
at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,
on the outskirts of Sandford,

1051
01:10:17,851 --> 01:10:21,688
despite the fact you live and work
in the center of the village.

1052
01:10:22,939 --> 01:10:27,235
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theater on the previous evening.

1053
01:10:27,527 --> 01:10:30,447
When you not only indicated
an awareness of the couple's affair

1054
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,532
but also inferred
that Eve's connections at the council

1055
01:10:32,616 --> 01:10:35,577
might make her privy
to important information.

1056
01:10:35,702 --> 01:10:37,954
You even spoke of "bashing her head in."

1057
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:41,666
Perhaps hoping you might discover
the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

1058
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,960
You were already suspicious
that George Merchant was buying up

1059
01:10:44,085 --> 01:10:46,338
a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford,

1060
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:49,382
after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the Sandford Citizen.

1061
01:10:49,508 --> 01:10:53,136
You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

1062
01:10:53,261 --> 01:10:57,140
if it became accessible by road,
it would be a prime location for say,

1063
01:10:57,516 --> 01:10:59,184
a retail park.

1064
01:10:59,267 --> 01:11:01,269
Consumed with concern for your business

1065
01:11:01,353 --> 01:11:03,396
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

1066
01:11:03,522 --> 01:11:06,066
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

1067
01:11:06,608 --> 01:11:09,277
You killed the competition in cold blood.

1068
01:11:09,361 --> 01:11:11,238
Staging the murders as accidents.

1069
01:11:11,363 --> 01:11:14,407
You used a vehicle removal truck
to stage the Blower-Draper death

1070
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:16,409
and incinerated an old man
in his own house.

1071
01:11:16,535 --> 01:11:19,704
Covering your tracks with the judicial
application of bacon and beans.

1072
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:22,749
However, there was a loose end.

1073
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:25,252
Tim Messenger.

1074
01:11:25,377 --> 01:11:27,504
Splattered before he could share with me

1075
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:30,549
what he told Leslie Tiller
that very afternoon.

1076
01:11:30,632 --> 01:11:33,468
The true value of her land.

1077
01:11:33,885 --> 01:11:36,763
Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

1078
01:11:36,888 --> 01:11:39,683
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

1079
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:44,521
And made good your escape utilizing
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

1080
01:11:50,986 --> 01:11:54,781
Very entertaining. But I rather think
you've been watching too many films.

1081
01:11:56,408 --> 01:11:57,451
He hasn't.

1082
01:11:57,534 --> 01:12:01,288
Why would I kill Leslie?
You clearly aren't aware that we're related.

1083
01:12:01,413 --> 01:12:03,957
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

1084
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,796
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

1085
01:12:10,088 --> 01:12:13,467
My teenage years studying ballet
are well known.

1086
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:16,720
- Yeah, Sissy Skinner.
- What a Gaylord.

1087
01:12:16,803 --> 01:12:18,346
Thank you, Andrews.

1088
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:21,808
Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

1089
01:12:21,933 --> 01:12:25,437
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

1090
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,149
Anything to energize my workforce.

1091
01:12:30,692 --> 01:12:35,280
And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

1092
01:12:35,363 --> 01:12:37,824
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

1093
01:12:37,949 --> 01:12:41,286
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

1094
01:12:41,369 --> 01:12:43,538
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

1095
01:12:43,622 --> 01:12:46,082
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

1096
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:48,543
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

1097
01:12:48,627 --> 01:12:51,546
Many people hold down several jobs.

1098
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:55,342
I myself host a life drawing class
at the Village Hall.

1099
01:12:55,425 --> 01:12:58,470
Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

1100
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:02,682
Nevertheless, you could have utilized
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

1101
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:04,810
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

1102
01:13:04,893 --> 01:13:07,521
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

1103
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:10,190
Well, you've got me there.

1104
01:13:10,315 --> 01:13:12,275
I'd need something conclusive.

1105
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,528
Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

1106
01:13:14,653 --> 01:13:18,657
Perhaps a wound you sustained on
a piece of broken glass this very evening.

1107
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:21,952
This very evening.

1108
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:26,498
Sergeant, this is beginning
to get embarrassing.

1109
01:13:26,623 --> 01:13:29,751
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1110
01:13:32,087 --> 01:13:36,716
I'm sure the store's security footage
will absolve me.

1111
01:13:37,425 --> 01:13:40,095
Do feel free to spool through.

1112
01:13:57,612 --> 01:13:58,655
I can handle this, Danny.

1113
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:02,033
You might as well go back
and just enjoy the rest of your birthday.

1114
01:14:02,117 --> 01:14:04,703
- Did you really get me that plant?
- Yes, I did.

1115
01:14:04,786 --> 01:14:08,248
But it's been impounded as evidence.

1116
01:14:08,373 --> 01:14:12,961
Well, I mean,
maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?

1117
01:14:13,044 --> 01:14:14,212
Yeah.

1118
01:14:17,632 --> 01:14:19,050
Sergeant, I wanted you to know that

1119
01:14:19,134 --> 01:14:22,471
if I do indeed now
own the land belonging to...

1120
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:30,061
belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it
into a memorial garden, in her honor.

1121
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:34,733
Mr. Skinner, what you do with your land
is of no concern of mine,

1122
01:14:37,569 --> 01:14:38,737
so jog on.

1123
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:44,242
Michael, will you escort the Sergeant
off the premises when he's quite finished?

1124
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:45,869
Yarp.

1125
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,335
I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

1126
01:14:53,418 --> 01:14:55,754
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

1127
01:15:03,929 --> 01:15:06,097
Hey, that weren't me.

1128
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:15,315
Hey, look.

1129
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,110
Look, Mr. Treacher's
got his big coat on again.

1130
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:26,201
- You want anything from the shop?
- Cornetto.

1131
01:15:28,787 --> 01:15:32,958
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

1132
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:39,631
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

1133
01:15:39,714 --> 01:15:43,051
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

1134
01:15:43,135 --> 01:15:47,139
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

1135
01:15:47,222 --> 01:15:50,475
- What's the matter? You got brain-freeze?
- No, I got brainwave.

1136
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:52,853
Get us back to the station, now!

1137
01:15:59,818 --> 01:16:01,528
- It's more than one person.
- Come again?

1138
01:16:01,653 --> 01:16:04,489
- It's more than one killer.
- It was Skinner a minute ago.

1139
01:16:04,614 --> 01:16:05,657
Yeah, well, maybe it still is.

1140
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,118
You know, maybe he's... Maybe he's
not alone. Maybe there are others.

1141
01:16:08,243 --> 01:16:13,373
Nicholas, you're an exceptional officer.
But I've seen this before.

1142
01:16:13,832 --> 01:16:16,418
- Sir?
- Sergeant Popwell.

1143
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:19,337
It was exactly the same thing.

1144
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:23,842
You've come from a city
where there's danger round every corner,

1145
01:16:24,342 --> 01:16:26,845
and it's driven you round the bend.

1146
01:16:27,345 --> 01:16:28,638
Yes, sir.

1147
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:32,350
Do yourself a favor. Sleep on it.

1148
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:38,190
And if you still feel the same in the morning,
I give you my word, I'll get right on to it.

1149
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:45,447
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

1150
01:16:46,114 --> 01:16:50,035
Nothing, nothing.
I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.

1151
01:16:50,118 --> 01:16:55,624
- I mean, do you want a lift?
- No, no, I could do with a walk.

1152
01:17:59,104 --> 01:18:01,982
Hey, big one, playtime's over.

1153
01:18:06,361 --> 01:18:07,737
Michael?

1154
01:18:08,655 --> 01:18:11,324
Michael? Are you there?

1155
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:15,996
Michael? Is everything okay?

1156
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:19,833
Yarp.

1157
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,669
Sergeant Angel's been taken care of?

1158
01:18:22,794 --> 01:18:23,879
Yarp.

1159
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:26,423
He's not gonna get back up again?

1160
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:30,343
Narp!

1161
01:18:31,636 --> 01:18:34,181
Good. Proceed to the castle.

1162
01:18:39,436 --> 01:18:41,146
Frank, this shit just got real.

1163
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:45,025
Skinner just sent someone to kill me,
and, now, now he's gone somewhere.

1164
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:47,694
Up to the... To the castle, I think.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.

1165
01:18:47,819 --> 01:18:50,113
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.

1166
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,703
Oh, my God.
What happened to your Peace Lily?

1167
01:18:56,995 --> 01:19:00,832
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?
And watch him, and call your dad.

1168
01:19:00,957 --> 01:19:03,043
- Tell him I was right.
- What are you gonna do?

1169
01:19:03,126 --> 01:19:07,756
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.
- Nicholas, wait.

1170
01:19:07,798 --> 01:19:11,551
- You might need this.
- Thanks, partner.

1171
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:48,171
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1172
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:51,424
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1173
01:19:51,508 --> 01:19:54,803
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1174
01:19:55,929 --> 01:20:00,058
I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

1175
01:20:00,183 --> 01:20:03,228
You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.

1176
01:20:03,353 --> 01:20:05,147
Who could do something like this?

1177
01:20:05,272 --> 01:20:08,608
Seems like Mr. Merchant tried
to have a little fry up and left the gas on.

1178
01:20:08,692 --> 01:20:10,026
Nasty way to go.

1179
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:11,236
What happened, Danny?

1180
01:20:11,361 --> 01:20:13,155
No luck catching them killers, then?

1181
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,115
No luck catching them killers, then?

1182
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:17,409
No luck catching them...

1183
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:23,290
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

1184
01:20:23,373 --> 01:20:27,752
Janet Barker has decided
to call her boys Roger and Martin.

1185
01:20:27,878 --> 01:20:33,133
And the christening will be
a week on Saturday and we're all invited.

1186
01:20:33,383 --> 01:20:35,719
- Tom.
- Thanks, Joyce.

1187
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:39,055
Now, you'll all be delighted to hear

1188
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:43,810
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.

1189
01:20:43,894 --> 01:20:49,483
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying
on the wet floor of his bathroom,

1190
01:20:49,566 --> 01:20:53,820
having slipped
and tragically broken his neck.

1191
01:20:53,945 --> 01:20:55,989
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,

1192
01:20:56,072 --> 01:21:00,160
we will now be able to concentrate
on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.

1193
01:21:00,243 --> 01:21:01,328
Quite right.

1194
01:21:01,411 --> 01:21:04,873
After which, nothing will stand in our way.

1195
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:07,834
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr. Weaver.

1196
01:21:07,959 --> 01:21:12,172
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

1197
01:21:12,506 --> 01:21:15,675
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police Service.

1198
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:18,512
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

1199
01:21:18,595 --> 01:21:21,473
I'm arresting you under suspicion
of conspiracy to commit murder.

1200
01:21:21,556 --> 01:21:24,351
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.

1201
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:26,019
You should be ashamed.

1202
01:21:26,103 --> 01:21:29,689
- Calling yourself a community that cares.
- Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

1203
01:21:29,773 --> 01:21:31,525
It's all about the greater good.

1204
01:21:31,608 --> 01:21:33,110
The greater good.

1205
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:34,694
How can this be for the greater good?

1206
01:21:34,778 --> 01:21:36,321
The greater good.

1207
01:21:36,446 --> 01:21:38,532
You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, Sergeant,

1208
01:21:38,615 --> 01:21:40,325
the truth is far less complex.

1209
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:45,622
Blower's fate was simply the result
of his being an appalling actor.

1210
01:21:47,124 --> 01:21:48,375
Quite appalling.

1211
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:50,210
You murdered him for that?

1212
01:21:51,294 --> 01:21:53,713
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
- What?

1213
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:57,300
The Dramatic Society
is an important feather in our cap.

1214
01:21:57,634 --> 01:21:59,094
Couldn't let
Blower jeopardize that.

1215
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,429
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

1216
01:22:01,555 --> 01:22:04,099
Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in Straw Dogs.

1217
01:22:04,224 --> 01:22:06,059
And Sheree played a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.

1218
01:22:06,143 --> 01:22:07,561
Yes, I know!

1219
01:22:07,644 --> 01:22:10,272
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

1220
01:22:10,397 --> 01:22:13,567
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

1221
01:22:13,692 --> 01:22:15,235
And so Eve deserved to die too?

1222
01:22:15,318 --> 01:22:17,737
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

1223
01:22:17,863 --> 01:22:19,072
Annoying.

1224
01:22:19,156 --> 01:22:21,992
- And, and George Merchant?
- He had an awful house.

1225
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:23,368
Awful.

1226
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:25,120
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

1227
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:27,747
more in keeping
with the village's rustic esthetic.

1228
01:22:28,832 --> 01:22:31,418
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

1229
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:36,214
Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of
the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.

1230
01:22:36,339 --> 01:22:40,135
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

1231
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,179
Not to mention persistent errors.

1232
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:45,515
- He listed her age as 55.
- When, actually, I'm 53.

1233
01:22:45,599 --> 01:22:47,100
Fifty-three.

1234
01:22:47,184 --> 01:22:48,852
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

1235
01:22:48,935 --> 01:22:51,438
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

1236
01:22:51,521 --> 01:22:53,565
Oh, she was ever so good.

1237
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,817
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

1238
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:59,821
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

1239
01:22:59,946 --> 01:23:03,283
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

1240
01:23:03,366 --> 01:23:05,327
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

1241
01:23:05,452 --> 01:23:08,121
If we can't have her, no one can.

1242
01:23:08,205 --> 01:23:09,748
How can this be for the greater good?

1243
01:23:09,873 --> 01:23:11,875
- The greater good.
- Shut it!

1244
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:15,128
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

1245
01:23:15,212 --> 01:23:17,714
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1246
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:20,842
Hello, Nicholas.

1247
01:23:21,968 --> 01:23:23,845
I was like you once.

1248
01:23:24,471 --> 01:23:27,891
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

1249
01:23:28,225 --> 01:23:32,020
That is until the night Mrs. Butterman
was taken from me.

1250
01:23:32,938 --> 01:23:35,607
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

1251
01:23:35,732 --> 01:23:39,694
She was head of the Women's Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

1252
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:41,863
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

1253
01:23:41,988 --> 01:23:45,659
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

1254
01:23:47,035 --> 01:23:52,332
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travelers moved into Callahan Park.

1255
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:56,670
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

1256
01:23:56,753 --> 01:23:59,089
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

1257
01:23:59,172 --> 01:24:00,924
Crusty jugglers.

1258
01:24:01,049 --> 01:24:04,094
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

1259
01:24:05,095 --> 01:24:09,224
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

1260
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:14,438
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

1261
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:19,276
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

1262
01:24:19,609 --> 01:24:21,486
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

1263
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:25,449
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

1264
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:28,243
Are you saying this is all about
winning the Best Village Award?

1265
01:24:28,368 --> 01:24:32,038
This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

1266
01:24:32,122 --> 01:24:36,585
- They're happy, contented.
- They're living in a dream world.

1267
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,296
Sergeant Popwell
thought much the same as you.

1268
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:41,423
I'm disappointed
you can't see the bigger picture.

1269
01:24:41,548 --> 01:24:43,925
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

1270
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:45,760
And I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

1271
01:24:45,886 --> 01:24:47,929
You are all gonna have to come with me.

1272
01:24:48,013 --> 01:24:52,100
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you

1273
01:24:52,184 --> 01:24:54,936
who is going to have to come with us.

1274
01:25:02,986 --> 01:25:04,571
Danny, no.

1275
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,452
Back off! Back off!

1276
01:25:10,577 --> 01:25:12,788
Or I swear to God,
you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over

1277
01:25:12,913 --> 01:25:14,331
and accidentally cut off his own head.

1278
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:16,583
Come on, Nicholas.
You haven't got it in you.

1279
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,001
I mean it!

1280
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:22,923
Shit!

1281
01:25:37,687 --> 01:25:41,024
Gypsy scum. Travelers.

1282
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:44,194
Thieving kids. Dog muck.

1283
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:48,323
Crusty jugglers.

1284
01:25:48,532 --> 01:25:52,119
Crusty jugglers. Crusty jugglers.

1285
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:54,329
Crusty jugglers.

1286
01:25:54,454 --> 01:25:58,041
There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

1287
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,086
There's a reason we accommodate
a few of the younglings at the pub.

1288
01:26:01,211 --> 01:26:03,713
Spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

1289
01:26:03,797 --> 01:26:06,591
I'll make sure everyone gets
their just deserts.

1290
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:14,599
If we don't come down hard
on these clowns...

1291
01:26:14,724 --> 01:26:16,393
We'll get round to it.

1292
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:29,823
Danny!

1293
01:27:04,775 --> 01:27:06,109
Ta-da.

1294
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:09,529
- What are you doing?
- Saving your skin.

1295
01:27:11,782 --> 01:27:14,493
- This is murder!
- It's not, it's ketchup.

1296
01:27:14,576 --> 01:27:17,329
I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about the others.

1297
01:27:17,412 --> 01:27:20,373
- What others?
- The others the NWA have murdered.

1298
01:27:20,415 --> 01:27:21,792
- That's not true.
- It is!

1299
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:24,044
Dad just said it was his special club, he...

1300
01:27:24,085 --> 01:27:25,962
I thought it was about
rapping people on the knuckles

1301
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:29,257
- and sending them on their way.
- There are skeletons back there!

1302
01:27:29,341 --> 01:27:30,926
I don't know nothing about no skelingtons.

1303
01:27:31,009 --> 01:27:33,261
- What did you think was happening?
- Not this!

1304
01:27:33,345 --> 01:27:34,471
It's Frank.

1305
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:36,765
He's appointed himself judge,
jury and executioner.

1306
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:40,185
- He's not Judge Judy and executioner.
- He is!

1307
01:27:40,268 --> 01:27:43,438
- You've gotta help me take him down.
- I can't.

1308
01:27:44,523 --> 01:27:47,317
He's my dad. Take my car.

1309
01:27:48,401 --> 01:27:51,363
Go back to London.
There's nothing you can do.

1310
01:27:51,488 --> 01:27:52,948
I can come back.

1311
01:27:53,073 --> 01:27:55,158
I can come back,
and I can bring the blue fury

1312
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:57,285
of the Metropolitan Police Service with me.

1313
01:27:57,369 --> 01:28:00,372
They'll make it disappear.
Who are they gonna believe?

1314
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:03,208
My dad, or a loony London police officer.

1315
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,835
But it won't be just me, will it?

1316
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,130
We can do it together.
You and me. Partners.

1317
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:12,134
Forget it, Nicholas. It's Sandford.

1318
01:29:04,269 --> 01:29:05,604
Is that everything? Sir?

1319
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:15,530
Sir? Sir?

1320
01:29:17,032 --> 01:29:21,244
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No.

1321
01:29:24,456 --> 01:29:26,750
This is something I have to do myself.

1322
01:29:52,442 --> 01:29:56,279
Another beautiful day in God's country.

1323
01:30:03,954 --> 01:30:05,455
Danny?

1324
01:30:14,506 --> 01:30:15,799
It's...

1325
01:30:21,138 --> 01:30:22,222
Mum!

1326
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,068
What you gonna do?

1327
01:30:35,193 --> 01:30:38,238
Just walk in and arrest the whole village?

1328
01:30:40,031 --> 01:30:41,199
Not exactly.

1329
01:31:14,232 --> 01:31:17,444
Oh, Sergeant Angel?
Someone from London called for you.

1330
01:31:25,577 --> 01:31:27,829
I'll tell them you'll ring them back.

1331
01:31:30,081 --> 01:31:32,250
- Well, that's funny.
- What's that?

1332
01:31:32,751 --> 01:31:35,420
I didn't know we had a mounted division.

1333
01:31:35,504 --> 01:31:37,214
Nobody tells me nothing.

1334
01:31:53,605 --> 01:31:55,398
Wanna do something useful?

1335
01:32:04,866 --> 01:32:09,788
Annette, that Sergeant Angel's
back. Check out his horse.

1336
01:32:10,789 --> 01:32:12,707
Roger that!

1337
01:32:14,459 --> 01:32:17,420
- It's...
- Angel.

1338
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:29,868
Morning.

1339
01:34:53,452 --> 01:34:55,370
That's what I'm talking about.

1340
01:35:10,302 --> 01:35:12,471
Still feel like you're missing out?

1341
01:35:39,122 --> 01:35:40,540
Fascist!

1342
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,308
Hag!

1343
01:36:16,827 --> 01:36:20,497
Stop! Stop this, please!

1344
01:36:21,164 --> 01:36:24,543
Let us stop this mindless violence.

1345
01:36:25,836 --> 01:36:27,838
Nicholas, my son.

1346
01:36:29,005 --> 01:36:32,926
You may not be a man of God,
but surely you're a man of peace.

1347
01:36:33,009 --> 01:36:38,765
I may not be a man of God, Reverend,
but I know right, and I know wrong,

1348
01:36:39,516 --> 01:36:42,060
and I have the good grace
to know which is which.

1349
01:36:42,185 --> 01:36:45,188
Oh, fuck off, Grasshopper.

1350
01:36:46,773 --> 01:36:48,233
No!

1351
01:36:49,443 --> 01:36:51,194
Jesus Christ!

1352
01:36:51,695 --> 01:36:53,697
Nicholas! Nicholas!

1353
01:37:00,036 --> 01:37:01,788
I thought you was a goner.

1354
01:37:01,872 --> 01:37:03,582
Drop your weapons!

1355
01:37:04,207 --> 01:37:06,626
- Dr. Hatcher, no!
- Shut up, Danny.

1356
01:37:07,627 --> 01:37:11,131
I brought you into this world,
I think it's rather fitting

1357
01:37:11,214 --> 01:37:14,050
I should be the one to take you out of it.

1358
01:37:14,384 --> 01:37:18,221
You and your interfering little friend.

1359
01:37:18,722 --> 01:37:19,848
Now...

1360
01:37:24,227 --> 01:37:25,479
drop them.

1361
01:37:41,995 --> 01:37:46,124
- You're a doctor, deal with it.
- Yeah, motherfucker.

1362
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,085
- Danny, let's roll.
- What you thinking?

1363
01:37:51,087 --> 01:37:52,172
Pub?

1364
01:38:52,315 --> 01:38:54,276
Roy!

1365
01:38:54,985 --> 01:38:58,029
Somebody call the police!

1366
01:38:58,155 --> 01:38:59,281
Freeze!

1367
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:04,995
Officers, arrest that man.

1368
01:39:05,495 --> 01:39:08,665
- Danny, step away from the Sergeant.
- No, Dad.

1369
01:39:09,082 --> 01:39:11,460
Danny, you'll do as you're told.

1370
01:39:11,585 --> 01:39:14,045
I'm not taking orders from you anymore.

1371
01:39:14,171 --> 01:39:17,632
- Officers, arrest these men!
- Wait, wait!

1372
01:39:17,757 --> 01:39:18,842
You can arrest us if you like.

1373
01:39:18,925 --> 01:39:21,553
You can throw us in prison and go back
to being blind, submissive slaves.

1374
01:39:21,678 --> 01:39:23,472
Or you can be real police officers,

1375
01:39:23,597 --> 01:39:25,766
and help us bring an end
to this absurd story.

1376
01:39:25,849 --> 01:39:28,018
What the fuck is he on about?

1377
01:39:28,101 --> 01:39:29,311
Fuck are you on about?

1378
01:39:29,436 --> 01:39:32,022
Have you ever wondered
why the crime rate in Sandford is so low?

1379
01:39:32,105 --> 01:39:35,901
- And yet the accident rate, it's so high?
- No. Yeah. What?

1380
01:39:36,026 --> 01:39:37,861
You've been brainwashed, Tony.

1381
01:39:37,944 --> 01:39:41,198
Brainwashed into naivety by an old man
with a murderous obsession.

1382
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:46,203
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's not, Dad. It's very unridiculous.

1383
01:39:46,286 --> 01:39:49,331
And it's only now that I'm starting to realize
how unridiculous it all is.

1384
01:39:49,456 --> 01:39:50,916
Silence, Danny!

1385
01:39:51,374 --> 01:39:54,169
- Think of your mother.
- Mum is dead, Dad.

1386
01:39:55,378 --> 01:39:58,757
For the first time in my life,
you know, I'm glad.

1387
01:39:58,882 --> 01:40:01,218
If she could see what you've become,

1388
01:40:01,301 --> 01:40:05,430
I think she'd probably kill herself
all over again.

1389
01:40:05,555 --> 01:40:07,099
Sorry, I am completely lost.

1390
01:40:07,224 --> 01:40:08,850
Sandford is a lie, Doris.

1391
01:40:08,975 --> 01:40:12,354
For the last 20 years, the village
has been controlled by Frank and the NWA.

1392
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:14,898
They've lulled everyone
into thinking this is a perfect village

1393
01:40:14,981 --> 01:40:17,776
and killed anyone
who's threatened to change that.

1394
01:40:25,408 --> 01:40:27,494
I reckon he's got something there.

1395
01:40:28,995 --> 01:40:31,957
He says,
"He reckons you got something there."

1396
01:40:32,082 --> 01:40:33,291
I know.

1397
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:36,628
You're not seriously gonna
believe this man, are you?

1398
01:40:36,753 --> 01:40:39,798
Are you? He isn't even from round here.

1399
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,973
Maybe it's time to give it up, sir.

1400
01:40:49,683 --> 01:40:52,227
You incompetent flatfoots!

1401
01:41:01,361 --> 01:41:04,030
Officer Walker, stay here with Saxon
and hold everything down.

1402
01:41:04,114 --> 01:41:05,240
Fair enough.

1403
01:41:05,365 --> 01:41:07,367
Officers, let's go.

1404
01:41:08,368 --> 01:41:10,704
- What about Dad?
- He'll come round again.

1405
01:41:11,037 --> 01:41:12,831
Want anything from the shop?

1406
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,808
- What you thinking?
- Well...

1407
01:41:31,892 --> 01:41:33,894
We should strike now,
while we've got the element of surprise.

1408
01:41:33,977 --> 01:41:35,771
Longer we wait,
more time they've got to mobilize.

1409
01:41:35,896 --> 01:41:38,648
I say we go in through the front entrance,
take the place aisle by aisle.

1410
01:41:38,732 --> 01:41:40,609
They won't be expecting that.

1411
01:41:41,234 --> 01:41:42,903
Very good. What he said.

1412
01:41:45,155 --> 01:41:48,366
My, my. Here come the fuzz.

1413
01:41:50,577 --> 01:41:53,371
- Maybe they're not here.
- Wait here.

1414
01:41:53,497 --> 01:41:57,000
- Don't go in on your own.
- Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.

1415
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,546
Okay. They're in.

1416
01:42:01,671 --> 01:42:04,758
You deal with the store.
I'll deal with the trolley boy.

1417
01:42:14,101 --> 01:42:18,563
No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, Michael,
wait, listen to me. Listen, listen.

1418
01:42:18,772 --> 01:42:21,316
Is this what you really, really want?

1419
01:42:21,608 --> 01:42:22,734
Yarp.

1420
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:24,319
Suit yourself.

1421
01:42:33,036 --> 01:42:34,704
Go, go, go.

1422
01:42:37,124 --> 01:42:39,209
Oh, come on.

1423
01:42:51,555 --> 01:42:53,390
Andy!

1424
01:42:56,143 --> 01:42:59,104
It's all right, Andy. It's just Bolognese!

1425
01:43:59,539 --> 01:44:01,500
- How's Lurch?
- He's in the freezer.

1426
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,960
- Did you say, "Cool off"?
- No, I didn't say anything, actually.

1427
01:44:04,085 --> 01:44:05,754
Shame.

1428
01:44:05,837 --> 01:44:07,255
There was a bit earlier on that you missed

1429
01:44:07,339 --> 01:44:08,924
when I distracted him
with the cuddly monkey.

1430
01:44:09,007 --> 01:44:11,802
And then I said, "Playtime's over,"
and I hit him with the Peace Lily.

1431
01:44:11,927 --> 01:44:13,970
You're off the fucking chain!

1432
01:44:14,096 --> 01:44:17,557
- What's the situation?
- Two blokes and a fuckload of cutlery.

1433
01:44:17,682 --> 01:44:19,059
What do you reckon?

1434
01:44:22,437 --> 01:44:23,605
Idea.

1435
01:44:47,295 --> 01:44:48,797
Good work, everyone.

1436
01:44:58,557 --> 01:45:01,518
- Nice one, Doris.
- Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.

1437
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:06,273
Fruit attack!

1438
01:45:07,065 --> 01:45:09,901
Can you handle this, Sergeant Fisher?
We're gonna go after the big boss.

1439
01:45:09,985 --> 01:45:11,903
We're on it, Sergeant.

1440
01:45:12,404 --> 01:45:14,197
- Danny, let's rock.
- Angel!

1441
01:45:14,322 --> 01:45:16,032
Don't go being a twat now.

1442
01:45:16,324 --> 01:45:18,577
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

1443
01:45:25,834 --> 01:45:27,377
- We should get down there.
- How?

1444
01:45:27,502 --> 01:45:29,880
Skip.

1445
01:45:35,844 --> 01:45:38,889
- Head them off?
- Fuck, yeah.

1446
01:45:50,192 --> 01:45:53,820
- I'll drive.
- Shotgun! Punch that shit!

1447
01:46:37,656 --> 01:46:39,199
Bang! Bang!

1448
01:46:45,163 --> 01:46:46,498
Swan!

1449
01:47:05,934 --> 01:47:07,018
Swan!

1450
01:47:34,546 --> 01:47:38,717
Stay back! Or the ginger nut gets it!

1451
01:47:40,635 --> 01:47:43,221
You little fucker!

1452
01:48:19,007 --> 01:48:23,303
Get out of my village!

1453
01:48:29,267 --> 01:48:31,770
It's not your village anymore.

1454
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:50,455
- You did good, kid.
- Ta.

1455
01:48:50,539 --> 01:48:52,791
- What's your name?
- Aaron A. Aaronson.

1456
01:48:53,208 --> 01:48:54,668
Sorry?

1457
01:48:56,628 --> 01:49:03,260
Angel!

1458
01:49:21,153 --> 01:49:22,487
It's over, Danny.

1459
01:49:23,905 --> 01:49:25,073
It's over.

1460
01:49:28,910 --> 01:49:34,166
This really hurts.

1461
01:49:34,249 --> 01:49:39,671
I'm going to need some ice-cream.

1462
01:49:39,755 --> 01:49:42,924
Yeah, well, don't worry.
There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.

1463
01:49:43,008 --> 01:49:44,176
Isn't that right, Danny?

1464
01:49:45,427 --> 01:49:46,553
Stay back!

1465
01:49:46,678 --> 01:49:50,098
- Pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard!
- Now, now.

1466
01:49:50,432 --> 01:49:52,184
We don't want any more bloodshed.

1467
01:49:52,267 --> 01:49:55,020
Frank, this whole thing started
because you lost somebody you loved.

1468
01:49:55,103 --> 01:49:57,022
Don't expect me to believe
you'd let it end the same way.

1469
01:49:57,105 --> 01:49:59,649
I'll tell you how this is gonna end!

1470
01:50:42,234 --> 01:50:44,402
I feel like I should say something smart.

1471
01:50:44,486 --> 01:50:47,280
You don't have to say anything at all.

1472
01:50:59,167 --> 01:51:02,587
Satisfactory conclusion
to the whole operation.

1473
01:51:02,671 --> 01:51:06,675
Now, my perfect Sunday would begin with...

1474
01:51:12,013 --> 01:51:13,432
What do you say, Nicholas?

1475
01:51:13,515 --> 01:51:15,725
We... We...
We have been trying to reach you for days.

1476
01:51:15,851 --> 01:51:18,979
- Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy.
- We need you back.

1477
01:51:19,104 --> 01:51:22,899
The figures have gone a little squiffy
in your absence, it has to be said.

1478
01:51:23,024 --> 01:51:24,109
Come back to London.

1479
01:51:24,192 --> 01:51:27,446
Sandford's hardly a fitting place
for such an exceptional officer.

1480
01:51:27,529 --> 01:51:30,240
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.

1481
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:32,951
I kind of like it here.

1482
01:51:33,034 --> 01:51:36,413
Besides, we have to do
a considerable amount of paperwork.

1483
01:52:06,818 --> 01:52:07,903
- Fuck's sake, Nick, this is gonna take ages.
- Yeah, it's gonna take all night.

1484
01:52:07,903 --> 01:52:08,904
Well, good job
we've got the manpower, Andy?

1485
01:52:09,237 --> 01:52:13,492
Well, official vocab guidelines state
that we say "staffing," not "manpower,"

1486
01:52:13,575 --> 01:52:16,244
'cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.

1487
01:52:18,663 --> 01:52:20,415
You don't mind a bit
of manpower do you, Doris?

1488
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,834
Oh, dirty bastard!

1489
01:52:24,628 --> 01:52:25,754
Andy!

1490
01:52:25,879 --> 01:52:27,881
You cheeky fucker!

1491
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,558
You know what you are?

1492
01:52:39,392 --> 01:52:41,061
A bloody busybody!

1493
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:49,152
No!

1494
01:53:03,667 --> 01:53:04,835
Oh, God, no!

1495
01:53:28,108 --> 01:53:29,359
Danny!

1496
01:53:31,862 --> 01:53:32,988
Danny!

1497
01:53:34,030 --> 01:53:35,198
Oh, God.

1498
01:53:35,282 --> 01:53:36,908
Hold on, Danny, just hold on.

1499
01:53:37,033 --> 01:53:39,744
Hold on, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

1500
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:43,123
Just hang on, hang on!

1501
01:53:43,623 --> 01:53:45,417
Everything's gonna be fine.

1502
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:48,462
Everything's gonna be fine.

1503
01:53:48,962 --> 01:53:50,756
Everything's gonna be fine.

1504
01:53:51,548 --> 01:53:53,550
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1505
01:54:32,255 --> 01:54:33,298
Hope these are okay.

1506
01:54:36,426 --> 01:54:39,805
Yeah. They're lovely.

1507
01:54:49,356 --> 01:54:52,526
- Any officers near the church?
- Go ahead, Doris.

1508
01:54:52,609 --> 01:54:54,319
Chief, we've had a report
of some hippy types

1509
01:54:54,444 --> 01:54:56,863
messing with the recycling bins
at the supermarket.

1510
01:54:56,947 --> 01:54:58,657
- Leave it with us.
- Righto.

1511
01:54:58,782 --> 01:55:02,869
Sergeant Butterman,
little hand says it's time to rock and roll.

1512
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:04,663
Bring the noise.

1513
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,078
