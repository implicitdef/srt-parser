1
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:03,895
Honey, you got to come see this.

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

3
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:15,579
I'm going to go.

4
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:17,882
I'm taking Violet
and going to Jo's.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,951
Florida?

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,953
I want to get there
before the school year starts.

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,721
I don't understand.

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,790
What about Los Angeles?

9
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:27,458
I thought we agreed
about the fresh start.

10
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:31,362
I just can't.

11
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,631
We really tried.
We haven't tried.

12
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:34,898
I can't do it anymore.

13
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,333
Therapy isn't trying.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,667
It's just figuring stuff out

15
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:39,135
so you can really do something.

16
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:40,403
I've tried.

17
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,805
And as much as I keep trying

18
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:46,343
to let you in again,
this wall comes up,

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,947
and I... I can't...
I can't get past it.

20
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,315
Just look at this house.

21
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,218
Look at this house I found...
it's right near

22
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:56,888
Hancock Park, where all those
big mansions from the '20s are.

23
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,124
You always talked about how much
you wanted a house like this...

24
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:00,325
one with personality.

25
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,593
Well, here it is.

26
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,560
You don't listen.

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,031
The house isn't going
to fix it, Ben.

28
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:08,132
It's just a house, Viv.
Come on.

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,367
Take a look.

30
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,470
<i>It's nice, right?</i>

31
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:15,072
<i>Tiffany lamps and everything.</i>

32
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,874
<i>I don't know, maybe it's</i>
<i>haunted or something.</i>

33
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,809
<i>I mean, it's still a stretch</i>
<i>at that price,</i>

34
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:20,577
<i>but it's been on the market</i>
<i>for a while,</i>

35
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,012
so maybe they'll go lower.

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,313
There's even an office,

37
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,415
<i>so I can see patients at home.</i>

38
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:27,618
<i>I mean, it's perfect.</i>

39
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,520
No.

40
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:32,256
Honey... honey, the reason

41
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:34,692
you can't hold on
to this idea of leaving

42
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,861
is because it's
not what you want.

43
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,730
I-I've been looking
at houses for a month,

44
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,932
and when I found
this one, I swear to God,

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,001
it was like a...
it was like a laser beam

46
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,336
shot right into my brain.

47
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,237
<i>I could see it all so clearly.</i>

48
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,906
It was like a movie in my mind.

49
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:50,174
<i>We were together...</i>
<i>you, me and Violet...</i>

50
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:51,776
all around the fire.

51
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:54,611
<i>Violet was reading</i>
<i>some depressing Russian novel,</i>

52
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,347
and I was stoking the fire,

53
00:01:56,414 --> 00:02:00,551
<i>and you were on the couch</i>
<i>rocking a baby.</i>

54
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,855
Honey... we have made
so many life choices

55
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:06,824
based on our gut,
and right now...

56
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:10,227
my gut is telling me
that this place...

57
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,429
this house is going to...

58
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:14,597
it's going to break down
that wall inside you.

59
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:20,436
I'm sure it's a
beautiful house.

60
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:24,639
I love you so much.

61
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,008
I'm begging you...

62
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:29,611
just come see the house.

63
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,546
The three of us will fly out.

64
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:34,482
Just come see it.

65
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,052
When I look at this place,

66
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,621
for the first time, I feel...

67
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,255
like there's hope.

68
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,560
Vivien?

69
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:52,901
Vivien!

70
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:56,605
Violet!

71
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:58,606
Vivien!

72
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:00,709
Where are you, Vivien?

73
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:02,010
Vivien!

74
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:14,023
Where are you?

75
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,907

76
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:19,106
We weren't expecting
you until tomorrow.

77
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:21,342
After the service.
I know.

78
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,878
But I can't impose on you
like this, Constance.

79
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,213
Don't be silly.

80
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,215
Looking after this little angel

81
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:29,418
is no imposition whatsoever.

82
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,454
And I wouldn't think
of burdening you

83
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,256
with the care of a newborn

84
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,824
during this time of your...

85
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,626
unspeakable tragedy.

86
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,361
Thank you, but...

87
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,630
Vivien's sister
is here now, so...

88
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,299
Oh, I see.

89
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,669
What a blessing

90
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,805
distant relations are
in times of trouble.

91
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,173
If I could just get
his things...

92
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,108
Certainly, uh...

93
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,644
though it is nearly
his lunchtime.

94
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:58,146
I know...
why don't I feed him?

95
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,750
He'll fall right asleep,
and then you can come back

96
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,385
in several hours.
I can feed him.

97
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,454
It's really no trouble at all.

98
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,690
I'm here to get my son,
Constance.

99
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:09,024
Your son... of course.

100
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:10,459
Let me just

101
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,395
gather up his things.

102
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:16,232
This formula
has to be warmed up.

103
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,568
All you have to do is run it

104
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,036
under the hot water tap.
I'll be fine.

105
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:20,437
No, I don't believe you will.

106
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:21,639
Nor will that child

107
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,674
if you take him back
into that house.

108
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,776
Just give me his things.
Dr. Harmon, hear me.

109
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:28,945
There are forces in that house

110
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:32,748
that mean to do this child
grave harm.

111
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,616
We both know that it's true.

112
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:37,385
The same forces
that killed your sweet wife.

113
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,620
Oh, and what
about your daughter?

114
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,022
Tell me, Dr. Harmon,

115
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,425
did you buy a casket
for Violet, too?

116
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:48,629
If that house
can claim her spirit,

117
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:51,631
what's going to happen
to this sweet little baby?

118
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,567
The baby's going to be fine.
Oh, you are a fool!

119
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:54,935
After everything

120
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:56,837
that you've seen...

121
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:59,340
after everything
that has happened,

122
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:01,775
how can you still be so blind?

123
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,549
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Ben Harmon, Tate's therapist.

124
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,251
Yeah, I'm calling because
I can't treat your son anymore.

125
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,253
I'd like... I'd like
to give you the number

126
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:16,088
of another psychiatrist
who I think could help him.

127
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,689
Oh, no, but why, Doctor?

128
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:20,225
Because your son has crossed
a line with my daughter.

129
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,593
Oh, but...

130
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,495
I'm so sorry.

131
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,633
Where is he?

132
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,535
In his grave.

133
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:31,438
Where he's been

134
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,775
longer than he lived
on this Earth.

135
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,344
You destroyed my family.

136
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:37,546
You!

137
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:41,984
You are paying for
your own sins, Dr. Harmon.

138
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,986
Let me give you some advice.

139
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,154
When I leave here,

140
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,089
lock your door

141
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,758
and pray I don't come back.

142
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,500
I wonder, how is your

143
00:06:58,568 --> 00:06:59,835
adjustment going?

144
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,303
I have to say
one of the hardest things

145
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,605
is watching Ben.

146
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,307
He's so devastated.

147
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,311
Yes, well, it's always
the living that make it hard.

148
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,313
Hmm.

149
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,249
You don't need
to run off, dear.

150
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,484
He can't see you unless
you want him to.

151
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:16,421
Right. Keep forgetting.

152
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,261
I want to nurse him so badly.

153
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:26,731
No, Ben.

154
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,732
Not the microwave.

155
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:35,539
You're hovering, dear.

156
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:36,573
It's a bad idea.

157
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:38,174
See, he remembered.

158
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,944
He was a good dad.

159
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,847
Moira, I know you
don't approve,

160
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:46,216
but despite all his flaws...

161
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:48,052
he's a good father.

162
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,320
I'll never understand why you

163
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:50,955
always need to come
to his defense.

164
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,491
Here you go.

165
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,626
Do you want him to see you?

166
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:57,395
Is that what's going on?

167
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:58,563
Are you fighting the
desire to appear?

168
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:00,531
No, I do not want him to see me.

169
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,734
I absolutely do not want him
to see me or Violet.

170
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,135
I have made her promise me,

171
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:05,369
because if he see us,

172
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:07,238
then he is going to want
to stay here.

173
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:10,774
- It's okay, kiddo.
- And he has to leave this house.

174
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:13,443
And raise our baby.

175
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:15,011
Then sit down
and keep your distance.

176
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,780
Remember the endgame.

177
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,448
It's all going to work out.

178
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,233
There's something about
Ben that's different.

179
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,469
He's so sanguine.

180
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:40,438
Perhaps he's dreaming
of all the women

181
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:41,372
he can have relations with.

182
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,041
Forgive me.

183
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,176
I suppose that was unkind.

184
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,816
Moira, would you make me
a cup of tea, please?

185
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:52,451
No.

186
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:55,187
Your denial is impressive.

187
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:56,556
You're a ghost,
Mrs. Harmon.

188
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,358
I don't take orders from ghosts.

189
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,293
I'm your equal now
in this world.

190
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,195
So you are.

191
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:04,330
I owe you an apology.

192
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:06,298
And I think you
should call me Vivien.

193
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:07,899
I'd like that.

194
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:12,871
Vivien, if I may...

195
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:15,840
Leave him be.

196
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:17,741
Don't torture yourself.

197
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,043
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

198
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:23,881
None of this is.

199
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,957
Your Aunt Jo's
going to be here soon.

200
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,878
Okay.

201
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,482
Okay. Okay.

202
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:00,054
It's okay.

203
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,095
You can't do this.
Vivien.

204
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:18,963
I knew you were here.

205
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,331
Why didn't you come to me?

206
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,833
It would just make it worse.

207
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,470
I want you
to take the baby and go.

208
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:27,239
No, just let me do it,
then we can be together.

209
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,607
No, no, no! No.

210
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,645
That baby needs a father, Ben.

211
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:32,846
I'm not his father.

212
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:35,749
You know it, and I know it.

213
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,084
He's my baby,

214
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:40,121
and you shouldn't be smoking.

215
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:44,358
I don't really care
where it came from.

216
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:46,060
I would give anything
if I could take care of him.

217
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:49,696
Vivien, I am...

218
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:54,100
so sorry for everything
I put you through.

219
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:55,302
I want you to hear me.

220
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:58,037
I forgive you.

221
00:11:58,105 --> 00:11:59,439
So enough

222
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,740
with the drama and the tragedy.

223
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,375
We've had enough in this family.

224
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:03,776
We've had enough.

225
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:06,279
And the one spot of light

226
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:09,717
that there is,
is that baby asleep upstairs.

227
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:12,653
That's your opportunity
to do something different.

228
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:14,154
I want you to take the baby,

229
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:15,857
and I want you
to leave this house,

230
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,692
and I want you to never
come back.

231
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,928
Your sister said she
would take care of him.

232
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,463
She's a good mother.

233
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,964
No, I don't want that.

234
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,031
What do you want?

235
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,366
I want to...

236
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:28,202
envision you with that boy
on your shoulders

237
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,871
walking down Newbury Street.

238
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,040
What about Violet?

239
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,608
What about Violet?

240
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,245
I'm a teenage girl.

241
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:40,612
Not exactly a cakewalk.

242
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:44,783
Violet.

243
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,187
What kind of father
have I been?

244
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,623
You weren't eating.
You weren't going to school.

245
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,959
You were already gone,
and... I didn't get it.

246
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:55,527
I shut you out.

247
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:57,495
I was afraid it would break you.

248
00:12:57,563 --> 00:12:59,831
I miss you so much.

249
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,601
I was never getting
into Harvard.

250
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:04,670
Oh...

251
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,305
But I saved you
a shitload of money.

252
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:07,607
Yeah, you did.

253
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:12,746
You have to leave, Dad.

254
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:15,115
Every minute you're
in this house,

255
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,416
you're in danger,
and so is that baby.

256
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:31,398
Please.

257
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,765
Do it for us.

258
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,560
Where are you going, Ben?

259
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,595
You didn't think
I'd just let you leave?

260
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:04,930
Get out of my way, Hayden.

261
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:06,164
I don't have time
for your bullshit.

262
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:21,712
Ah!

263
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:45,672
Now we have all
the time in the world.

264
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:02,034
Welcome!
You must be the Ramos.

265
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,402
Yes. I'm Stacy.
Mm-hmm.

266
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,637
This is my husband Miguel.

267
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,972
Hi.
Miguel.

268
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,541
What an exotic name.
I must confess to a fascination

269
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,977
for all thgs
south of the border.

270
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,012
Actually, my family's from Spain.
Yeah.

271
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,213
All the better.

272
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,582
I find European Hispanics
vastly superior.

273
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,217
This is a classic

274
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:22,855
L.A. Victorian, built in the
1920s by a doctor to the stars.

275
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,525
As you can see,
it's just fabulous.

276
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,428
These are real Tiffany fixtures.
Yeah?

277
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,964
Everything else in the house
has been updated.

278
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,432
Uh, Gabriel.
Hold on.

279
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,602
Uh, I apologize for my son.

280
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,770
Apparently he's got
the skateboard

281
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,272
surgically attached
to his body.

282
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,940
He doesn't go anywhere
without it.

283
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:41,442
It's quite all right, Mr. Ramos.

284
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,377
As long as we don't
leave any marks on the floor.

285
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,580
Are we waiting
for another sibling?

286
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,116
No, we just have the one.
Thank you.

287
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:52,486
The furnishing
is from the previous owner,

288
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,789
but if you see anything
that you like,

289
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:57,558
I'm sure the estate
is open to selling

290
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:00,094
at the right price.

291
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:01,996
- This is amazing, babe.
- Look at this house.

292
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:08,402
Um, speaking of money, Marcy,
I know the, uh, economy is down,

293
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,471
but why is the asking price
so far below market?

294
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:13,841
There isn't a problem
with mold or radon, is there?

295
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:16,144
No. Nothing so simple.

296
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,179
In the interest of
full disclosure,

297
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:21,249
I must inform you that the
previous owners passed away

298
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:22,684
in the house.

299
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:24,920
Oh.
How?

300
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:27,456
The wife died
during childbirth,

301
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:30,393
and the husband, in his grief,
committed suicide.

302
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,796
He hung himself

303
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,898
from the second-story balcony.

304
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:39,303
It's a tragically
romantic love story.

305
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,737
This is their dog, Hallie.

306
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:43,840
She's the only remaining member
of the Harmon family.

307
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:44,974
I've adopted her.

308
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:48,311
Well, at least
they weren't murdered.

309
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,613
Mrs. Ramos.

310
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,949
Yes? I'd be happy to
show you another house.

311
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,483
But no matter where you go,

312
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,385
you'll be moving into
somebody's history.

313
00:16:57,452 --> 00:16:59,621
Only this one can be had for

314
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:03,658
$200,000 less than
the last time I sold it.

315
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:08,663
What do you think, Gabe?

316
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:10,098
I don't believe in ghosts.
Ah.

317
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,901
Of course he would say that.

318
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,336
Should we continue the tour?

319
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:17,305
Yes. Sure.

320
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:20,341
I know you're going
to love the kitchen.

321
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:21,876
It's got
marble countertops,

322
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:23,778
a breakfast nook,

323
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:26,380
and have you ever
seen a pasta arm?

324
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:27,882
No.
No.

325
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,917
Personally, I
haven't... I live alone...

326
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:33,854
but Mrs. Harmon fancied
herself a bit of a gourmet.

327
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,756
Notice the gazebo
in the backyard.

328
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,150
Ow.

329
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:17,432
You okay?

330
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,303
Yeah.

331
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,141
I-I slipped.

332
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,576
Where-where's Mom?

333
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:27,611
Oh, the second she stepped
foot in the kitchen,

334
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,746
it was game over.

335
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:30,749
I think we just bought
ourselves a house.

336
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:32,985
Come on, you gotta check out
the rest of this place.

337
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,850
There's definitely room
for a pool table.

338
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:40,960
Imagine sipping a nice
mojito on a hot summer day.

339
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:43,730
I guess you folks tolerate
the heat better than us gringos.

340
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,598
Am I right?

341
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:04,952
I see you've got a new family
moving in next door.

342
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,976
Yes, I noted that.

343
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,796
Oh, I do hope they're
a... nice family.

344
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:14,722
I'd go over there
and welcome them personally,

345
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:18,280
but as you may imagine,
returning to that house

346
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,670
is difficult for me.

347
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:21,765
After what I saw.

348
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:26,070
You stupid son of a bitch.

349
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:34,811
Please tell me that you're not
here with any more bad news.

350
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,914
No real news, actually.

351
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:39,083
So you still haven't found
that precious baby?

352
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:41,920
No trace.
That's very... worrying.

353
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:43,955
We'd like to go over
your statement again.

354
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,858
Just to make sure we
didn't miss anything.

355
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:50,028
Of course. You said you'd gone over
to the Harmons' at approximately

356
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,396
7:30 p.m.

357
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:52,931
To check on Dr. Harmon

358
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,366
and his daughter.

359
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:57,036
After ringing the bell and
getting no response, you decided

360
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:58,137
to enter the premises.

361
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:01,774
Being no stranger to tragedy,

362
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:03,742
I was understandably concerned.

363
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,112
Prescient, as it turned out.

364
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,208
You stupid son of a bitch.

365
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:13,417
I can't believe she killed me.

366
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,586
Serves you right.

367
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:19,722
My first instinct was to flee.

368
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,792
To run screaming
and never return.

369
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,193
But then I tenhought of the bab.

370
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:26,244
Shit.

371
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,841
Dad?

372
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:40,446
Well, that's all very touching.

373
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,615
But where the hell's the baby?

374
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:47,652
So I went searching for
the Harmons' daughter.

375
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,121
<i>And when I discovered</i>

376
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:52,223
that she was gone, too...

377
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,058
I understood
what must have happened.

378
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:02,665
Have you come to see my baby?

379
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,234
I've come to fch my grandson.

380
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:06,569
Oh, you think so?

381
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:09,138
Mrs. Harmon agrees with me.

382
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:12,241
House of the dead is no
place to raise a child.

383
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:13,809
It is for this baby.

384
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:15,778
He's special.
He's mine.

385
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:17,713
Over my dead body.

386
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:19,114
We're well past that.

387
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:23,863
Aw, shit.

388
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,259
Violet took that child,
and fled.

389
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:33,595
God knows where.

390
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:35,563
But I keep them both

391
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,765
in my prayers, every night.

392
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,669
Well...

393
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:49,911
If you, uh, think of anything
Violet said to you

394
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:52,948
that could, uh, indicate
where she might have gone,

395
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:54,049
you will let us know?

396
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:55,318
Oh, without hesitation.

397
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:00,223
Thank you for your time.

398
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:16,306
Aw...

399
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:21,211
Who's my good little angel, huh?

400
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:24,114
Who's my good little angel?

401
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:26,050
Oh..Oh

402
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:30,455
Oh, there's my good
little angel.

403
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:31,857
Huh?

404
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:38,130
Who are you?

405
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,101
You have awful taste in music.

406
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,036
Butthole Surfers?

407
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:45,739
Hello? Breaking
and entering.

408
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:47,141
Who are you?

409
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,575
A ghost of my former self.

410
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:52,179
Violet. I live
in the neighborhood.

411
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,816
Your hand's cold.

412
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,718
You know what they say.

413
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:58,919
Cold hands, warm heart.

414
00:22:58,987 --> 00:23:00,988
Hmm.

415
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:03,023
Yo!
Don't you have any Ramones?

416
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,891
Like <i>Animal Boy,</i>
or <i>Too Tough To Die?</i>

417
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,359
Hey. Get out of my room.

418
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,361
Are you sure
you want to be alone?

419
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,598
They say this house is haunted.

420
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,068
You're kind of
twisted, aren't you?

421
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:16,704
You don't know the half of it.

422
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,789
Whoa.
You okay?

423
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:35,891
Yeah. This floor is warped.

424
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,792
You know who's warped?

425
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,093
That realtor, Marcy.

426
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:40,995
You think?
I think she's hot.

427
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:42,930
Red hot.

428
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:45,466
Smokin' hot.

429
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:46,767
Really?
Mm.

430
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:48,836
I may have to waste
that bitch, then.

431
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:52,040
Hey. There's enough
of me to go around.

432
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:54,408
Well, I'm not into

433
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,476
sharing.

434
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:58,278
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

435
00:23:58,346 --> 00:23:59,980
Are we gonna christen
the house tonight?

436
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:03,423
Hmm.

437
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:08,256
Does this answer your question?

438
00:24:08,324 --> 00:24:09,758
Mmm.

439
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:11,560
This does.

440
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:18,735
Babe...

441
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,103
Gabe's upstairs.

442
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,005
Shh.

443
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:31,782
I remember when
we were like that.

444
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,517
In the beginning.

445
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:38,521
Mmm.

446
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:44,861
To be continued.

447
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,497
Uh-huh.

448
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:49,232
On that note.

449
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,467
Yes?

450
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:53,671
Gabe's graduating this year.

451
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:56,174
This house is so big.

452
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:57,943
Do you think we'll be lonely?

453
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,981
A baby?

454
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:04,884
Don't you think I'm too old?

455
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:07,152
Almost. Almost.
Aw.

456
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,587
So we should get going.

457
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:16,128
I lost two babies in this house.

458
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:18,563
One of them
never even took a breath,

459
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:21,065
and Constance stole
the other one.

460
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,834
At least he's out of this house.
They seem like

461
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,903
such a nice couple.

462
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,240
They can't have a baby
in this house.

463
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:29,275
You're right.

464
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:30,944
We have to do something.

465
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:34,481
You're going to need help.

466
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:38,952
Some spirits in the house
are angry and vengeful,

467
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,156
and eager to inflict
their fate on others.

468
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:46,126
But many of us are innocent,
kind, blameless victims

469
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:48,862
at the hands of another.

470
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,332
And we don't want to see
more suffering in this house.

471
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,989
What were you
dreaming about?

472
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,208
Shit!

473
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:08,163
Bet I know.

474
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,352
I'd dream about her, too,
if I could dream.

475
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,021
I don't think I do anymore.

476
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:18,217
The hell?
Who are you?

477
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,551
What are you doing in my room?

478
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:21,766
This used to be my room.

479
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,365
And then it was hers.

480
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:25,153
What are you talking about?

481
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:28,044
Violet.

482
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:31,828
She was my girlfriend.

483
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:33,297
The freaky chick from before?

484
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:35,101
What do you mean by freaky?

485
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:37,309
She seemed really cool.
Nothing happened.

486
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:41,489
She didn't say
she had a boyfriend.

487
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:42,950
We kind of broke up.

488
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:47,796
Right.
Well, I mean,

489
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:49,473
it's totally hands off,
dude. I get it.

490
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,847
No...

491
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,799
I don't think you do.

492
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:59,030
Shit!

493
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:00,427
Mom?!

494
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,516
Oh, my God!

495
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:09,888
Miguel! Miguel!

496
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:23,183
Miguel!

497
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:25,774
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.

498
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:31,610
Get away from me!

499
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:34,038
Get away from me!

500
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,102
Get away!

501
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:38,372
No! You stay here!
What do you want?!

502
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:40,920
Gabe!

503
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,155
Gabe! Gabe?!

504
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,391
Gabe!

505
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:46,625
Why?!

506
00:28:47,996 --> 00:28:50,031
Why?!

507
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,646
Why?!

508
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,458
I want her to be happy.

509
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:55,758
She liked you, I could tell.

510
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:57,594
You're a good guy, right?
What?

511
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:58,942
I mean,
you got all these friends

512
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,501
and you played some sports.

513
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,161
You make good grades, right?

514
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:03,138
Average.

515
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:04,255
Average is good.

516
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:06,140
Normal is good.

517
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:08,032
She deserves normal.

518
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:09,396
Get out of my way!

519
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,324
I don't want to hurt you!

520
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:18,853
Though I do have to kill you.

521
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,059
Miguel...

522
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,202
it's time for you
to open your eyes

523
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:31,180
and see what this place
is, what it can do.

524
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:34,325
I need someone to feel my pain.

525
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:40,224
Let me lead you.

526
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,575
Look what he did to me.

527
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,234
Why are you doing this?

528
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:05,107
Please, I told you, man,
nothing happened!

529
00:30:11,748 --> 00:30:14,216
Could you maybe not look at me?

530
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:15,618
- What?
- I mean, could you...

531
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:17,987
could you, like, stand up or...

532
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:20,589
I don't know, turn around
or something?!

533
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,328
Please...

534
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:28,429
don't kill me.

535
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:29,864
Oh, it's nothing personal.

536
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:33,000
It's just that she's all alone.

537
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:35,736
And that's not right!
Stand up!

538
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,804
<i>Padre.</i>

539
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,706
Stop that, stop
that. Come on.

540
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:41,875
Turn around.

541
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:45,335
Naughty boy.

542
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,302
What would Stacy think?

543
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,474
Oh, God, I'm dreaming.

544
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:06,899
You're wide awake.

545
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:09,068
Oh, God!

546
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,880
God!

547
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:34,630
Miguel!

548
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,357
Stacy!

549
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:40,250
Stacy?

550
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,567
Miguel!
Stacy!

551
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,074
Leave her alone!

552
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,208
Hey, stop!

553
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:53,973
You sick, perverted bastard.

554
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:55,503
They're barely moved in,

555
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,281
you're already preying
on the new meat?

556
00:31:57,342 --> 00:31:58,809
Who the hell are you people?

557
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,718
He used to be my husband.

558
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:11,368
You have no idea how long
I've been wanting to do that.

559
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:18,183
You have no idea how
long I've wanted to do that.

560
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:30,706
This is what it does to you.

561
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:34,050
This house.

562
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,186
Run.

563
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:47,966
Tate, no.

564
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,168
Put down the knife, Tate.

565
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:50,569
I can't.

566
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:54,106
I'm doing this for you.

567
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:55,441
I couldn't save you.

568
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,609
It's my fault you're alone.

569
00:32:57,677 --> 00:33:00,312
But I'm not alone.
My family's here now.

570
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,480
It's not enough.

571
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:02,481
You need someone.

572
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:03,715
Not him.

573
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:04,883
Then what do you want?!

574
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:07,419
What I wanted was you.

575
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,665
You told me to go away.

576
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:21,368
Yeah...

577
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:24,372
but I never said good-bye.

578
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,882
Come let me say good-bye.

579
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,001
Good-bye, Tate.

580
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,186
Gabe! Gabe, come on!

581
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,736
Come on, come on, come on.

582
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:36,679
Some other poor family's
just gonna move in here.

583
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:46,022
Suckers who will have no
idea what they're in for.

584
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,825
And we know exactly what to do.

585
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:05,708
Our tour concludes
with one of the most famous

586
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,896
houses of horror
in the City of Angels.

587
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:11,825
And the recent and bloody
tragedy of the Harmon family...

588
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:13,107
No, there's nothing to see here.

589
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:14,383
Only adds to the infamy of

590
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:16,075
the Murder House!

591
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:17,865
I have to sell this house.

592
00:35:17,903 --> 00:35:19,240
Get out of here!

593
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:21,815
It's enough already!

594
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,984
Now I have to sell this house!

595
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:25,919
Have you got a minute?

596
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:30,392
I know. I'm the last person
you want to see right now.

597
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:31,964
You're not a person.

598
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:34,463
You're a monster.

599
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:37,299
I really miss our talks, Ben.

600
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,701
They were really helping me.

601
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:40,636
Bullshit.

602
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,638
You're a psychopath, Tate.

603
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:45,641
It's a mental disorder,
and therapy can't cure it.

604
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,976
So that's your diagnosis?
I'm a psychopath?

605
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:49,211
Yep, and the worst kind.

606
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:51,180
You're charismatic
and compelling

607
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:52,714
and a pathological liar.

608
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:54,650
But don't listen to me.
I'm a total fraud.

609
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:57,853
And by the way,
therapy doesn't work.

610
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:59,521
It doesn't work?
Then why do people do it?

611
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:00,889
Because they don't want

612
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:03,592
to take any responsibility
for their crappy lives!

613
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,262
So they pay a therapist
to listen to their bullshit

614
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,666
and make it all feel... special.

615
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,267
So they can blame
their crazy mothers

616
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:14,102
for everything that went wrong.

617
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,838
Sound familiar?

618
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:19,708
It's a great racket, too.

619
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:21,310
Week after week,

620
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:22,978
month after month,
year after year

621
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:25,879
we collect checks, but deep down
we know it doesn't work.

622
00:36:26,122 --> 00:36:28,451
You son of a bitch.

623
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,401
We're not so different, Tate.

624
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,145
I'm a bad person, too.

625
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:39,788
I hurt the people I was
supposed to... love the most.

626
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:42,044
But they forgave you, right?

627
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,369
Maybe Violet
will forgive me, too.

628
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:45,915
She can't.
You can only forgive someone

629
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:48,047
for what they've done
to you directly.

630
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:53,075
Those people you murdered?

631
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,910
They're the only ones
who can forgive you,

632
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:57,880
and you took away their chance.

633
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:00,249
So this is it?

634
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:03,818
There's no...
there's nothing I can do?

635
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,440
There's no chance of mercy?

636
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:14,697
Terrific performance, Tate.

637
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:19,268
The whole misunderstood kid
act? Oh...

638
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:21,370
I fell for it, Violet did, too.

639
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:25,006
But a psychopath, by definition,
is incapable

640
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:26,975
of remorse.

641
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:28,443
So, come on, let's
try this again

642
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:31,079
for real this time.

643
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:32,435
You...

644
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,572
destroyed everything
that mattered most to me.

645
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,913
What could you possibly
want from me now?

646
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,160
I don't know about definitions,
but I really am sorry, Ben.

647
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:48,528
To you more than anyone.

648
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:49,599
Sorrys are easy.

649
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,255
What about taking responsibility
for the things you've done?

650
00:37:56,671 --> 00:38:01,041
Christ, you can't even
say the words.

651
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,927
In 1994...

652
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:10,417
I set my mom's boyfriend
on fire...

653
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:14,406
and then I shot and killed
15 kids at Westfield High.

654
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,591
I murdered the gay couple

655
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:17,759
who lived here before you...

656
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:21,563
and I raped your wife.

657
00:38:22,243 --> 00:38:23,932
There were other things, too.

658
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,400
Other people I hurt.

659
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:27,613
I'll tell you everything.

660
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:32,841
I'm not your priest, Tate.

661
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:35,877
I can't absolve you
for any of this.

662
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:39,079
Right, I get that.

663
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,281
But can you just...

664
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:46,431
hang out with me sometimes?

665
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,346
Hello?

666
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:25,209
Hello?

667
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,700
Oh, thank God you're here.

668
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,341
I'm so exhausted.

669
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:31,567
You're the new nanny?

670
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:33,035
Hello?

671
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,108
Nora?
Mrs. Montgomery, please.

672
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,609
Mother taught me that's
a rule to live by:

673
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,380
Never allow the help to call you
by your first name, so...

674
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,915
Is that my ba...

675
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,890
Uh, forgive me,
Mrs. Montgomery.

676
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,192
I would have come sooner,
but I...

677
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,395
I didn't think he made it;
I thought he was stillborn.

678
00:39:57,463 --> 00:39:59,164
Nearly.

679
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,734
He made one tiny little cry
and then passed on.

680
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:05,270
Apparently, I'm the only one who
witnessed it; Charles didn't.

681
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:06,071
Genius.

682
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,474
He's an unhappy child,
I'll tell you that.

683
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,648
Oh, it's you...
the birth mother.

684
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:19,117
Perhaps it was
your poor nutrition or just your

685
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:20,819
genetic inferiority.
In any case,

686
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:22,854
I'm quite dissatisfied.
He's a weakling.

687
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:27,091
Well, his lungs are strong;
I could hear him upstairs.

688
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,526
May I?

689
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,860
No, hands off!

690
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,030
You people... you think you
can just show up and claim

691
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,366
some sort of birthright,
but arrangements were made.

692
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,334
This baby is mine.

693
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,502
I understand.

694
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:44,372
But I do know some...
some tricks that might

695
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,544
be helpful to quiet him down.

696
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:08,801
What do you call him?

697
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:11,003
Little Noisy Monster.

698
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:13,672
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

699
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:36,944
Oh, thank God.

700
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:39,631
I was actually afraid

701
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:42,168
I might harm him
if he didn't quiet down.

702
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:45,638
He has been inconsolable
for days and days.

703
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:46,773
I am so exhausted.

704
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:50,887
Oh, dear, I think
I might need to...

705
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:54,747
take a rest.

706
00:41:57,573 --> 00:41:59,229
Perhaps you could keep him
for the night.

707
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,223
You take a rest, Mrs. Montgomery.
You need a nice rest.

708
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:04,892
We'll be fine.

709
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:20,107
I'm not entirely sure I have
the patience to be a mother.

710
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:23,978
Probably all of
those hideous nannies.

711
00:42:24,046 --> 00:42:27,548
Mother wasn't very good at
it either, truth be told.

712
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:34,216
Are you gonna be a Nicholas?

713
00:42:35,223 --> 00:42:37,029
Or a Jonah?

714
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,895
Or a Jeffrey?

715
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:44,200
Are you gonna be
a little Jeffrey?

716
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:47,856
Who are you gonna be,
little guy?

717
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:52,175
Moira, what are you doing?

718
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:54,736
Scouring the cinets
with vinegar, Mrs. Harmon.

719
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:58,246
I... I just noticed how sticky they
were when the new family moved out.

720
00:42:58,314 --> 00:42:59,781
I don't know what else
to do with myself.

721
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:03,152
Cleaning is what I'm good at,
so I'll just carry on.

722
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,820
Sorry, Moira.

723
00:43:04,888 --> 00:43:06,474
Look who I found.

724
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,393
He was in the basement.

725
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,128
He was down there with Nora,
wouldn't stop crying.

726
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:14,563
I knew she couldn't handle him.

727
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,665
She doesn't really want a baby.

728
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:18,868
She just got
stuck on that idea.

729
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:21,837
Not a motherly bone
in her body, that one.

730
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:23,039
Do you want to hold him?

731
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,080
Here you go.

732
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,490
He's such a frail little thing.

733
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:43,859
His skin is like peaches.

734
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:45,794
I would have made
a good mother,

735
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:49,097
if I hadn't been
such a little tramp.

736
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:50,565
Forgive me.

737
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:53,334
There's nothing worse than
a self-pitying old maid.

738
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:59,306
You know, I'm gonna need
so much help with him.

739
00:43:59,374 --> 00:44:02,843
I can't accept such a position.
I'm not trained as a nanny.

740
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,978
I wasn't thinking that you
would come work for us.

741
00:44:06,546 --> 00:44:09,849
I was gonna ask you if you
wanted to be his godmother.

742
00:44:16,075 --> 00:44:18,423
If that'd make
you feel safer...

743
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:25,414
I think you'd be a great
addition to the family.

744
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:34,240
I found these in the attic.

745
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:36,509
Wow.

746
00:44:36,577 --> 00:44:37,577
These ornaments are ancient.

747
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:39,699
I suppose they are.

748
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,248
You'll come to understand,
Violet,

749
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:44,317
that the word "ancient"
will lose all its meaning

750
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:48,054
when your entire existence
is one long today.

751
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:51,023
Okay, everybody ready?

752
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:55,995
Look at that.

753
00:44:56,062 --> 00:44:59,297
I chopped it down myself,
I'm proud to say.

754
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,002
Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful?

755
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,372
I have!

756
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,175
Look at him.
He's so amazing.

757
00:45:10,243 --> 00:45:11,576
Oh!

758
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:13,679
Best temperament.
Hardly ever cries.

759
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:15,348
Looks like his daddy.

760
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:21,255
Want to hold him?
Mm-hmm.

761
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:22,956
Here you go.

762
00:45:33,002 --> 00:45:36,229
I didn't think it was
possible for me, Vivien...

763
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:39,374
but I'm happy.

764
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,092
Grow a pair, Rimbaud.

765
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,794
She's not into you.

766
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:00,862
You're not getting
back into her.

767
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,764
She'll never talk to you again.

768
00:46:02,832 --> 00:46:04,364
I'll wait.

769
00:46:05,774 --> 00:46:08,298
Forever, if I have to.

770
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:15,308
Ding-dong!

771
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,910
How would you feel

772
00:46:16,978 --> 00:46:18,745
about working
a miracle today, Helen?

773
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:21,914
Constance, you get your ass
in my chair!

774
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:23,516
Oh, where you been, girl?

775
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:25,918
I was starting to think you
found yourself another salon.

776
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:29,055
Oh, heavens no, no, no, no!

777
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:32,492
No, I've just been a bit
housebound of late.

778
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,228
Now, don't shriek when
this scarf comes off.

779
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:39,767
Lady Clairol and I have become
entirely too familiar.

780
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:41,435
Housebound?
You have an accident?

781
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:42,403
No.

782
00:46:43,906 --> 00:46:45,606
I had a baby.

783
00:46:45,674 --> 00:46:47,174
A... a baby?

784
00:46:47,242 --> 00:46:48,142
A boy.

785
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,244
A son!

786
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:54,514
Oh, I... No, I-I didn't give
birth to him, of course.

787
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,949
No, he was the, um...

788
00:46:57,017 --> 00:47:00,552
child of distant cousins
on my mother's side.

789
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,921
The DeLongprees of Virginia.

790
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:04,188
Evaline and Steve.

791
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:05,623
They died tragically

792
00:47:05,691 --> 00:47:08,126
in a highway accident
outside Richmond,

793
00:47:08,194 --> 00:47:10,262
leaving that poor
little angel an orphan.

794
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,231
Terrible.

795
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:15,735
Yes, but little Michael and I
were meant to be together.

796
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:17,504
He was meant to be my son.

797
00:47:17,571 --> 00:47:19,906
And I, his mother.

798
00:47:19,974 --> 00:47:21,374
And I am sick

799
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:23,277
of looking like his grandmother.
Oh!

800
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:27,414
So... here.
You work your magic.

801
00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:32,386
Oh!

802
00:47:34,255 --> 00:47:36,290
Oh, Helen!

803
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:38,691
Oh, you truly are an artist.

804
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:41,660
Well, even an artist needs
the right materials.

805
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,161
Oh!

806
00:47:43,229 --> 00:47:45,697
You know, Constance, in all
the years I've known you,

807
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:49,768
I don't think you have ever
looked younger or more radiant.

808
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:52,238
It's true, isn't it?

809
00:47:52,305 --> 00:47:53,739
May I confide something?

810
00:47:53,807 --> 00:47:55,875
Yeah.

811
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:58,478
Ever since I was a little girl,

812
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:02,550
I knew I was destined
for great things.

813
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:05,453
I was gonna be somebody...

814
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:08,056
a person of...

815
00:48:08,123 --> 00:48:10,758
significance.

816
00:48:10,825 --> 00:48:13,732
A star of the silver screen,
I once thought.

817
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:19,967
But...

818
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:22,434
my dreams became nightmares.

819
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:26,973
Instead of laurels...

820
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:28,656
funeral wreathes.

821
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:31,831
Instead of glory...

822
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,298
bitter disappointment,

823
00:48:36,384 --> 00:48:38,118
cruel afflictions.

824
00:48:38,186 --> 00:48:40,955
Well, now I understand

825
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:45,935
tragedy was preparing me...

826
00:48:46,495 --> 00:48:48,341
for something greater.

827
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:55,740
Every loss that came before
was a lesson.

828
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:00,108
I was being prepared.

829
00:49:01,343 --> 00:49:03,056
And now I know for what.

830
00:49:06,948 --> 00:49:09,049
This child.

831
00:49:10,558 --> 00:49:13,779
A remarkable boy.

832
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:18,524
Destined for greatness!

833
00:49:20,994 --> 00:49:24,228
In need of a remarkable mother.

834
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:28,066
Someone forged in the fires
of adversity...

835
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:31,779
who can guide him...

836
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:37,776
with wisdom,

837
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:39,599
with firmness.

838
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:44,883
With love.

839
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:49,620
I apologize for being
so late, Flora.

840
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,309
But Helen had to go
into minute detail

841
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:56,594
every tiresome moment
of her niece's Bat Mitzvah.

842
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:58,829
The amount of money those people

843
00:49:58,897 --> 00:50:01,529
throw away
on a 13-year-old is...

844
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,083
Flora?

845
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:00,096
Hey...

846
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:04,901
Now what am I gonna do with you?

847
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:09,004
