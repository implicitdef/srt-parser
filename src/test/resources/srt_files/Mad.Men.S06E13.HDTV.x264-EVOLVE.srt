1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,605
I don't know anything about you.

2
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:02,986
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

3
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:05,515
I'm so sorry...
but you can't do this.

4
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:07,248
But I'm his father.

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:10,891
Find a way to get your
friend out of my mother's life.

6
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:12,996
Manolo doesn't like women.

7
00:00:13,257 --> 00:00:14,750
There's this opportunity...

8
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:16,538
I guess you should have
Brooks talk to me about it.

9
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:17,946
Daddy!

10
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:19,599
Tell him, Ted.

11
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:21,673
I'm not sure I know
what you mean.

12
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:24,311
Crane called from Los Angeles.

13
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:26,608
Sunkist finally embraced
a television campaign

14
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,410
of $8 million.

15
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,812
It's a great account.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,883
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

17
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,268
- Morning.
- Don.

18
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,504
Can I have a moment?

19
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:27,745
I know you're deciding
who's gonna be on Sunkist,

20
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,347
so I wanted to volunteer.

21
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,182
You want to go?

22
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,784
You know that's a demotion.

23
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:35,186
You're gonna be in one
room with one account.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,756
Thought about that, but rather than
just being a satellite office,

25
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,626
I was thinking I could
turn it into a little agency.

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,228
Los Angeles is not what
you see in the movies.

27
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:46,130
It's like Detroit
with palm trees.

28
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:47,799
So it's the frontier.

29
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:48,967
I don't even need
running water.

30
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,468
Just let me set up
the homestead.

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,437
You think you're asking
for a promotion,

32
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:55,874
but if you fail there,
you'll be out of advertising

33
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,542
because no one
takes it seriously.

34
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,144
All I'm saying is that
I think it'd be exciting

35
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:03,414
to build one desk
into a real business.

36
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,216
That's not the way I saw it.

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,351
That's not the way you saw <i>me.</i>

38
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:09,687
And you're gonna change that.

39
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:17,795
I've always felt you learn more from
disappointment than you do from success.

40
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,331
Well, I suppose I'm
becoming a very wise man.

41
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:22,700
- Hello, Daddy.
- How you doing, sweetie?

42
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:26,971
Oh? Wow.

43
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:29,007
He did get my good side.

44
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,875
He made it for
his generous Pop Pop.

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,544
Why don't we take you to lunch?

46
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,112
Come on, honey, I've taken
up enough of Dad's time.

47
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,952
I wanted to say thank you,

48
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,621
but obviously that
would be premature.

49
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:45,156
It's time to take a breather.

50
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,058
It's prudent investing,
it's not personal.

51
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:49,928
No, it is personal.
I'm your daughter.

52
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,764
What do I have to do to get on the
list of girls you give money to?

53
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,498
- Honey.
- Don't be a brat.

54
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:57,201
Brooks won't say it, but you're
taking food out of our mouths.

55
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:59,704
Don't even bother
to come to Thanksgiving.

56
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,405
The table will be empty.

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,808
Stop it.
I'll buy a turkey.

58
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:07,879
Sir, she doesn't mean it.

59
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:14,652
<i>Mr. Cosgrove is here.</i>

60
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,022
Send him in.

61
00:03:18,057 --> 00:03:20,157
Name a chocolate.

62
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,259
What, like Hershey's?

63
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:24,395
Kenny, there's a reason
I'm standing here.

64
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:27,765
Hershey's Chocolate sent an RFP
out to the top 30 agencies

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,167
and all anyone seems to care about
is that we're in the top 30.

66
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:31,903
Because Hershey's
isn't serious.

67
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:34,238
They don't advertise.
They never have.

68
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,474
Mars bills at 10 million.

69
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,676
We think Hershey's is asking for
someone to talk them into that.

70
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,379
- What did Ted say? - He said his
plate is full and yours isn't.

71
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:45,216
But if you want to take the lead
on this, I think he'll follow.

72
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:49,120
I love Hershey's.

73
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:50,588
Get me in a room.

74
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:52,824
I'll get you what they sent me.

75
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:04,869
How's the Motor City?

76
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:07,471
I found a deli, but the
airport's like Calcutta.

77
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:10,875
Should be easier once I get an
apartment and stop commuting.

78
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,944
It's a hell of an account.

79
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:14,478
Don't I know it.

80
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,050
You're back in one piece.

81
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,185
Oh, one bigger piece.
I'm putting on weight.

82
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,755
- No one can see it.
- What's that?

83
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,657
- It's a racehorse.
- It's for Kevin.

84
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,959
Don't do that. He's just
gonna want a real one.

85
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:30,594
We'll see.
They just gave Bob one.

86
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,830
Well, you know what
they say about Detroit.

87
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:35,767
It's all fun and games till
they shoot you in the face.

88
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,776
Aren't we going to have dinner?

89
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,477
Eventually.

90
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,713
I'm worried.
Now they sent a letter.

91
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,381
Sally has to call them.

92
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:53,617
I'll talk to her
at Thanksgiving.

93
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:56,120
I told you,
we just have the boys.

94
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:58,556
Miss Porter's doesn't have
Thanksgiving vacation.

95
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,758
I read the letter.

96
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:02,760
The next step is a subpoena.

97
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,396
Okay.

98
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,031
Hello.

99
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,437
You can have <i>one.</i>
Then we're having dinner.

100
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,606
Sounds like a plan.

101
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,138
_

102
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,852
Could you get
Bob Benson for me?

103
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:34,025
<i>Bob Benson's here to see you.</i>

104
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:36,694
Really?
Send him in.

105
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,497
Were you circling my office?

106
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:43,101
- I don't understand.
- Sit down.

107
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,573
It occurred to me that you haven't
had a performance review.

108
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,575
Yes, I did. Didn't
Mr. Cutler tell you--

109
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,944
I don't give a shit.

110
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,879
You have a hand on
every rung, don't you?

111
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:57,615
I don't think I know
what you're talking about.

112
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,017
What are you doing
buying presents for that kid?

113
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,854
Leading that woman on? That's
another man's kid. You know that?

114
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,189
I assure you, I'm not
involved with Joan.

115
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:06,858
We're just buddies.

116
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:09,093
Joan's known for
having a lot of buddies.

117
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,461
They go fishing together.

118
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,663
What does this have to do
with my performance?

119
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:15,666
I'm asking the questions here.
I see what you're up to.

120
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,137
Look, I know that you're
concerned with your career

121
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,172
and Chevy's counting on you
being a family man,

122
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,141
but playing with
Mrs. Harris' feelings

123
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,509
is not the right way
to go about it.

124
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:29,080
- You're right.
- Damn it, Bob, I better not be.

125
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,015
I'm keeping an eye on you.

126
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,451
I appreciate your candor.

127
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,688
I'm looking forward to having
you out in Detroit, Bob.

128
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,258
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

129
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,634
This is Sally Draper speaking.

130
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:52,670
It's Daddy.

131
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,072
What do you want?

132
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,975
I wanted to wish you
a happy Thanksgiving.

133
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,077
Okay.
I have to go.

134
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:03,014
Also, I'm calling
because--

135
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,283
well, I know it's unpleasant,

136
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:08,385
but you have to give a statement
regarding the burglar.

137
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,923
<i>You need to make arrangements to
be out of classes December 1st.</i>

138
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:13,490
My calendar is full.

139
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:16,894
Honey, you have to.
It's the law.

140
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,897
Well, I wouldn't want
to do anything immoral.

141
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:21,632
You know what?

142
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,734
Why don't you just
tell them what I saw?

143
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,637
Hello?

144
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:39,450
I've got it, Moira.
I have a personal plea.

145
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:41,152
Is this about Hershey again?

146
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:43,420
No, the folks from
Sheraton are in the lobby.

147
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:47,925
Royal Hawaiian.
We can't find Draper.

148
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,027
Again?

149
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,633
<i>You don't have to listen,
but I have to say it.</i>

150
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:58,903
<i>We're all brothers in Christ.</i>

151
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,938
That's His gift to us.

152
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:04,342
We're talking about a fellowship
far more powerful than drink.

153
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:07,511
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to drink.

154
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,414
What's your occupation,
young man?

155
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,217
Staying out
of people's business.

156
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:16,153
You're not doing
a very good job of it.

157
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,826
I didn't mean to engage you.

158
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,661
But you did.

159
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,530
'Cause something's
on your mind.

160
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,599
You need to talk.

161
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,301
I don't.

162
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,570
What if I told you

163
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:36,874
that Jesus could offer you
not only eternal life,

164
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,843
but freedom from pain
in this life?

165
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,946
I'm doing just fine.

166
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,915
Nixon's the president.

167
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:45,716
Everything's back
where Jesus wants it.

168
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,019
He doesn't work that way.

169
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:50,687
'Cause He's mysterious.

170
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,823
He offer the same deal
to Kennedy?

171
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,793
Martin Luther King?
Vietnam, for Christ's sake?

172
00:08:57,762 --> 00:09:01,332
Studies show Jesus
had a bad year.

173
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:05,303
Well, I'm afraid there's not one
true believer in that list.

174
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,339
What the hell did you just say?

175
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:11,208
I told you before to get
out and not come back.

176
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:13,911
- Be on your way.
- This is a house of sin.

177
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:16,113
You can't keep these girls
from the righteous path.

178
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,182
- They belong to the Lord.
- You're wrong on that.

179
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:21,118
You love the Bible 'cause you
can't get your dick hard.

180
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:23,187
Repentance is your salvation.

181
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:26,757
I'd tell you to go to hell, but
I never want to see you again.

182
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,331
The only unpardonable sin

183
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,533
is to believe God
cannot forgive you.

184
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,057
Excuse me.
Hey.

185
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,793
- I shouldn't be in here.
<i>- You're right.</i>

186
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:05,162
<i>You punched a minister.</i>
<i>You should be in Rikers.</i>

187
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:07,731
<i>Sleep it off.</i>

188
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:19,610
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

189
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,078
<i>You'll have candy</i>
<i>at the theater.</i>

190
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:24,148
- Oh, hello, Peggy.
- Hello.

191
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:27,251
Good night.

192
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:29,220
Come on, boys.
Let's go.

193
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,128
Clara, I'm going to give
my keys to the subletter.

194
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,529
Did you get me a room
at the Roosevelt?

195
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,164
Yes, and you just got
this telegram.

196
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:41,732
Open it.

197
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,868
Let's see.

198
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:47,704
"Need to inform you,
mother lost at--"

199
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:51,742
Oh, my goodness.
She fell off a ship!

200
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,411
What?

201
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,214
Get Bud on the phone.

202
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,909
_

203
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,604
I assume this has something
to do with last night.

204
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,941
Yes.

205
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,413
Megan, I--

206
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,585
Come over here.

207
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,325
Where were you?

208
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,131
I spent the night in jail.

209
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,467
Why are you laughing?

210
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:51,537
Because I realized

211
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:53,405
it's gotten out of control.

212
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,842
I've gotten out of control.

213
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,413
Sorry you had to
find out that way.

214
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:05,484
But I realized
something else, too.

215
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,620
I don't want
to be here anymore.

216
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,457
- It'll get easier.
- No.

217
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,560
I want to move to California.

218
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,163
What?

219
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:19,699
I don't want you to
give up your career.

220
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,567
I don't want you to think that.

221
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,904
I just can't be
in New York anymore.

222
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:28,041
I want to move to LA.

223
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,476
I don't--

224
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,245
I don't know what to say.

225
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,349
There have been all these
opportunities in Hollywood,

226
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:40,286
but I never even considered it

227
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,322
because I thought it
would make you go crazy.

228
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:46,993
But-- I mean,
wouldn't it?

229
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,063
What would you do out there?

230
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:53,499
Sunkist wants us
to have someone local.

231
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:58,771
It could be like
having my own shop.

232
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:02,308
A small team, a desk,

233
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:05,745
windows, some sunlight,

234
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,347
the ocean.

235
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,516
You'd throw
everything away here?

236
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,318
No.

237
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:14,921
It's an opportunity

238
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:18,791
to build one desk

239
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:20,760
into an agency.

240
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:24,396
We'd be homesteaders.

241
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,901
Really, Don?

242
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:30,569
What about the kids?

243
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:34,974
I'm sure they'd trade weekends

244
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:37,643
for a whole summer in LA.

245
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:44,083
We were happy there.

246
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:50,389
We could be happy again.

247
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:57,596
Is that a yes?

248
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:10,943
This was to be
a junior position.

249
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:12,311
Look, I'm the search party

250
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:14,046
and I decided we were
thinking too small.

251
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,948
Well, I think we can spare you.

252
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,517
I apologize for Sheraton, Ted.

253
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,052
That won't happen again.

254
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:25,925
That's my recommendation.

255
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,060
Of course I welcome
a vote on the matter.

256
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,668
How is it every decision
made in this place

257
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,736
is subject to 10 opinions
unless it's him?

258
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:39,338
What if we need him here?

259
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,944
It's California, not the moon.

260
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:47,613
There are telephones
and airplanes.

261
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,548
You're already doing
the heavy lifting.

262
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:51,818
This is good for you, Ted.

263
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:58,557
Honestly, I have
bigger problems than this.

264
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:04,763
Dawn, could you bring me
a carton of cigarettes?

265
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,867
You didn't think ahead.

266
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:10,036
You let her go and yet
you still need something.

267
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,238
- She's not going anywhere.
- But you are.

268
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:15,407
California, here you come.

269
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,244
You probably dictated
the memo right to her

270
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,313
and had no idea
she'd be affected.

271
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,781
Hold on a second.

272
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:24,350
I was gonna talk to you.

273
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:27,286
Really? Why?
You don't owe me anything.

274
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,889
I can probably get you
out there eventually.

275
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:32,691
To work for you?
No, I'd rather stay here.

276
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,093
Where are you going?

277
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:36,762
I'm gonna have that
sandwich on my desk.

278
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:38,664
I need to get to it
before you do.

279
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:44,103
Are you kidding me?
They got married?

280
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:45,972
What the hell was he
even doing there?

281
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,440
You should really get going.

282
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:51,744
You tell those Panamanian criminals they
should put Manolo under house arrest.

283
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:53,679
Or ship's arrest
or whatever it's called.

284
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,581
Fine, the brig.

285
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:57,850
Do whatever it takes.

286
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:00,452
- What's wrong?
- Get me Bob Benson this minute.

287
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:02,755
He was waiting for you. You're
late for your flight to Detroit.

288
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,067
Hold that.

289
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:19,171
- How are you?
- Not great, Bob.

290
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,440
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

291
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:23,609
Don't play dumb.

292
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:26,112
You don't know that your boyfriend
Manolo kidnapped my mother,

293
00:16:26,146 --> 00:16:28,414
married her at gunpoint,
then threw her off a ship?!

294
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,182
Slow down.

295
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:32,318
I know you're exaggerating
and you're being hostile.

296
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:34,053
If you want to run,
I'd do it now.

297
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:36,789
Because you're
an accessory to murder.

298
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:39,725
I will never, ever let this go.

299
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,928
Manny wouldn't hurt a fly.

300
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:43,662
Even if he thought it was rich?

301
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:54,673
I swear I knew
nothing about this.

302
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:57,743
Ignorance will not be
a very good defense.

303
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,916
Get your own cab.

304
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,766
I'm leaving a little early
because I have plans.

305
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,468
I hope that's okay.

306
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:26,973
Yes, of course, dear.

307
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,142
Chanel No. 5?

308
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,278
It's all I wear.

309
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,886
Vixen by night.

310
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:47,193
I'm very excited
to see the scale model.

311
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:49,862
And I'm even more excited
to go to the London Chop House.

312
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:51,530
Bob loves it.

313
00:17:51,564 --> 00:17:54,400
Well, unfortunately
Bob's not feeling well.

314
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,205
<i>Pete, have you seen</i>
<i>this beauty?</i>

315
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:03,109
No, not in the flesh.

316
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:05,444
That's a Camaro Z28.
Am I wrong?

317
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,912
No, you are not.

318
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:09,315
I like a man with
gasoline in his veins.

319
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:12,618
- You've got to try it.
- We can't do that in here.

320
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:14,786
I did.
Last week.

321
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,256
Shit, it's our floor. We can
do whatever the hell we want.

322
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,491
Keys are under the visor.

323
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,396
Go to town.

324
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,872
Bobby, you like to get
into trouble, don't you?

325
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,415
It's standard.

326
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:45,651
So is the solid-lifter
302 V-8.

327
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:53,325
Listen to that music.

328
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,928
That's good enough for me.

329
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:58,830
Ah, take it out.
Come on, boys, back up.

330
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:05,371
You looking for first?

331
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,206
It's written right on there.

332
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,075
I got it, Bob.

333
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:23,422
Jesus, you can't drive a stick?

334
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:25,324
We'll pay for that.

335
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,179
What are you doing here?

336
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,014
Waiting for you.

337
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,419
I told your neighbors
I was a cop.

338
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:49,456
You should go home
before they kill you.

339
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,725
I need to talk to you.

340
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:01,401
How was your date?

341
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,169
Is that why you're here?

342
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,104
I just want to know.

343
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,307
You didn't bring him home.

344
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,377
It was terrible, okay?

345
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:13,346
He works in finance
and ate with his hands.

346
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,282
Not that it's any
of your business.

347
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,618
I don't know what we're doing.

348
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:19,952
<i>You</i> don't know?

349
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,721
Why don't you have
your wife drop by again?

350
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:24,891
- I'd love that.
- She came in with the kids.

351
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:27,594
Why did she give me that
<i>look</i> on the way out?

352
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:30,463
Did you tell her something?
Do you two talk about me?

353
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:32,632
I don't know why
women do anything.

354
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,967
Why did you parade your ass
in front of my door

355
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,736
on your way out
to see another man?

356
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,172
I'm following your lead, Ted.

357
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:42,742
You let Don terrify you into
ignoring me and now you're here.

358
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:45,612
Because I don't want
anyone else to have you.

359
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:51,584
You should go.

360
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,026
Peggy, I'm going
to leave my wife.

361
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,629
Don't say that.

362
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,199
I'm not that girl.

363
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,936
I love you.

364
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,802
Hello?

365
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:45,104
I just got off the phone
with Miss Porter's.

366
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,240
Sally's been suspended.

367
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:49,843
What did she do?

368
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:53,446
She bought beer
using the name "Beth Francis"

369
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:55,815
with a false ID she'd made.

370
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:02,889
Kids do things, Betty. At least
they didn't kick her out.

371
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,724
Henry's already in Albany.

372
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,027
I'm supposed
to join him tomorrow.

373
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,431
I know you're picking
the boys up Thanksgiving Day,

374
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:12,866
but could you go
get her tomorrow?

375
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,802
<i>They're holding her</i>
<i>in the infirmary, I think.</i>

376
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,337
I don't want to have this
conversation with my mother-in-law.

377
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:23,476
I can't, Betty.
I have a big meeting.

378
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:25,244
She was drunk.

379
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,881
And she got other girls drunk.

380
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,916
I've done everything
I can think to do,

381
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,718
everything my own mother did,

382
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,487
<i>and it doesn't matter.</i>

383
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:36,923
The good is not
beating the bad.

384
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,563
She obviously needs
more than I can give her.

385
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,634
Birdie, this isn't your fault.

386
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:54,340
Don, she's from a broken home.

387
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,622
Pauline doesn't need to know.

388
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:12,291
I'll come get them
Thanksgiving morning

389
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,427
and then I'll come get her.

390
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,296
Okay.

391
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,701
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,910
Is everything okay?

393
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,311
No.

394
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,949
Is there anything I can do?

395
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,675
Let's go to Hawaii.

396
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:07,013
For work?

397
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,415
For Christmas.

398
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,484
We'll come back with tans.

399
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,659
You should probably go home.

400
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,063
I don't want to.

401
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:26,432
I can say I worked
late on Hershey.

402
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:32,705
Don't you always
go home, though?

403
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,580
I don't want to sneak around.

404
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,115
I promise we won't have to.

405
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,124
I don't want a scandal.

406
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,594
I can wait.

407
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,295
Go.

408
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,944
No, you should go.

409
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,698
Oh, good, you're home.

410
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,766
Yeah, I didn't want
to wake you.

411
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:35,367
<i>Come to bed.</i>

412
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,436
Okay.

413
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,549
Oh, sweetheart,
you're working too hard.

414
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,766
What are you doing back?

415
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,102
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

416
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,504
I need a place to live.

417
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,539
I spoke with the GM
personnel department.

418
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:16,275
No, here in New York.

419
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,911
I'm done in Detroit and the
tenant's already moved in.

420
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,147
Oh.

421
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:23,683
Your brother's been trying
desperately to reach you.

422
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,451
Did they find her?

423
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,691
Well, let him know I'm back.

424
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm gonna be gone
for a couple of hours.

425
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,703
Roger needs me to go to
the bank before the holiday.

426
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,171
You want someone on his desk?

427
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm not sure he's coming in.

428
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:50,943
- I'm worried about him.
- What's wrong?

429
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:53,512
For one thing, Margaret and the
son-in-law are bleeding him dry.

430
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:55,682
Trust me, he loves it.

431
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,784
Well, he's forlorn.

432
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,652
I'd invite him to my place
for Thanksgiving,

433
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:02,922
but Ralph stopped drinking and you
know little Ralphie's spastic.

434
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,424
I think both
are too much for him.

435
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:19,156
<i>Mr. Draper.</i>

436
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:21,058
<i>Mr. Chaough's here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

437
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:22,861
Send him in.

438
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:29,333
- I need to talk to you.
- I was thinking the same thing.

439
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:31,269
You should come to Hershey's
since I'm going to California.

440
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:32,737
That's not why I'm here.

441
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:35,273
Do you want something?

442
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,743
No, thank you.

443
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:46,584
I don't know how to say this,

444
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:49,353
but <i>I</i> want to go to California.

445
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:53,925
Really?
We can't both go.

446
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:57,495
I know.
I want you to stay here.

447
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,232
You put all that energy and
optimism back into the business

448
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,167
and let me go out there.

449
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:05,904
I'm the one who needs
to start over.

450
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:08,640
With Peggy?

451
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:13,344
No, with my family.

452
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:16,280
I don't understand.

453
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:18,516
Yes, you do.

454
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:22,053
It's my only chance, Don.

455
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:25,890
I've got kids.

456
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:28,392
I can't throw this away.
I can't--

457
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:32,597
I can't go on like this.

458
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,902
I'm sorry, Ted.
I wish I could help you.

459
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:42,406
I don't know what
I brought out in you,

460
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:45,710
but I know there's a
good man in there.

461
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:49,814
I need you to help me

462
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:51,783
put 3,000 miles
between me and her

463
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,317
or my life is over.

464
00:28:53,352 --> 00:28:55,787
I didn't make
my decision lightly.

465
00:28:56,989 --> 00:28:59,724
I need it, too.

466
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:03,227
And, frankly, they're writing
my wife off her show.

467
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:04,929
It's too late, Ted.

468
00:29:18,944 --> 00:29:20,512
It will go away.

469
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:25,249
Will you have a drink
before the meeting?

470
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:30,154
My father was-- you can't
stop cold like that.

471
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:01,586
Every agency you're going to
meet with feels qualified

472
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,354
to advertise the Hershey bar

473
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:05,723
because the product itself

474
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:08,826
is one of the most successful
billboards of all time.

475
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:11,228
<i>And its relationship</i>
<i>with America</i>

476
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:13,965
is so overwhelmingly positive

477
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:17,001
that everyone in this room
has their own story to tell.

478
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:20,638
It could be rations
in the heat of battle

479
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:22,373
or in the movie theater
on a first date.

480
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:25,743
<i>But most of them</i>
<i>are from childhood.</i>

481
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:27,845
Mine was my father

482
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,514
taking me to the drugstore
after I'd mowed the lawn

483
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:32,349
and telling me I could
have anything I wanted.

484
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:34,586
Anything at all.
And there was a lot.

485
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,621
But I picked a Hershey bar.

486
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:40,758
The wrapper looked like
what was inside.

487
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:43,294
And as I ripped it open,

488
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:45,730
my father tousled my hair
and forever

489
00:30:45,764 --> 00:30:48,365
his love and the chocolate

490
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,267
were tied together.

491
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:52,937
<i>That's the story</i>
<i>we're going to tell.</i>

492
00:30:52,972 --> 00:30:57,408
Hershey's is the currency
of affection.

493
00:30:57,442 --> 00:31:01,145
It's the childhood
symbol of love.

494
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,254
Well, weren't you
a lucky little boy?

495
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:14,525
Our company excels
in television

496
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,862
<i>and we'll tell you exactly when
and where to tell those stories.</i>

497
00:31:17,896 --> 00:31:20,665
<i>Sweet tales of childhood.</i>

498
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:24,201
<i>I suppose</i>
<i>we'd start with yours.</i>

499
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:26,638
<i>You can't just have that.
You got to pay us first.</i>

500
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:30,307
And that's what's so exciting.

501
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:34,545
I'm sorry, I have to say this

502
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,748
'cause I don't know
if I'll ever see you again.

503
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:40,217
What?

504
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,763
I was an orphan.

505
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:55,667
I grew up in Pennsylvania...

506
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:59,403
in a whorehouse.

507
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:06,477
I read about Milton Hershey
and his school

508
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:09,180
in "Coronet" magazine
or some other crap

509
00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:12,316
the girls left by the toilet.

510
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,754
And I read that some orphans

511
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,622
had a different life there.

512
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:22,426
I could picture it.

513
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,461
I dreamt of it--

514
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:27,231
of being wanted.

515
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:30,367
Because the woman
who was forced to raise me

516
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:32,003
would look at me every day

517
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:34,105
like she hoped
I would disappear.

518
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:40,511
Closest I got to feeling wanted

519
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:43,514
was from a girl

520
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:46,784
who made me go through
her john's pockets

521
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:48,986
while they screwed.

522
00:32:49,021 --> 00:32:52,590
If I collected more than a dollar,
she'd buy me a Hershey bar.

523
00:32:55,194 --> 00:32:58,996
And I would eat it alone

524
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:01,699
in my room

525
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:04,135
with great ceremony...

526
00:33:11,844 --> 00:33:14,345
feeling like a normal kid.

527
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:24,555
It said "Sweet" on the package.

528
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:33,831
It was the only
sweet thing in my life.

529
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:42,306
Do you want to advertise that?

530
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,176
If I had my way,
you would never advertise.

531
00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:48,345
You shouldn't have
someone like me

532
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,515
telling that boy
what a Hershey bar is.

533
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:53,851
He already knows.

534
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:03,327
Don's being modest.

535
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:05,263
But it's just this kind
of theater

536
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:07,131
that makes our work
so different.

537
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:10,401
Well, that's quite a story.

538
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,507
It was a pleasure meeting you.

539
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:19,177
We'd love to have a meal,

540
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:21,245
stop you from going to some
of these other meetings.

541
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,047
Ted...?

542
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:25,116
- It was a pleasure.
- Yes.

543
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:36,327
You're going to California.

544
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:37,995
Are you sure?

545
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,131
I want you to.

546
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,966
Thank you.

547
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:50,641
Dawn, get my things.

548
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,378
You know, you shit
the bed in there.

549
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:57,014
- I don't care.
- Was any of that true?

550
00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:59,516
Yes.
I have to go home.

551
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:02,486
Happy Thanksgiving, sweetheart.

552
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,889
You, too,
Mr. Draper.

553
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:17,287
<i>It occurred during the
Roaring 20s dinner dance,</i>

554
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:18,988
<i>so your mother likely went</i>
<i>missing over the promenade.</i>

555
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:21,424
<i>It's the only way she wouldn't</i>
<i>have hit a deck below.</i>

556
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:23,393
No, where was the boat?

557
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:25,729
<i>Oh, somewhere off</i>
<i>the coast of Martinique.</i>

558
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:27,397
Did they check the beaches?

559
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:29,566
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>there are a lot of sharks.</i>

560
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,434
Dear Lord.

561
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:34,638
<i>As I said, there's no impetus for
either government to investigate</i>

562
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:37,140
<i>and the SS Sunset Princess</i>
<i>in contacting you</i>

563
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:38,408
<i>has fulfilled its obligation.</i>

564
00:35:38,442 --> 00:35:40,710
It's 1968.

565
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:42,412
Surely you're not telling me

566
00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:45,482
there's still some
international oceanic limbo

567
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,016
where murder is smiled upon.

568
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,852
<i>I have a private investigator</i>
<i>prepared to board the ship</i>

569
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:52,455
<i>and locate your mother's</i>
<i>husband-- well, nurse--</i>

570
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,224
<i>Manolo Colón,</i>
<i>alias Marcus Constantine.</i>

571
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:57,527
<i>We also have wheels</i>
<i>we can grease in Panama.</i>

572
00:35:57,561 --> 00:36:00,697
<i>No stone unturned,</i>
<i>no expense spared.</i>

573
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,239
Ahem, let's say we want
the very best of everything.

574
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:12,942
What <i>are</i> the expenses?

575
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:14,511
<i>To bring your mother's</i>
<i>killer to justice?</i>

576
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:17,414
- Ballpark.
- <i>It may take time.</i>

577
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:21,451
<i>Now that Manolo's aware of her limited
financial resources, he may bolt.</i>

578
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:25,422
Alvin, I have another
call coming in.

579
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,557
Can we continue this later?

580
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:38,535
When you think about it,

581
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:40,804
it won't bring her back.

582
00:36:43,374 --> 00:36:46,943
She's in the water

583
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,945
with Father.

584
00:36:52,182 --> 00:36:54,551
She loved the sea.

585
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:04,761
<i>I didn't want to disturb you.</i>

586
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:08,231
What happened?

587
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,900
I don't even know
how to say this.

588
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:13,169
Did you tell Nan?

589
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:15,638
Did you confess?
I told you to wait.

590
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:17,674
No, that's--

591
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,576
I'm going to California.

592
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:24,313
You can stay here
and have your life

593
00:37:24,348 --> 00:37:28,485
and your career
and let this be the past.

594
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,953
I can't believe Don did this.

595
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:34,023
I knew he wasn't going.
He knows it's Siberia.

596
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:35,859
- I can undo this.
- No, Peggy.

597
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:37,994
He gave up his spot for me.

598
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:39,696
Don?

599
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,899
I wanted this so much,
but I have a family.

600
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:44,868
The world out there...

601
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:49,038
I have to hold onto them

602
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:51,107
or I'll get lost in the chaos.

603
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:56,446
Oh.

604
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,515
You have to listen to me.

605
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,385
I love you that deeply.

606
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:05,722
I can't be around you.

607
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:07,590
And I can't ruin
all those lives.

608
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:10,760
Get out.
Just get out.

609
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:19,536
Someday you'll be glad
I made this decision.

610
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,473
Well, aren't you <i>lucky</i>
to have decisions?

611
00:38:45,563 --> 00:38:48,364
Dawn just called. She said
there's a partners' meeting

612
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:50,500
tomorrow about California.

613
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:53,302
Attendance is mandatory.
9:00.

614
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:55,572
You have a meeting
on Thanksgiving.

615
00:38:55,606 --> 00:38:57,540
They must really
want us out of here fast.

616
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:00,142
Honey.

617
00:39:00,177 --> 00:39:02,411
You have to sit down.

618
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:03,880
Why?

619
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:05,882
Because something came up.

620
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,817
And it's not
just Sally, it's--

621
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,519
It's what?

622
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:14,657
I'm sorry, but we can't
go to California right now.

623
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:20,162
No, Don, that's--

624
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:21,798
that's not possible

625
00:39:21,832 --> 00:39:23,800
because I already told Mel

626
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,869
and Jeff Hunter's got me a
bunch of meetings out there

627
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:28,337
- and the train is leaving the station.
- The agency decided that--

628
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:30,907
Fuck the agency.
I quit my job.

629
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:33,142
Megan.

630
00:39:33,176 --> 00:39:34,944
You know what?

631
00:39:34,979 --> 00:39:37,947
I don't even know why we're
fighting for this anymore.

632
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:40,149
I don't know what it is.

633
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:42,318
We don't have any kids.

634
00:39:42,352 --> 00:39:44,888
You <i>want</i> to be alone
with your liquor

635
00:39:44,922 --> 00:39:46,856
and your ex-wife
and your screwed-up kids.

636
00:39:46,891 --> 00:39:49,225
Don't say that.

637
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:53,462
I love them to death.

638
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,100
I used to feel pity for them,

639
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:00,803
but now I realize
we're all in the same boat.

640
00:40:01,872 --> 00:40:04,306
I know you're upset.

641
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:07,577
But I'm gonna be out there
all the time with you.

642
00:40:08,746 --> 00:40:10,013
We'll be bicoastal.

643
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:19,121
Megan, I love you.

644
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:23,026
I can't do this.

645
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,394
I can't be here right now.

646
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:39,408
They'll deliver the lowboy

647
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:41,678
and the china closet
next Friday.

648
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:43,646
I couldn't take any more

649
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:45,347
and I already look like
the Beverly Hillbillies

650
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:46,716
with the chair
tied to the roof.

651
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,885
I don't want your
mother's things, Peter.

652
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:52,789
Well, Bud's not
getting everything.

653
00:40:52,823 --> 00:40:55,024
And I'm not moving everything
to California with me.

654
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:57,159
It's fine.
I'll manage.

655
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:58,928
When are you leaving
for your parents'?

656
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:01,631
When Tammy finishes her nap.

657
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:03,733
When are you leaving
for Los Angeles?

658
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,402
Soon as I can.

659
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:09,038
I'd invite you, but I think it's
best you're alone right now.

660
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:12,408
- Don't be cruel.
- No.

661
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:16,045
It's going to take you a moment
to realize where you are.

662
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,014
You're free.

663
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:21,450
Free of her.
You're free of them.

664
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:23,285
You're free of everything.

665
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:26,388
It's not the way I wanted it.

666
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:28,725
Now you know that.

667
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:35,197
Can I go in and say goodbye?
I won't wake her.

668
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:05,762
I was told 9:00.

669
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:08,430
Right on time.
Impressive.

670
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:10,299
Don, we need to have
a serious conversation.

671
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:11,634
Where would you like to do it?

672
00:42:11,669 --> 00:42:13,502
Is this about the Hershey
meeting yesterday?

673
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:14,637
Because I can explain.

674
00:42:14,672 --> 00:42:16,438
Well, unfortunately,
that meeting

675
00:42:16,473 --> 00:42:20,543
and most of your questionable
behavior is beyond explanation.

676
00:42:24,314 --> 00:42:26,149
Should I sit down?

677
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:28,051
Yes.

678
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,587
I'm not going to defend myself.

679
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,223
I've tolerated plenty
from every one of you.

680
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:35,992
Don, there's no need
for defense.

681
00:42:36,026 --> 00:42:37,694
This isn't a trial.

682
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:39,495
The verdict has been reached.

683
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:41,998
So what time
did this meeting start?

684
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:43,632
We think it's best
for you and the firm

685
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:46,035
if you take some
time off and regroup.

686
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,537
- How much time?
- A few months.

687
00:42:48,572 --> 00:42:52,041
But the holidays are coming.
That'll take up most of it.

688
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:54,010
Did you tell Ted?

689
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:56,145
'Cause he can't go to California if
there's no one here to run New York.

690
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,781
Ted feels confident he can
oversee Peggy from LA.

691
00:42:58,816 --> 00:43:00,883
He knows it's temporary.

692
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:04,687
I want a return date.

693
00:43:04,722 --> 00:43:07,389
We can't give you that.

694
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,326
You all agree with this?

695
00:43:11,561 --> 00:43:14,097
Try and see it from our side.

696
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,694
- Good morning.
- Hello, Don.

697
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:48,131
You're early.

698
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:50,099
Sorry about that, old chum.

699
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:52,701
This is Lou Avery
from Dancer Fitzgerald.

700
00:43:52,736 --> 00:43:54,203
We've met.

701
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:56,605
Going down?

702
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,427
What's that?

703
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:20,396
We couldn't send it back.

704
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:26,368
- Hey.
- What?

705
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:28,570
Happy holidays.

706
00:44:28,605 --> 00:44:30,239
What's he doing here?

707
00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:33,242
I'm inviting you
into Kevin's life,

708
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:34,877
not mine.

709
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:37,046
Okay.

710
00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:40,582
Hi, Bob.

711
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:42,084
Mom, Roger's here.

712
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,886
Gail got her hair done for you.

713
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,691
Hello, little man.

714
00:44:50,327 --> 00:44:52,895
- You ready for some turkey?
- Yes.

715
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:55,898
Here, let me get it for you.

716
00:45:03,907 --> 00:45:05,908
I thought you left.

717
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:08,811
No, I've got too much to do.

718
00:45:08,846 --> 00:45:11,380
And you thought
you'd do it in here?

719
00:45:11,414 --> 00:45:13,682
It's where everything is.

720
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:17,086
See you Monday.

721
00:45:31,835 --> 00:45:34,603
Did they name it "Hershey"
because of the chocolate

722
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:36,505
or is the chocolate
named after the city?

723
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:39,775
There was a man named Hershey.

724
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:43,112
He made enough chocolate
to build a town.

725
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:44,981
Why are we stopping?

726
00:45:45,015 --> 00:45:47,016
This is a bad neighborhood.

727
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,085
Come on.

728
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:07,803
This is where I grew up.
