00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>Don't know how many times</i>

3
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:18,740
<i>I've been crossed off the list
and left for dead.</i>

4
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:23,146
<i>Guess when it first happens
the day you were born...</i>

5
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:25,176
<i>you're gonna lose count.</i>

6
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,081
<i>So this...</i>

7
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:35,456
<i>this ain't nothing new.</i>

8
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,977
<i>There are bad days...</i>

9
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,758
<i>and then there are legendary bad days.</i>

10
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,959
<i>This was shaping up to be one of those.</i>

11
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,827
<i>Whole damn planet wanted a piece of me.</i>

12
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,898
<i>Can't stay in the open.</i>

13
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,340
<i>Can't risk another attack.</i>

14
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,797
<i>It's always the punch you don't see
coming that puts you down.</i>

15
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,035
<i>But why didn't I see it?</i>

16
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,966
<i>Of course they were
gonna try to kill me.</i>

17
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,639
<i>Death is what they do for a living.</i>

18
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:00,146
<i>So the question ain't
"What happened?"</i>

19
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,414
<i>The question is...</i>

20
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,283
<i>"What happened to me?"</i>

21
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,206
<i>You are the Lord Marshal now.</i>

22
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,280
<i>How did they get so close?</i>

23
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:42,451
<i>How did I let them
blindside me like that?</i>

24
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,123
<i>Threshold!
Take us to the threshold!</i>

25
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,598
<i>Necromongers.</i>

26
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,299
<i>Some wanted to put a crown on my head.</i>

27
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:57,100
<i>Some wanted to put a noose
around my neck.</i>

28
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,604
<i>Please...</i>

29
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,741
<i>come back to bed.</i>

30
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,617
<i>Every Lord Marshal was supposed
to take some big oath...</i>

31
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,520
<i>one that I never really got around to.</i>

32
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,518
<i>You could say it created
a little friction...</i>

33
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:22,054
<i>and more than a few assassins.</i>

34
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:26,467
<i>I needed a way out.</i>

35
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,604
<i>Some new place.</i>

36
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,009
<i>Or maybe just...</i>

37
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,776
<i>an old one.</i>

38
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,140
Furya.

39
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:44,048
I know what it's called.

40
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,953
You just don't know where it is.

41
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,623
- I need charts. I need maps.
- Impossible.

42
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:51,626
I need a direction.

43
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:53,822
Purged from all records,
as you well know.

44
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:57,630
But you remember where,
Commander Vaako.

45
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,667
So many worlds...

46
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,336
The only map left in existence...

47
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:07,976
is the one that's in my head...

48
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:09,944
Riddick.

49
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:17,318
So what do you want?

50
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,717
The crown?

51
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,726
Transcendence.

52
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:35,194
Krone.

53
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,238
Break off a ship.

54
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:40,771
Riddick's going home.

55
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,168
Vaako.

56
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:49,252
You can't blame him
for dangling Furya.

57
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,717
Home has a certain equity.

58
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,822
But I do blame him for what came next.

59
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,569
It's a long way to come.

60
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:18,773
For this.

61
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:23,752
This guy with
the fucked-up face, Krone...

62
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,653
he was supposed to be our ride home.

63
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:35,054
But instead of Furya,
we wind up someplace called...

64
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,258
Not Furya.

65
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:49,569
Yet again,
someone was trying to play me.

66
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:53,548
So yet again...

67
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,780
we play for blood.

68
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,447
You keep what you kill, Riddick!!

69
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,144
You keep what you kill!

70
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,256
Somewhere along the way,
I lost a step.

71
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:46,962
I got sloppy.

72
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:49,227
Dulled my own edge.

73
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,793
Maybe I went and
did the worst crime of all...

74
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,871
I got civilized.

75
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,949
So now we zero the clock.

76
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,021
Just me and this no-name world.

77
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,350
Gotta find that animal side again.

78
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:28,386
Before long...

79
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,664
I realized there was
a whole other world over there...

80
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,571
of water, grass and life.

81
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:41,505
Just had one thing in my way.

82
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:27,166
Come on, show me some teeth.

83
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:42,669
Escape artist, huh?

84
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:27,169
What have you got over there?

85
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,390
Thought we shared everything.

86
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,013
Drop it.

87
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:06,999
Stay.

88
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:44,412
Bounty hunters...

89
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:00,424
Wait.

90
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:04,193
Wait...

91
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,732
Steady...

92
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:08,065
Okay, now.

93
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:15,610
Sounds good.

94
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:29,322
All yours.

95
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,589
It says "dog food" on it.

96
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,700
If you could read.

97
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:47,474
Come on...

98
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,377
Alright. Bring me my reserve.

99
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:11,021
Where's yours?

100
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:41,654
Rain.

101
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:44,154
It's a good thing.

102
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:48,828
Just because you've never seen it
before doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

103
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:52,139
Hey... easy...

104
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,882
Looks like our time is up here.

105
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:08,634
Nothing.

106
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:12,736
Look again, Diaz.

107
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,420
Somebody should teach
this Riddick asshole how to count.

108
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:21,649
"Leave one ship"?

109
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,489
Like we've got a fucking spare
laying around.

110
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:26,825
Let's crank it up.

111
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,737
Morning, Cyclops.

112
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:04,626
Hey, Luna.

113
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:08,494
Yeah.

114
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:11,263
Wake her up, kick her outta bed.

115
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:12,771
What do you mean?

116
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:14,674
We're running heavy.

117
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:16,077
She's a prisoner.

118
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:18,698
- Wasn't she gonna pay our way back?
- We're going big now.

119
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:22,706
Okay? Cut that 60 kilos loose.

120
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:42,170
- Get away! Get away from me!
- Stop, just stop!

121
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:43,563
What do you want now?

122
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:46,533
I'm gonna take off the restraints.
Okay?

123
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:51,034
- I don't want them off.
- No, it's not like that.

124
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,478
Nobody's gonna touch you now.

125
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:55,846
Santana's head is into other stuff now.

126
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:58,314
Your lucky day.

127
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,147
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Alright.

128
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,632
What planet is this?
Where are we?

129
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,893
It's got air and water.
That's all you gotta know.

130
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,173
- But how am I supposed to survive?
- Just go.

131
00:36:21,343 --> 00:36:23,270
Before he changes his mind.

132
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:50,901
I was getting attached to her.

133
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:56,009
Now where is my box at?

134
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:19,763
The name...

135
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,102
is Santana!

136
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:26,001
Shot-caller for this crew right here!

137
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:33,009
I am the guy who knows all,
sees all, beats all!

138
00:37:33,882 --> 00:37:35,945
Spitting it kinda strong, ain't he?

139
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:39,050
Gotta bait the trap.

140
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:44,025
I've come all this way
to collect your head in a box!

141
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:45,554
Right here!

142
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:49,459
So have yourself a fine day now...

143
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,824
Mr. Richard B. Riddick!

144
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,191
I suspect...

145
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:59,206
it will be one...
of your very last!

146
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:04,068
Well, you don't need to agitate Riddick
any more than... you know.

147
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:07,844
Any more than bringing his head
back in a box would?

148
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,302
Shit.

149
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:37,905
Here comes the neighborhood.

150
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:44,182
Small world.

151
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:56,998
Unidentified vessel,
this is Clan Vagos out of Ursa Five.

152
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,100
Be advised that
we are on the ground now

153
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:01,602
and have responded
to emergency signal.

154
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:05,430
No distress found, no need to land.

155
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:10,568
I repeat, there is no reason for you
to land at this location at this time.

156
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:12,213
Is that clear?

157
00:39:12,214 --> 00:39:16,541
No reason for you to land
at this location at this time.

158
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:20,749
What the fuck did I just say?!

159
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:41,239
It was a long haul.
We could take on some water.

160
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:44,324
Wouldn't mind a little
true-gravity time either.

161
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,281
Like I was saying, I've got this.

162
00:39:54,856 --> 00:39:58,216
You know who that was, right?
On the emergency beacon?

163
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:02,894
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.

164
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:06,757
The concept of back-up still
has no appeal to you?

165
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:10,232
My besties here can ball with anyone.

166
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:13,073
No disrespect for your crew,
of course,

167
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:17,245
who look strong, too,
in those matchy-matchy outfits.

168
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:20,071
Shit. Didn't know
there was a dress code.

169
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:21,472
Yeah, right?

170
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,216
Well, it's not my intention
to jump another man's claim.

171
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:28,594
If you don't mind, maybe we'll just pull
up a chair and spectate for a while.

172
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:31,481
What if I do?

173
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:35,257
This is a Co-op station, pal.
It's open to all mercs.

174
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:39,631
- By the way, my name is...
- "Too late".

175
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:43,095
That's your name.
Too Late.

176
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:46,635
And I don't need you stepping
all over my dick here, my friend.

177
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:48,631
Well, I tell you what.

178
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:53,372
I won't lift a finger to help you until
you come ask me for it. How's that?

179
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:14,831
I was scoping this out earlier.
It's a cave system. Five clicks south.

180
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,238
Might be worth a look.

181
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:19,999
Hey, Too Late.

182
00:41:20,676 --> 00:41:24,343
Need to pull a node from your ship and
store it right here next to mine. Okay?

183
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:25,667
Oh, really? Why's that?

184
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:28,739
Riddick triggered the beacon
to get off-world, right?

185
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:34,145
Basically, he was calling a taxi.

186
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:36,714
And...?

187
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:39,987
And a ship would make
a sweet trap, right?

188
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:44,656
Confined space, metal walls...
jail cell.

189
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:47,058
Ace cool, huh?

190
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:50,604
Is it true half the people you meet
are below average intelligence?

191
00:41:50,605 --> 00:41:53,772
Got to make sure the ship stays grounded
when he comes for them, okay?

192
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:55,143
Come on.

193
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:58,710
Dahl... pull a node from the ship.

194
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:24,539
I'll do it!

195
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:47,719
Any time now, Riddick.

196
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:16,014
I'm telling you, this is total overkill.
Eleven of us out here now?

197
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:18,858
Should have been a four-man op, tops.

198
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,862
You are jinxing our janx, man.
And that ain't cool.

199
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:25,326
Hey, I don't give a shit what they say.
He's one guy.

200
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:29,167
Whatever you say.

201
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,564
He's one guy.

202
00:43:47,022 --> 00:43:50,257
So I guess that's what passes for
a fucking moon on this planet.

203
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:53,059
It's gonna be a dark night.

204
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,457
Advantage, him.

205
00:43:56,865 --> 00:44:00,760
Maybe he's gonna wear you down first.
Force you to go without sleep.

206
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:02,863
Can't you see I'm busy?

207
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:05,733
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

208
00:44:05,974 --> 00:44:09,038
Well, now that you have...

209
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:15,580
can I politely invite you to
step off my fucking porch?!

210
00:44:17,886 --> 00:44:19,380
I'll start rotating down.

211
00:44:19,788 --> 00:44:20,952
You let me know, huh?

212
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:24,286
As soon as I have his head in a box,
I will let you know.

213
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:51,675
Grid 29D.
Stand by, stand by.

214
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:57,989
What you got, cuz?

215
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:03,057
Some dingo-dongo thing.

216
00:45:07,435 --> 00:45:09,965
Yeah. I see it now.

217
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:11,572
You want me to pop it?

218
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:14,068
Knock it down.
One shot suppressed.

219
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,914
Nice work, Diaz.
Encouraging.

220
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:24,043
Had something in my eye.

221
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:25,780
It's called a scope.

222
00:45:26,388 --> 00:45:27,746
Try next time.

223
00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:29,512
You got this, right?

224
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:33,484
Will you get off my freaking frequency!

225
00:45:57,852 --> 00:45:59,392
What the fuck is going on here?

226
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:23,201
Thank fucking God!

227
00:46:23,945 --> 00:46:25,337
Fuck off!

228
00:46:28,049 --> 00:46:32,308
Rubio, coming your way now.
Gotta swap out a bad sensor.

229
00:46:36,024 --> 00:46:37,882
What was here versus what was found.

230
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,252
How does it square?

231
00:46:40,595 --> 00:46:44,228
Pretty good. The morphine's gone,
but that's always the first thing to go.

232
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:47,701
That was a bit weird, though.

233
00:46:48,903 --> 00:46:52,195
"A predator restraint
with 4 2-inch offset jaws."

234
00:46:52,507 --> 00:46:54,866
Six listed, zero found.

235
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:57,770
Well, it is an odd thing
to go for a walk.

236
00:46:58,046 --> 00:47:01,015
Yeah, but Boss, you know how
shit goes missing from these stations.

237
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:03,682
One bad year and guys
are ripping shit off for salvage.

238
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:13,816
Hey, Santana?

239
00:47:14,763 --> 00:47:17,429
You did sweep the area
before I got here, right?

240
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:18,992
Sweep for what?

241
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:22,069
Well, I just want to make sure
no one has set any traps for us.

242
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,359
5Q.

243
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:28,970
- Understand what I'm saying?
- Traps?

244
00:47:29,044 --> 00:47:30,402
What kind of traps?

245
00:47:30,545 --> 00:47:32,278
The kind with jaws.

246
00:47:39,254 --> 00:47:41,112
Don't touch that fucking thing!

247
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:48,526
What?

248
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:53,929
Up-armor.

249
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:05,170
Shit!

250
00:48:05,914 --> 00:48:06,942
Ready, ready.

251
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:13,378
Stay put, stay put!
Stay put, stay put!

252
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:25,161
Who the hell was
that screaming and why?

253
00:48:27,268 --> 00:48:28,296
Nunez...

254
00:48:29,237 --> 00:48:30,902
break out the sweep gear.

255
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:35,109
And figure out how many
of these big-ass traps...

256
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,037
we got out here, okay?

257
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:43,240
I'm thinking maybe the whole upper left
quad is some kind of fucking mine field.

258
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:45,744
You do that now, okay, Nunez?

259
00:48:47,922 --> 00:48:49,655
Copy that, Nunez?

260
00:48:54,195 --> 00:48:55,655
Nunez?

261
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:00,667
This is bad.
This is very bad.

262
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:05,500
- Nunez? Nunez?
- Shut the fuck up, puto!

263
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:08,275
His radio just crapped out.
Someone get eyes on him.

264
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,470
And show him right where
he should be - 13H. Go, go, go!

265
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,814
Right here.

266
00:49:19,954 --> 00:49:22,154
13-H. He's supposed to be
right fucking...

267
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:32,199
So this was overkill, huh?
Eleven of us, too many, yeah.

268
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,195
You know all about Riddick, right?

269
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:36,899
Well, maybe you need
to take that shit back!

270
00:49:37,338 --> 00:49:40,038
Take the jinx off our janx.
You understand me?

271
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:45,403
That's what you need to do, Falco.
You need to unjinxelate our fucking janx!

272
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:54,253
Don't mess with me now.

273
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:58,325
Hey, what is it?

274
00:49:58,326 --> 00:49:59,259
- Get back!
- It's me, it's me.

275
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,549
He's got Falco!

276
00:50:09,404 --> 00:50:11,433
Jock up, but you're staying home.

277
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:14,569
No one's going out there
until I say so.

278
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:18,245
- Man down, he got Falco.
- Compromise, compromise.

279
00:50:18,246 --> 00:50:21,148
- How the fuck did he do that?
- Never even saw him. He was right here...

280
00:50:21,149 --> 00:50:22,182
What about the ship?
Is he on it?

281
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:26,146
He's not coming for the ships,
he's coming for us! Just fucking shoot!

282
00:50:34,562 --> 00:50:36,454
One night, three dead.

283
00:50:36,931 --> 00:50:38,721
Not sure I'm loving this trend.

284
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:40,601
Two dead, one missing.

285
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:42,269
Exactly. Three dead.

286
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,936
Well, look at it this way, boys.

287
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:48,999
We might all fit on one ship now.

288
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,306
Diaz!

289
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:56,807
Get those other traps back there.

290
00:50:57,385 --> 00:51:01,587
Luna, say something Bible-like
over these bodies.

291
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:13,761
Okay, maybe...

292
00:51:15,236 --> 00:51:16,867
we zero this out.

293
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,634
What is your tag anyway?

294
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,100
So now you wanna know my name.

295
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,645
Well, I'm not sure I'm gonna say.

296
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:30,742
Because everyone you know by name,
Santana, winds up dead.

297
00:51:34,122 --> 00:51:35,719
You gonna clean this shit up?

298
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,055
Shut up, fucking bitch!

299
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:46,161
Excuse me.

300
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:49,102
Watch out for surprise attacks.

301
00:51:50,204 --> 00:51:51,436
Maybe...

302
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:56,170
Maybe it's time to start
merging assets, right?

303
00:51:58,646 --> 00:52:00,538
So this is you asking for my help?

304
00:52:00,915 --> 00:52:04,275
This is me saying that
I may need some of your gear.

305
00:52:06,154 --> 00:52:09,890
If some of your guys happen
to come attached to that gear...

306
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:14,884
I will understand
that's the way it's gotta be.

307
00:52:16,064 --> 00:52:17,956
So you're asking for my gear's help?

308
00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:20,260
More like that.

309
00:52:21,235 --> 00:52:22,524
Moss...?

310
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:32,310
The gear says "nah". Bitch.

311
00:52:32,947 --> 00:52:34,145
There's your answer.

312
00:52:34,482 --> 00:52:36,511
What the fuck do you want, man?

313
00:52:36,684 --> 00:52:40,385
You know what?
I'm gonna fold you in, Santana.

314
00:52:40,455 --> 00:52:44,521
But I give orders to Dahl.
And Dahl's gonna give orders to you.

315
00:52:44,692 --> 00:52:47,358
And that's the chain of command
from this point forward.

316
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:50,987
Why am I not loving this plan so far?

317
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,801
Oh, I know.
You know why?

318
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:57,904
Because it sucks ass and swallows!

319
00:52:57,905 --> 00:53:02,073
I'm not taking orders from your pet whore
who thinks I won't smack her right back...

320
00:53:04,712 --> 00:53:06,104
I don't fuck guys.

321
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:09,295
Occasionally I fuck 'em up
if they need it.

322
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:15,349
Here's what's gonna happen, Santana.
You're gonna take a back seat.

323
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:18,052
We'll track Riddick down, I promise.

324
00:53:18,326 --> 00:53:20,093
But I want him alive.

325
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:24,258
You give me a day
and after that he's yours to kill.

326
00:53:24,732 --> 00:53:26,466
You're giving me the bounty?

327
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:31,033
You pay my crew, fuel costs,
the rest is yours. That's the deal.

328
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:36,843
What is Riddick for you?
Not just some convict.

329
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:39,704
What do you want?
Why are you here?

330
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:41,306
Who are you?

331
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:43,911
My name is Johns.

332
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:46,353
Lock down those ships,
get those hogs on deck.

333
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:48,455
I will ride with Moss and Lockspur.

334
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:52,715
I want a non-lethal load-out.
L.O.D.'s and phosphor frags to start with.

335
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,019
This is a man that hunts by night.
We'll take it to him by day.

336
00:53:57,698 --> 00:54:01,229
Diaz! Vargas!
Show me the spot of the last kill.

337
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,237
Some kind of canine.

338
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:21,384
Hey, Diaz, I've got a dog here.

339
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:24,653
Is it the same dingo-dongo thing
from last night?

340
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,461
Nah, I'm pretty sure we killed that one.

341
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:35,934
Could be the same one.

342
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:37,804
The same.

343
00:54:37,805 --> 00:54:40,699
Dahl, get your sniper rifle
and barium rounds now.

344
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:53,742
1500 meters.

345
00:56:06,694 --> 00:56:08,825
Could be just the first hole it found.

346
00:56:09,263 --> 00:56:12,464
A stressed animal is gonna run
to ground it knows.

347
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:16,859
Besides...
I'm getting human pheromones.

348
00:57:40,288 --> 00:57:41,145
Riddick!

349
00:57:48,796 --> 00:57:50,723
Dial down, dial down, dial down!

350
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:01,207
- Santana's guy.
- Falco.

351
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:03,476
Shit. Did we just kill a hostage?

352
00:58:03,477 --> 00:58:05,404
I've been hunting Riddick for ten years.

353
00:58:05,513 --> 00:58:07,974
The concept of a hostage
has no appeal to him.

354
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:10,376
Falco was already dead.

355
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:13,987
This is just some fucking side-show
to buy more time.

356
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:18,356
Fuck!

357
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:20,355
Shit...

358
00:58:24,265 --> 00:58:26,260
Just dropped some mud right there.

359
00:58:27,268 --> 00:58:28,967
So if Riddick isn't here...

360
00:59:09,744 --> 00:59:13,775
Dahl, do you copy?
Does anyone copy?

361
00:59:14,448 --> 00:59:15,806
Dahl, you there?

362
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:13,164
Boom.

363
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:19,771
Were you just perving out
on me somehow?

364
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,178
May all your dreams come true, baby.

365
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:27,878
You've got two minutes.
I want you out on fucking watch.

366
01:00:33,894 --> 01:00:35,126
Luna!

367
01:00:40,067 --> 01:00:44,201
Don't watch me. Watch my back.
That's what you're here for.

368
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:47,404
Take two steps forward. Two.

369
01:00:57,751 --> 01:00:59,643
Remember, he could be anywhere.

370
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:53,365
This is Johns to any-goddamn-body
at the station.

371
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:58,171
I want you to keep an eye on that locker.
Keep an eye on the node.

372
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:00,774
Riddick may have made an end run.

373
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:05,408
My ETA is seven minutes.
But watch your back.

374
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:15,919
Where did you go, bitch?

375
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,761
Your two minutes are up.
You gonna do what I tell you to do?

376
01:02:22,603 --> 01:02:25,497
Rumor is Riddick might be
in the vicinity.

377
01:02:25,506 --> 01:02:28,070
Thought I should just
check on the locker.

378
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:34,537
Get outside, get on your optics,
and get after this fucker!

379
01:02:34,782 --> 01:02:36,947
You're not gonna find him here.

380
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:54,331
Actually, Dahl, I think
we have something in common.

381
01:02:55,002 --> 01:02:58,465
I don't fuck guys either.

382
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:44,341
You need to see this.

383
01:03:53,694 --> 01:03:55,120
He wrote that?

384
01:03:55,996 --> 01:03:59,356
He took out our deep
space communications. All of it.

385
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,995
And whose blood is that?
There...? Here...?

386
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:05,495
Over there...?

387
01:04:11,078 --> 01:04:14,006
I had to kick his ass again.
Sorry.

388
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:16,404
Not really.

389
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:25,050
Fuck it.

390
01:04:26,894 --> 01:04:28,525
Let's take a look at this.

391
01:04:40,374 --> 01:04:41,368
Stop.

392
01:04:44,411 --> 01:04:45,939
That key leave your neck?

393
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:48,943
Never.

394
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:51,913
Well, the only reason to write
"fair trade"...

395
01:04:51,919 --> 01:04:54,619
is if he got into that locker
and he took something out.

396
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:58,591
Something that we need,
like a power node...

397
01:04:58,592 --> 01:05:01,861
which he could then
swap for something he needs.

398
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,157
All that? Wow.

399
01:05:05,532 --> 01:05:07,823
Highly unlikely.

400
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,270
Let me connect
the fucking dots, Santana.

401
01:05:11,271 --> 01:05:13,339
Here's what I'm saying.
If he did get in there somehow,

402
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:17,599
he was in a position to relock it
and change the code.

403
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:20,804
Could be entering
the wrong shit, Santana.

404
01:05:22,816 --> 01:05:24,140
So...

405
01:05:25,652 --> 01:05:30,286
do you think sometime
during the last few hours...

406
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:34,293
he got this off my neck
without me noticing...

407
01:05:34,294 --> 01:05:37,263
did whatever he did,
put the fucking key back

408
01:05:37,264 --> 01:05:40,294
on my fucking neck
without me fucking noticing?

409
01:05:40,834 --> 01:05:42,362
Is that what you're saying?

410
01:05:42,436 --> 01:05:46,439
Where did you get that theory from?
A unicorn's ass?

411
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,508
There's a reason he is who he is.

412
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:52,643
He's a convict.
Not some Zulu warlock.

413
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,840
You know what you know.

414
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:11,628
This is crazy.

415
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:15,734
This is fucking crazy.
The first three clicks were good.

416
01:06:16,336 --> 01:06:17,870
It did not go off.

417
01:06:17,871 --> 01:06:19,934
You can get three clicks
in Russian Roulette.

418
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:22,436
Don't mean you get four, motherfucker.

419
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:26,870
You know what, Santana?
For once I actually agree with you.

420
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:28,203
Shut up.

421
01:06:30,984 --> 01:06:33,479
You... Do you think we're good?

422
01:06:34,321 --> 01:06:35,417
Yeah.

423
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:37,621
I think you're good, cuz.

424
01:06:37,825 --> 01:06:40,184
You're fucking good.
Just butch up.

425
01:06:41,161 --> 01:06:44,624
Sounds like your department, lesbo.

426
01:06:44,765 --> 01:06:45,998
I'm not opening that thing.

427
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:48,893
- Oh yes, you fucking are!
- I'm so fucking not!

428
01:06:49,903 --> 01:06:53,366
Hey, hey!
Use your fucking brains!

429
01:06:53,473 --> 01:06:56,139
We are not gonna do
Riddick's work for him!

430
01:06:56,877 --> 01:06:58,508
Put your weapons down.

431
01:06:59,346 --> 01:07:00,772
And have a look at that.

432
01:07:01,715 --> 01:07:02,845
He was here.

433
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:04,917
Right fucking there.

434
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:07,816
Santana, put your fucking sword away.

435
01:07:11,558 --> 01:07:13,485
Don't fucking open it, then.

436
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:16,957
Well, the problem with that, Santana,
we never open that locker...

437
01:07:16,997 --> 01:07:18,662
and we never leave.

438
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:39,777
...of my life and my salvation
Whom shall I fear.

439
01:07:40,053 --> 01:07:42,378
The strength of my life
of Whom shall I be afraid.

440
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,156
Four.

441
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:50,091
Try five.

442
01:07:56,436 --> 01:07:57,498
Five.

443
01:08:04,011 --> 01:08:05,005
And...

444
01:08:11,585 --> 01:08:12,579
Oops.

445
01:08:14,054 --> 01:08:15,582
Wish I'd have thought of that.

446
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:26,927
Six!

447
01:08:30,637 --> 01:08:31,801
Six.

448
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,472
Six.

449
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:43,239
You are a shit storm trooper, Santana.
I'll give you that.

450
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,145
You beat the devil this time.

451
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:47,620
Didn't actually think
he was gonna do it.

452
01:08:48,855 --> 01:08:50,122
This is a sign.

453
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:54,255
Sweet.

454
01:08:55,762 --> 01:08:57,427
I believe this is a sign.

455
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,396
It may be the good Lord
wants us to take these nodes...

456
01:09:03,437 --> 01:09:05,864
and flee this planet
just as soon as we can.

457
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:13,246
That's my good luck charm.

458
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:18,250
Wrong business, kid.

459
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:21,699
You know, I was kind of hoping
the bomb would go off.

460
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:36,298
So we sealed up his cave with some
phosphor frags here, so he can't go back.

461
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:39,338
And just like an animal,
he's gonna head to known ground.

462
01:09:39,573 --> 01:09:42,341
But we're gonna find he's got
three or four layers out there.

463
01:09:42,642 --> 01:09:45,376
So we'll radius out
from this point... here.

464
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:49,771
That radio counts. I saw three
repeaters listed in inventory.

465
01:09:49,883 --> 01:09:52,674
Find them.
Set them up at regular intervals.

466
01:09:53,353 --> 01:09:55,854
I never want to be out of
communication like that again.

467
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:32,315
Are you scared of me?

468
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:35,722
Yeah.

469
01:10:40,133 --> 01:10:41,627
Are they scared of me?

470
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:45,561
Yes, they're scared of you.

471
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:54,410
Maybe you're all scared
of the wrong thing.

472
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:57,516
Lockspur, I want you to lock
down those hogs, alright?

473
01:10:57,517 --> 01:11:00,251
I don't want this guy any
more mobile than he already is.

474
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:03,522
Dahl, I spotted a nice
little nest for you.

475
01:11:03,523 --> 01:11:05,586
Right here and in these low hills.

476
01:11:12,165 --> 01:11:13,261
Moss?

477
01:11:16,603 --> 01:11:17,927
I just saw him.

478
01:11:19,806 --> 01:11:20,800
Say it again?

479
01:11:22,209 --> 01:11:23,737
I just saw him.

480
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:36,222
Dahl, I want you to sit on this ship!

481
01:11:36,223 --> 01:11:38,624
Diaz, make sure your ship
is locked down!

482
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:42,928
The rest of you get on the fucking perimeter
and keep your eyes on each other!

483
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:46,392
Santana!
He got the fucking nodes!

484
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,008
I know.
It's coming.

485
01:12:39,953 --> 01:12:41,654
So then we just combine nodes.

486
01:12:41,655 --> 01:12:43,689
Pull one from that ship,
put it in this ship, you know?

487
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:44,791
Amps is amps, right?

488
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,826
It's not about amps. It's about
what each ship is rated to handle.

489
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:50,396
You miss by even a few milli-joules,
you fry every chip you've got.

490
01:12:50,397 --> 01:12:52,995
Okay, so figure out the difference,
and just do it.

491
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:54,733
Jailbreak the fucking thing.

492
01:12:54,734 --> 01:12:56,468
I could give you a crash course

493
01:12:56,469 --> 01:12:59,805
on thermodynamic equilibrium
and energy exchange right now...

494
01:12:59,806 --> 01:13:02,508
or maybe you just want to take
my goddamn word for it.

495
01:13:02,509 --> 01:13:03,242
I get it, I get it.

496
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:06,345
The ships are incompatible. We're not
gonna fly without the nodes back.

497
01:13:06,346 --> 01:13:08,547
Why do I feel like we just
cut off our own nuts here?

498
01:13:08,548 --> 01:13:10,179
Probably because we did.

499
01:13:10,283 --> 01:13:12,918
How about I take one of those jet hogs,
two days worth of food...

500
01:13:12,919 --> 01:13:14,587
and go out and hunt
this fucker down myself.

501
01:13:14,588 --> 01:13:17,186
Bad idea, Diaz.
One-on-one with Riddick?

502
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:19,771
I might be able to get
the emergency beacon working again.

503
01:13:19,893 --> 01:13:22,461
That's like an ambulance
calling for an ambulance, isn't it?

504
01:13:22,462 --> 01:13:24,830
It's back-up for the fucking back-up.
We can't.

505
01:13:24,831 --> 01:13:26,565
I thought he was the one stranded here.

506
01:13:26,566 --> 01:13:28,434
Yeah, well, looks like
you thought wrong.

507
01:13:28,435 --> 01:13:30,726
Long wait for back-up.

508
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:36,800
In case you were thinking about fixing
the beacon and calling for help.

509
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:38,471
Falco's radio.

510
01:13:38,678 --> 01:13:41,947
Riddick, I don't give a fuck
about the back-up.

511
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:46,314
Because I've still got all kinds of gear
that can ruin your day in a hurry.

512
01:13:48,188 --> 01:13:50,683
So you go find another fucking cave.

513
01:13:51,324 --> 01:13:53,558
You keep running, you keep hiding.

514
01:13:54,427 --> 01:13:56,092
Doesn't matter to me.

515
01:13:57,264 --> 01:13:59,725
Because in the end, I will find you!!

516
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:03,733
Look south.

517
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:27,085
I don't believe it.

518
01:14:27,927 --> 01:14:30,195
The balls on this fucking guy.

519
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:34,357
Dahl, keep an eye on things here.

520
01:14:37,304 --> 01:14:39,367
- What should I do?
- Stay low.

521
01:14:42,142 --> 01:14:43,704
Come on. Come on.

522
01:15:05,665 --> 01:15:06,761
Both of you drop.

523
01:15:30,256 --> 01:15:31,955
So what's the bounty at?

524
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:35,190
I don't know. I don't care.
It's not why I'm here.

525
01:15:35,428 --> 01:15:37,696
I bet the big jamoke knows.

526
01:15:37,897 --> 01:15:40,791
Yeah. I know exactly what it is.

527
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:44,699
What I do know is that it's double
if you're brought back dead.

528
01:15:45,472 --> 01:15:46,932
That's new.

529
01:15:48,508 --> 01:15:50,901
Will it be enough to pay
for your funerals?

530
01:15:52,946 --> 01:15:54,440
What I'm interested in...

531
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:59,781
is a little backwater place
with a system code M-344-G.

532
01:16:00,387 --> 01:16:03,019
I want to know what happened
there ten years ago.

533
01:16:06,393 --> 01:16:07,660
The father.

534
01:16:11,798 --> 01:16:14,293
- Big Daddy Johns.
- Yeah, that's right.

535
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:18,932
And you traveled all this way
just to see me.

536
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:22,174
I'm flattered.

537
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:26,042
Well, it's kind of strange not knowing
what to put down in the family Bible.

538
01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:29,014
It's kinda strange three guys
have to die just to you can hear...

539
01:16:29,015 --> 01:16:31,647
No, no, no.
You don't get to put that shit on me.

540
01:16:32,552 --> 01:16:34,319
Those kills are on you.

541
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,854
I have a feeling that's not
the only thing on me right now.

542
01:16:38,425 --> 01:16:41,460
Okay, got barium shells,
stab-shock, explosive tip...

543
01:16:41,461 --> 01:16:43,558
What do you want, barium or stab-shock?

544
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:45,360
Horse tranq.

545
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:55,874
I hate to interrupt this discussion
about ancient history,

546
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:59,474
but maybe I should step in right here
and introduce myself.

547
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,879
- My name is...
- Box Boy.

548
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,509
Say what?

549
01:17:05,185 --> 01:17:09,945
You are the guy who said that he was
gonna put my head in a box. Right?

550
01:17:10,757 --> 01:17:14,720
Well, that was me...
spitting noise.

551
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:18,096
But you do have a box.

552
01:17:18,298 --> 01:17:20,299
Do I have a box?

553
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,033
Thought I saw one.

554
01:17:23,503 --> 01:17:26,670
I mean, of course I've got a box.
Everyone's got a box, man.

555
01:17:27,106 --> 01:17:29,874
Even Diaz has a fucking huge box.

556
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:31,909
Good.

557
01:17:33,046 --> 01:17:34,745
We're gonna use it.

558
01:17:38,518 --> 01:17:41,116
Three down, eight left.

559
01:17:41,588 --> 01:17:43,685
Now, normally I'd just keep going.

560
01:17:44,023 --> 01:17:47,850
Six down... nine down...

561
01:17:48,595 --> 01:17:50,863
You get where I'm going with this.

562
01:17:51,998 --> 01:17:53,663
But things are changing here...

563
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,595
and nobody wants to be
on this planet 24 hours from now.

564
01:17:58,404 --> 01:18:00,569
So I suggest we make it work.

565
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:03,027
What do you want,
a "gentleman’s agreement"?

566
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:06,901
I'll leave one node out in the open.
You take it.

567
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,511
The other node
and the other ship are mine.

568
01:18:10,517 --> 01:18:11,617
Hey, wait, wait.

569
01:18:11,618 --> 01:18:15,979
What are we playing here,
Retard Bingo? What?

570
01:18:16,489 --> 01:18:19,724
- That was on the table from the start...
- Forget the start.

571
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:24,754
It's the end you want
to think about now.

572
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:29,056
See that?

573
01:18:33,206 --> 01:18:36,532
I'll give you till that rain
hits that station.

574
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:40,039
That's your clock.

575
01:18:47,887 --> 01:18:49,119
"Box Boy".

576
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:06,563
Dahl! Do it now! Now!

577
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:24,282
Again!

578
01:19:30,063 --> 01:19:31,455
He's not going down.

579
01:19:35,468 --> 01:19:36,735
Do it again, Dahl!

580
01:19:42,175 --> 01:19:43,874
Just go down.

581
01:20:36,696 --> 01:20:38,054
I got this, Dahl.

582
01:21:12,365 --> 01:21:13,359
Riddick.

583
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:14,927
Riddick?

584
01:21:24,644 --> 01:21:25,808
Johns?

585
01:21:29,015 --> 01:21:31,078
You beating men in chains now?

586
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:42,056
Okay, from the beginning.
For the historical record...

587
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:43,361
The Hunter Gratzner.

588
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:46,598
That's the commercial vessel my son uses
to transport you back to the slammer.

589
01:21:46,599 --> 01:21:51,393
But that ship sends a distress call
somewhere near M-344/G.

590
01:21:51,637 --> 01:21:55,373
It's a backwater system, two suns,
one habitable planet.

591
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,137
Does he survive the crash?

592
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:02,543
Big drama the next few hours.

593
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:08,651
But whatever happens,
no matter what they tell you...

594
01:22:09,689 --> 01:22:12,048
don't let 'em take these chains off me.

595
01:22:13,493 --> 01:22:17,160
"Them?" Who's "them?" Who're you talking...
Do you know who you're talking to here?

596
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:22,825
That was for me?

597
01:22:25,071 --> 01:22:26,538
When the chains come off...

598
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:29,137
- Jesus Christ!
- Box Boy...

599
01:22:29,776 --> 01:22:33,136
you go in the first five seconds.

600
01:22:34,213 --> 01:22:35,411
Really?

601
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:38,807
And you plan on killing me with what,
your mouth?

602
01:22:40,153 --> 01:22:41,784
That shiny blade.

603
01:22:42,755 --> 01:22:44,488
I'd love to see you try.

604
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:50,094
For the historical record...

605
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:53,089
he made it.

606
01:22:59,272 --> 01:23:00,732
So it's just you and him?

607
01:23:02,008 --> 01:23:03,468
Was, uh...

608
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:07,438
about the same number
you see here in this room.

609
01:23:08,948 --> 01:23:10,772
So now many made it off?

610
01:23:11,584 --> 01:23:13,044
Three.

611
01:23:14,487 --> 01:23:15,947
But not him?

612
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:19,048
No.

613
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:23,088
So between the time of the crash
and the time you leave that planet...

614
01:23:23,963 --> 01:23:25,525
my son dies.

615
01:23:25,865 --> 01:23:30,625
And I can safely assume
it's at your hands. Is that right?

616
01:23:33,539 --> 01:23:35,568
I'm wasting my fucking time here!

617
01:23:38,444 --> 01:23:40,575
You grant any last wishes?

618
01:23:46,219 --> 01:23:48,111
I was referring to you.

619
01:23:49,088 --> 01:23:53,722
Not that the chains aren't
a hot look, but no.

620
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:57,495
I'm not gonna straddle you
in front of all these guys.

621
01:23:57,496 --> 01:23:59,730
What if I killed all of 'em first?

622
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:03,164
Easy, boy.

623
01:24:03,703 --> 01:24:06,267
There's a lot more tranq
where that came from.

624
01:24:08,474 --> 01:24:11,402
Tell me what you see outside
that window, Dahl.

625
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:25,156
Cyclops unit, two ships...

626
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:27,516
couple dead guys in plastic.

627
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,952
And you don't see anything else?

628
01:24:29,962 --> 01:24:31,229
Nothing else.

629
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:34,163
Let me know when you do.

630
01:24:35,768 --> 01:24:38,468
Love those toenails, by the way.

631
01:24:40,406 --> 01:24:41,536
Yeah?

632
01:24:42,241 --> 01:24:43,769
Predator Pink.

633
01:24:44,911 --> 01:24:46,644
Matches your nipples.

634
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:51,009
Why are we even listening
to this big fuckstick?

635
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:54,851
Can we just detach his head, please?

636
01:24:55,154 --> 01:24:56,887
Here's what's gonna happen.

637
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:00,522
The next 60 seconds, you're gonna watch
your own head drop into that box.

638
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:03,161
Nothing...

639
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:07,063
nothing is gonna keep you
from that special place in Hell.

640
01:25:09,702 --> 01:25:12,671
Maybe in the last minute of your life,
you want to be something more...

641
01:25:12,672 --> 01:25:15,031
than a goddamn savage!!

642
01:25:16,876 --> 01:25:18,768
Gimme some fucking answers!

643
01:25:19,946 --> 01:25:21,144
Please!

644
01:25:30,556 --> 01:25:34,019
Well, is there anything you'd like
to add on the subject I just raised?

645
01:25:53,946 --> 01:25:55,042
Time's up.

646
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,582
Time's up.

647
01:26:04,623 --> 01:26:05,719
He's all yours.

648
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:14,530
Hold him down.

649
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:40,683
End of game, dude.

650
01:26:49,668 --> 01:26:51,367
More dingo-dongos maybe.

651
01:26:55,841 --> 01:26:56,800
Fuck it.

652
01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:02,177
I know what's coming.

653
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:07,416
Called to find you.
The serpents...

654
01:27:28,174 --> 01:27:29,498
Spotlight!

655
01:27:56,602 --> 01:27:58,096
Like I said...

656
01:27:59,572 --> 01:28:02,238
it ain't me you gotta worry about.

657
01:28:06,545 --> 01:28:08,506
What is it?
What's out there?

658
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:10,445
I don't know.

659
01:28:11,517 --> 01:28:13,148
Fucked up or something out there.

660
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:17,078
It ain't right.
It's coming our way.

661
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:29,128
Whatever they are,
they ain't so hard to kill.

662
01:29:10,176 --> 01:29:11,340
What the fuck?!

663
01:29:32,698 --> 01:29:33,726
Fuck!

664
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,307
No more holes, please.

665
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:26,547
Now here's what's gonna happen.

666
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:31,148
In 60 seconds you're gonna
take these chains off me.

667
01:30:31,523 --> 01:30:34,553
We're gonna make a play for
those nodes and get off this rock.

668
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:37,219
But somewhere along the line...

669
01:30:38,564 --> 01:30:40,729
when it gets really bad...

670
01:30:42,968 --> 01:30:44,292
Johns...

671
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:49,365
is gonna fold
just like Little Johns did.

672
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,968
Then when it's all over...

673
01:30:53,646 --> 01:30:56,608
and the rest of you are ready
for Dead Animal Pickup...

674
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:00,718
I'm gonna go balls deep into Dahl.

675
01:31:02,187 --> 01:31:04,546
But only because she asked me to.

676
01:31:06,392 --> 01:31:07,920
Sweet-like.

677
01:31:10,696 --> 01:31:14,557
What does he mean, "When things go bad"?
This doesn't qualify as bad?!

678
01:31:15,634 --> 01:31:18,630
What the fuck is happening?
How fucked are we?

679
01:31:19,038 --> 01:31:21,135
Who knows how long it will rain?

680
01:31:23,108 --> 01:31:27,401
Or just how many of them
are buried out there?

681
01:31:29,248 --> 01:31:33,075
He saw it. He saw it with those eyes
of his and he didn't tell us what.

682
01:31:43,362 --> 01:31:46,563
One ship for you, one for me.

683
01:31:47,366 --> 01:31:50,066
I need to know that
these nodes are retrievable.

684
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:54,336
And I need to know we have a deal.

685
01:31:58,911 --> 01:32:00,269
We got a deal.

686
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,347
The chains stay on.

687
01:32:23,302 --> 01:32:24,933
Why don't we sit this one out?

688
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:29,337
Okay, okay.

689
01:32:31,276 --> 01:32:33,476
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up...

690
01:32:36,248 --> 01:32:37,412
Good doggie.

691
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:18,051
Holy... shit.

692
01:33:21,093 --> 01:33:22,690
Yeah.

693
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,152
Let's cut him loose.

694
01:33:26,532 --> 01:33:28,299
That was five seconds.

695
01:33:29,134 --> 01:33:31,527
I like to be a man of my word.

696
01:33:34,339 --> 01:33:36,937
How about you, Johns?

697
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:25,189
He shall give His angels charge over me,
keep me in all His grace...

698
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:27,210
- Shut the noise, Luna!
- As long as I live.

699
01:34:27,392 --> 01:34:31,924
You know, I think the angels
are here protecting me.

700
01:34:32,197 --> 01:34:34,165
And if they're here,
watching over me...

701
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:34,932
Maybe they'll deliver us...

702
01:34:34,933 --> 01:34:36,334
- all from this crazy-shit place.
- That shit is creeping everybody out...

703
01:34:36,335 --> 01:34:39,036
- so shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up, Vargas!

704
01:34:39,037 --> 01:34:40,463
Leave the kid alone.

705
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:51,181
Where the hell did that...?
Jesus Christ!

706
01:34:52,351 --> 01:34:53,481
No, no, no, no!

707
01:34:56,421 --> 01:34:59,023
What the fuck is wrong with you,
you crazy bastard!

708
01:34:59,024 --> 01:35:00,324
You could have killed me!

709
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:01,557
Got it, didn't I?

710
01:35:10,202 --> 01:35:11,594
Vargas, get up.

711
01:35:12,838 --> 01:35:14,696
Vargas, get up.
Come on, let's go!

712
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:18,739
Vargas, come on, man. Walk it off.
Let's go. It's just a little one.

713
01:35:18,977 --> 01:35:20,869
Small ones are the worst.

714
01:35:22,447 --> 01:35:24,408
They save the most venom.

715
01:35:37,496 --> 01:35:38,558
And kid?

716
01:35:39,998 --> 01:35:41,560
Leave God out of this.

717
01:35:42,167 --> 01:35:44,662
He wants no part of what happens next.

718
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,307
I forgot to mention...

719
01:35:58,817 --> 01:36:00,345
there's no weapons for you.

720
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:09,922
You think you can ride
one of these things?

721
01:36:10,462 --> 01:36:12,559
I'll ride it like I stole it.

722
01:36:27,245 --> 01:36:28,375
I'll take flank.

723
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,620
If Riddick comes back here
without us...

724
01:36:41,994 --> 01:36:44,694
you go ahead,
you kill him on general principle.

725
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:48,096
Is that before or after
I'm supposed to fuck him?

726
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:23,654
You asshole motherfucker!
Just sitting there watching!

727
01:39:23,655 --> 01:39:27,413
Would have covered you,
but you said "no weapons".

728
01:39:33,632 --> 01:39:36,662
I bet you want those nodes, Johns.

729
01:40:12,337 --> 01:40:15,117
Hey, I don't suppose you took
the time to do this for him, huh?

730
01:40:17,776 --> 01:40:20,271
This may come
as a shock to you, Johns...

731
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,872
but I didn't ghost your son.

732
01:40:26,084 --> 01:40:28,409
He seemed set on killing himself.

733
01:40:32,057 --> 01:40:33,551
What the fuck does that mean?

734
01:40:34,626 --> 01:40:35,915
Morphine.

735
01:40:37,696 --> 01:40:39,554
Your son liked his morphine.

736
01:40:40,599 --> 01:40:42,230
Liked it twice a day.

737
01:40:43,435 --> 01:40:45,430
Didn't know your son was a junkie?

738
01:40:49,374 --> 01:40:51,335
Johns was like most mercs.

739
01:40:52,143 --> 01:40:55,571
They look all stand-up and do-right...

740
01:40:56,047 --> 01:40:58,747
until you cut them open
and you find something missing.

741
01:40:59,851 --> 01:41:02,016
In his case, a spine.

742
01:41:03,655 --> 01:41:06,947
I don't have to listen to this shit!
That's not the man I knew.

743
01:41:07,292 --> 01:41:08,991
Then you didn't know your son.

744
01:41:14,766 --> 01:41:16,363
He wanted to kill a kid.

745
01:41:18,436 --> 01:41:20,226
To save his own skin.

746
01:41:20,972 --> 01:41:22,569
I had a problem with that.

747
01:41:24,276 --> 01:41:25,975
You expect me to believe...

748
01:41:26,811 --> 01:41:29,579
my son was gonna kill
a child to save his own life?

749
01:41:32,284 --> 01:41:35,917
Morphine makes the brain soft.
Heart wrong.

750
01:41:39,591 --> 01:41:41,051
I don't fucking buy it!

751
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,228
I just can't believe
that my son's the bad guy

752
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:47,726
in this fucking demented
fairy tale of yours.

753
01:41:50,302 --> 01:41:52,194
No reason to lie now...

754
01:41:55,073 --> 01:41:56,305
Johns.

755
01:41:59,477 --> 01:42:01,039
Either one of us.

756
01:42:30,175 --> 01:42:32,576
Thanks for starting
the killing spree for me, Riddick.

757
01:42:32,577 --> 01:42:34,105
But I'll take it from here.

758
01:43:27,332 --> 01:43:28,758
Jamoke.

759
01:43:33,638 --> 01:43:36,065
So that blade you buried
was meant for me?

760
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:40,468
Anyone who deserved it, really.

761
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:45,577
We've got a problem, Riddick...

762
01:43:47,218 --> 01:43:49,110
because I've got two nodes here.

763
01:43:49,587 --> 01:43:51,013
We've got one hog.

764
01:43:51,923 --> 01:43:56,284
And I sure as shit am not
riding bitch with you again.

765
01:43:58,263 --> 01:43:59,587
One hog?

766
01:44:01,066 --> 01:44:03,129
You sure about that, Johns?

767
01:44:08,807 --> 01:44:11,337
He pulled the goddamn turbine pin!

768
01:44:12,944 --> 01:44:14,711
You just figured that out?

769
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:18,940
Diaz was gonna take the nodes
for himself and ghost me.

770
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:21,819
He was gonna leave you out here alone.

771
01:44:22,654 --> 01:44:24,046
So what now?

772
01:44:31,663 --> 01:44:33,692
Now we switch to our ground game.

773
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,325
Let's see if that lack of spine
runs in the family.

774
01:45:30,889 --> 01:45:31,814
Reload!

775
01:45:38,663 --> 01:45:39,793
Watch your head.

776
01:45:50,608 --> 01:45:51,408
Go!

777
01:47:54,499 --> 01:47:55,595
I got inbound.

778
01:48:11,215 --> 01:48:12,277
Take this!

779
01:48:13,217 --> 01:48:14,381
Is it just you?

780
01:48:15,787 --> 01:48:18,112
Just slam this thing in.
See if it's still good.

781
01:48:21,759 --> 01:48:22,359
Boss...

782
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,140
Just see if the fucking thing works!
We need to get outta here.

783
01:52:30,608 --> 01:52:34,071
Extraction, 30 seconds or less.
Let's go, let's go!

784
01:53:06,444 --> 01:53:07,938
Let me ask you something...

785
01:53:09,614 --> 01:53:10,812
sweet-like...

786
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:54,882
Lot of good men died here, Riddick.

787
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:59,060
Not sure how I'm supposed
to overlook that. Next time.

788
01:53:59,597 --> 01:54:01,498
Yeah. Things would
have been different

789
01:54:01,499 --> 01:54:04,063
if they weren't trying
to put my head in a box.

790
01:54:06,871 --> 01:54:08,570
So where to now, Riddick?

791
01:54:09,573 --> 01:54:13,809
You know what? Fuck that. Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

792
01:54:14,345 --> 01:54:16,636
<i>I'll tell you this, Johns.</i>

793
01:54:16,714 --> 01:54:20,177
<i>Sooner or later,
we all have to head home.</i>

794
01:54:20,918 --> 01:54:23,311
<i>Tell Dahl to keep it warm for me.</i>

795
01:54:23,954 --> 01:54:25,551
And Johns...

796
01:54:26,657 --> 01:54:28,857
you keep a strong spine.

797
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,050
