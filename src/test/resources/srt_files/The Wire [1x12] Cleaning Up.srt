1
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,081
How is she?

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,679
In and out of the morphine drip.

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,352
They got her stabilized is all I know.

4
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,622
Go on in.

5
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:29,987
No.

6
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,529
Unfreeze your ass off that wall, then.

7
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,630
Either pay your respects,
or get your head back into this case.

8
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,437
-Fuck this case.
-Fuck it?

9
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:43,835
Now you're just gonna, what,
call off your little crusade?

10
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,708
Is that what you think it was? A crusade?

11
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,682
Avon Barksdale was a way
to show everyone how smart I was...

12
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,879
and how fucked up
the department is, that's all.

13
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,587
Just put Jimmy McNulty
up on your shoulders...

14
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:59,717
march him around the room,
break out the keg.

15
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,765
It was never about
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.

16
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,630
It was all about me.

17
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,967
You think I didn't know that?

18
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,933
You think we all didn't know?

19
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:19,706
Listen, this case is gonna move forward...

20
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,512
with you or without you.

21
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,173
This case got her shot.

22
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,808
I put a battery up her ass...

23
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,547
and got her thinking
this case meant something.

24
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:31,385
And you know what?
Burrell, Rawls, and them, they were right.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,787
This case means exactly shit.

26
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,556
I know it meant damn near nothing to me
when you came in beating the drum.

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,225
But now we got that woman
in there, that good police...

28
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,033
breathing through a fucking tube,
because it meant something to her.

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,598
And the shooters who dropped Kima?
They're still in the wind.

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,201
And whoever sent those motherfuckers
into that alley...

31
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,247
he needs to get got, too.

32
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,647
So you can stand there,
dripping with liquor-smell and self-pity...

33
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:00,312
if you got a mind to, but this case...

34
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:03,650
it means something. Now.

35
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,628
You hit them again?

36
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,703
I been calling them all morning.
They ain't hit me back yet.

37
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,398
Damn, we gonna tap out by noon.

38
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,705
Poot! What we got over there?

39
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,509
200, maybe.

40
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,906
What the fuck is this?

41
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,776
What the fuck you think, nigger? Fish food.

42
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,614
Give me my shit.

43
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,491
Heads up.

44
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,859
String.

45
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:27,130
I need your pagers.
All of y'all, the whole crew.

46
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,572
-Who else?
-Sterling, Cass and Manny.

47
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,668
-All right, go get them shits.
-How am I gonna talk to my girl?

48
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,441
Talk to your hand, nigger,
that's the only girl you got.

49
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,483
No more.... Get out of here.

50
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,342
Just get the fuck out of here, man.

51
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:51,052
No more pagers.
Touts, lookouts, off the air, all right?

52
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,453
Nobody gonna use these cell phones
except for you and Bodie...

53
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,723
and y'all don't say shit on these,
you understand me?

54
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,459
We got the numbers
and we the only niggers that need them.

55
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,435
Not your moms, not your girl, nobody.
You feel me?

56
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,232
You use these phones to set up a meet,
go to that meet...

57
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,440
and talk face to face, period.

58
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,410
-So no more pay phones?
-You deaf? I said no phones.

59
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,172
How I'm gonna reach y'all?

60
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,952
All right, top number's for re-ups...

61
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,646
second number's for muscle.

62
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,985
You need me, hit me on the third number.

63
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,082
Learn them shits, then throw that shit away.

64
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,753
-You doing this in the towers, too?
-Doing it everywhere.

65
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,727
Pagers, pay phones is dead.

66
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,388
-All right?
-Yeah.

67
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,061
String.

68
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,835
We need some re-up, man,
we gonna tap out by noon.

69
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,407
Re-up from where? You niggers ain't heard?

70
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,499
Knockos took the main stash.

71
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,239
Why the fuck you think we changing up?

72
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:53,277
Back the fuck up, young'un.
These shits ain't for you.

73
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:57,551
All right.

74
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:02,926
Cool. There you go.

75
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,963
There we go. All right.

76
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,196
The gift of corrected vision.

77
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,639
Compliments of the BPD.

78
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,837
-Dang, y'all are focused.
-What man wouldn't be?

79
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,161
They been cleaning us for the past few days.

80
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,630
-Last night they burned us all the way.
-I knew it.

81
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,325
I fucking knew it.

82
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,699
I swear to God,
I'm in this motherfucker's head.

83
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,931
Not a message since early morning.

84
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,099
Shit, I even had to cut Prez loose.

85
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,540
-Send his ass on down to Annapolis.
-For what?

86
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,511
State campaign finance reports.
I checked all the stuff here.

87
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,844
But I got the feeling
Barksdale's money has legs.

88
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,109
Shit.

89
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,685
All the work we did
to get up on this fucking wire.

90
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:03,120
You don't hit these guys
and expect them to stay in the pocket.

91
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,784
-Plus, they know they dropped a police.
-Then we need to change up, too.

92
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,088
Come on.

93
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,557
Shardene!

94
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,461
Honey, this is Detective McNulty,
who's working with us.

95
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,634
She works at Orlando's,
helping us out there from time to time.

96
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,001
And now I think
that she can see well enough...

97
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,698
to match faces to voices.

98
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,902
Lester, look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm scared of this shit.

99
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,707
Time comes, though,
I know you gonna step up.

100
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,408
We're gonna need Pearlman
to approve her wearing a wire.

101
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,007
-Can I get a cup of coffee?
-What do you take in it?

102
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,781
I'll get it. A little cream, right?

103
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,260
Those knockos motherfuckers
cleaned my shit out.

104
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:47,459
-You can replace product and currency.
-Yeah, he right.

105
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,628
-We gotta focus on what's real, here.
-All of this shit is real.

106
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,697
They wanna put me in a box.

107
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,298
Listen, I think what's important
is to take stock.

108
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,072
Ask yourself what's out there
that can still hurt you.

109
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,874
Where are you weak?

110
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,149
Where you need to clean up?

111
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,449
Think it through.

112
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,753
Start with Orlando, if Orlando rolled.

113
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,920
You know he talked about the club, at least.

114
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,793
That punk-ass nigger
ain't talk about shit else but the club.

115
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,299
That's all he knew about.
He wasn't rolling with us.

116
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:22,736
We kept him on the outside.

117
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,733
So you walk away from the club.

118
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,363
You're not on the license,
you're not a listed owner.

119
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,271
They can't make a connect.

120
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,241
When did this shit start up?

121
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,143
About the time that
your nephew beat that charge.

122
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,745
After, maybe when they found that witness
with the lead in his dome...

123
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,047
the shit hit the newspapers.

124
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:43,646
But around that time,
the cops was on our shit.

125
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,885
The security guard,
the one whose testimony sprung D'Angelo--

126
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,517
-Nakeisha Lyles?
-Yeah.

127
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,097
Bug-eyed ass bitch. But we hooked that up.

128
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,027
-So she can still hurt you, right?
-Yeah.

129
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,560
The point is anybody
who can hurt you can be put into play.

130
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,736
-The less I hear, the better.
-All right, yo.

131
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,766
Hey, yo, lock that door?

132
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,517
So we got Bird and Bey.

133
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:16,278
-Bird will stand tall.
-He already in jail, and Bey about to go, too.

134
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,551
And Wee-Bey hard like a rock.

135
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,291
And we got Savino.

136
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,124
Savino know it ain't nothing
but an Arm and Hammer charge.

137
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,222
I mean, he ain't gonna flip out
over a motherfucking three years.

138
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,357
True.

139
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:31,564
Then we got that shit with Orlando,
and the only problem there was Little Man.

140
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,230
Was.

141
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,406
Who else?

142
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,446
It's over, your wire's cold.

143
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,449
The court orders give me
a total of 90 days on five phones.

144
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,813
I'm doing the full 90.

145
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,288
You want to sit listening to a bunch
of broke-ass pay phones, have at it.

146
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,824
But you don't need
all that manpower to do it.

147
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,656
You want some bodies back,
I'll send a couple, no problem.

148
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,595
Hold on, Lieutenant.
I gave you those people.

149
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,667
I decide who comes back.

150
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,667
But feel free to speak your mind,
if it were up to you.

151
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,468
He asked you a question, Lieutenant.

152
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,509
I have no opinion. Take your pick.

153
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,706
What's the name of that
old detective from Pawnshop?

154
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:21,186
And that young one,
Valchek's brain-dead son-in-law.

155
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,857
Freamon, Pryzbylewski.

156
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,390
Keep them.

157
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,863
Send back Sydnor and Santangelo.

158
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,600
And, Lieutenant, if you want
to do anything beyond...

159
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,796
Iisten to those dead phones...

160
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,238
you need to brief me first.

161
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,982
You did good, Cedric.

162
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:54,110
You play your cards right, all the work
you did over the past few months...

163
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,246
will speak volumes for you.

164
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,848
And Maj. Spurgeon is saying
that he's retiring at the end of November.

165
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,791
Which opens up the Northwest Command.

166
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,157
That's right.

167
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,497
Hi, Ronnie. Come in. Sit.

168
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,063
-Sheila, send Patrick in.
-Yes, sir.

169
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,164
-Anything up?
-With me?

170
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,471
Same shit, different file.

171
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,445
-How about the Barksdale thing?
-You've got my office reports?

172
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,516
Wire's dead, but we're looking into a bug
in the man's nightclub.

173
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,108
Aside from that, you're doing what?

174
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,949
Pulling campaign finance reports
for every politician...

175
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,717
in the city of Baltimore, right?

176
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:31,813
I am?

177
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,117
We are?

178
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,123
And making calls to some contributors...

179
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,729
asking questions,
doing background checks.

180
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,169
I don't know anything about this.

181
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,296
I mean, Ronnie,
where the fuck is all this going?

182
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,442
Those are public reports, right? I mean....

183
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,703
No one on that detail
has come to me for any kind of subpoena.

184
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,010
You got back-doored, too?

185
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,248
Just so there's no misunderstanding...

186
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,679
I want to give you this.

187
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,590
Copies of checks on the account
of my re-election committee...

188
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:11,391
representing the return
of five separate contributions...

189
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,988
totaling $4,500.

190
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,399
Also copies of the checks...

191
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,733
from the donor are represented in there, too.

192
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,706
Kind of like Caesar's wife and all that shit.

193
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,576
The only thing that we could come up with
were those five checks.

194
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,171
And I don't know those people,
and I don't know why they gave.

195
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,807
That money's gonna be returned
to the donors immediately.

196
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,443
Guys, listen to me.

197
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,883
I don't know a fucking thing...

198
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,016
about anyone looking
at campaign contributions.

199
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,024
Be that as it may...

200
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,432
this should make it clear
that our hands are clean.

201
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,024
Ronnie, I want you to take that back
to whoever's on the hunt...

202
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,761
and I want you to tell them
they've got no quarrel with me.

203
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,011
What's up, String?

204
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,981
So y'all want to get with me?

205
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,180
Yeah, we need to holler at your boy...

206
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,621
you know, the one
that dimed on Omar's bitch.

207
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,454
Can't recall his name.

208
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,854
Which one?

209
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,089
The one that was at the Greek's that night.

210
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,531
-And we paid him for the lookout.
-What y'all need him for?

211
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,731
What's it to you?

212
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,399
-You ain't got to worry about him.
-Say what?

213
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,873
He's gone, he's out the game.

214
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,500
Out the game?

215
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,512
Yo, the man asked you a simple question.

216
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,508
I don't mean y'all no disrespect.
You know I don't.

217
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,850
I am sitting here telling you
that the boy is out the game.

218
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,516
And even if he wasn't out the game,
he wouldn't be no problem.

219
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,560
But you know we just want
to talk to him, Dee.

220
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,692
Let the boy be.

221
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,533
Just let him be.

222
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,656
Honey, just leave the damn thing alone.

223
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,592
-Where'd you get these, man?
-Prevas.

224
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,392
Broadway market?

225
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,493
-Best chili dogs in the city.
-No, man, not even.

226
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,473
I'll give you $10
if you can name a better dog.

227
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,302
-George's Lunch on Light Street.
-The Greek joint?

228
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,903
That place closed back when you were
still sucking on your mama's nipples.

229
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,916
My mama's nipples?
I was sucking on them plums last night.

230
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,485
You owe me $10.

231
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,749
I said, name a better dog
you can have today, not in world history.

232
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,689
-You just said a better dog.
-You go get that dog right now.

233
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,885
-You cannot go get that now.
-And you tell me...

234
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,791
-the best fucking dog.
-Physically--

235
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,093
Can you please keep it down?
I can't hear a goddamn thing!

236
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,364
You'd know how much I got...

237
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,442
if you laid something on me.

238
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,977
-You like that freeze?
-If you holding.

239
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,144
I'm fixing to be.
That's why I'm here, you know?

240
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,474
To discuss some things.

241
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,253
When you done discussing, you come back.

242
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,959
All right, then.
Hold that pose right there, shorty.

243
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,062
I'm gonna hook you up with some uncut.

244
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,901
Y'all niggers talk too damn much, man.

245
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,006
Who the fuck is she? Housing police?

246
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:24,948
No, she's one of them civilians
they got doing security.

247
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:29,445
-Housing cops wear the gray uniforms.
-So she's not armed or nothing.

248
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,156
Do she look it?

249
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,524
You leaving early?

250
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:41,066
I was early, I worked the lunch crowd.

251
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,605
She's out.

252
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,482
-Anything?
-Table scraps.

253
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,382
What we want is being said in that office.

254
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:04,685
There's no reason for Shardene
to be in there long enough for us to get it.

255
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,287
-Take it out, I can't do this anymore.
-You won't have to, darling.

256
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,194
I think they'll look at me and know.
I need to quit.

257
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,200
I don't need you wearing
this wire, all right, honey?

258
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,770
I just need you to go in there
and do one more thing.

259
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,832
Look at this country nigger.

260
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,871
-Damn, Wallace.
-Wally!

261
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,247
He kept crying till I sent him bus money.

262
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,514
All right. I just got tired
of that same old country scenery.

263
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,179
It was just too slow for me.

264
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,917
Yeah, but did you get
some of that country ass?

265
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,788
And if he did, it was on four legs.

266
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:45,126
Nigger, they got no farms down there, man,
but they did have some Bamas though.

267
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,098
They got their Saturday night
shit down at Sears.

268
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,364
-They was like, you know--
-Tears, right? You were about to cry.

269
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,995
That where you got them Die-Hards?

270
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,802
-Man, these Timbs.
-Yeah, they Timbs.

271
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,139
I can see the tree on the side of them.

272
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,872
So you gonna put me back on the money?

273
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:04,712
Hold. Look, if we do put you back on...

274
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,581
you have to start as lookout, man.

275
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,280
You lost your spot
when you bucked town, dawg.

276
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,789
Come on, a real man
would stay with his people...

277
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,052
he wouldn't run at the first sight
of some blood.

278
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,060
Y'all can still holler 5-0, right?

279
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,029
If he want back on the money,
he back on the money.

280
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,724
If he want it.

281
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,268
My man might be thinking of going
back to Edmondson...

282
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,304
Iike we talked about, right?

283
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,771
Come on, nigger, let's walk.

284
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,847
Dawg, you ain't cornholed
no animal for real, did you?

285
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,441
-Go ahead, Poot.
-You're stupid.

286
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,385
Don't be fucking with my Sean John.

287
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,985
-So who caught it?
-Garvey.

288
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,722
He knows about the whole witness angle...

289
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,920
but he doesn't want to run it up
to the bosses until he knows more.

290
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,260
Why ace Nakeisha Lyles now?

291
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,333
Because now they know we're for real.

292
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,925
Avon's cleaning house all the way.

293
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:59,562
First the phones go dead
and then anyone he thinks...

294
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,606
we might be able to flip.

295
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,842
What about the boy?

296
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,910
Fuck me.

297
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,921
We took him to the shore Friday
and the plan was to bring him back up...

298
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,457
-on the Monday for the grand jury.
-And what happened?

299
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,618
-Greggs got shot.
-Trooper Reese?

300
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,924
This is Lieutenant Daniels
with the Baltimore Department.

301
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,022
Is there someone that can
go near Cambridge...

302
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,260
check on a kid we got stashed down there?

303
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,064
-Call him.
-No, there's no phone there.

304
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,435
-Can you hang on?
-I'll hold, yeah.

305
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,067
Have Sydnor pull a car from motor pool.

306
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,906
We get the kid back up here tonight,
he sleeps on my sofa...

307
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,412
and we grand-jury him in the morning.

308
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,815
-What about your stripper?
-The woman's got heart.

309
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,311
I mean, I want her protected.
No more bodies, hear?

310
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,252
I got room at my place,
she can lay up with me.

311
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,690
-I got no problem with that.
-Remember who you are, Detective.

312
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,663
Protect and serve, Lieutenant.

313
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:05,170
I'm saying, this here game,
it ain't gonna work for you no more, man.

314
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,740
You leaving, you stirred up some shit.

315
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,234
-I'm saying it ain't your fault.
-Dee, look.

316
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:16,543
I appreciate what you trying to say and all,
but I grew up in the courts, all right?

317
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,447
I been with them niggers since forever.

318
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,917
This is home, right?

319
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,417
You ain't hearing me, Wallace.

320
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,593
Anybody asks you whether
you in this game...

321
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,927
you tell them you in it for life, all right?

322
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,061
You play it hard, you play it tight...

323
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:38,433
and make sure niggers know
you gonna stand by your people.

324
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,439
No loose talk, no second thoughts,
and no snitching.

325
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,609
Play it like that.

326
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,715
-What you doing down in the PJ's, you lost?
-I'm looking for you.

327
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:59,258
-You know I be down here working.
-A working man got to eat.

328
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,658
-My favorite spicy fish cakes?
-On the saltines with the mustard.

329
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,823
You gonna make me cry, you know.

330
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,663
I need to get up out of here
and get back to it.

331
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,662
-You be safe.
-You, too.

332
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,069
All right.

333
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,366
This here.

334
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,740
Sterling's, baby, we're about to feast.

335
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,645
What the hell is Sterling's?

336
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,378
Sterling's, up on 29th Street?
Don't you know nothing?

337
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,614
Shit, if it ain't up on the Westside,
I don't know shit.

338
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,049
'Cause this shit...

339
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,455
this is me, yo, right here.

340
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,555
Who was that, your new girl or something?

341
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,598
No, nigger, that's my mom.

342
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,469
You know Senator Davis?

343
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,540
No, sir.

344
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,606
Lieutenant.

345
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:58,015
Clay wanted to meet you,
see if there was any help he can offer.

346
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,713
Help?

347
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,018
Your people are apparently
pulling finance reports...

348
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,059
and checking up on some
of the contributors.

349
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,955
I wanted to reassure you on that front.

350
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,726
I'm not involved in drugs, Lieutenant.

351
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:15,826
Good.

352
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,765
And this business with the senator's driver.

353
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,501
Mr. Price, Damien.

354
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,135
Day-Day.

355
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:29,111
This business with Mr. Price,
this is a misunderstanding...

356
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,877
that is really of no concern to the police.

357
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,384
He had $20,000 of cash on him...

358
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,952
delivered out of a project tower
by a known drug suspect.

359
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,658
The money was banded
and manicured by denomination.

360
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,529
There's no crime here.

361
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,664
That was money that Damien
already had on him...

362
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,566
when he drove down to Franklin Terrace.

363
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,538
Money from a cash-bar fundraiser
the previous weekend.

364
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,633
We filed an amended
finance report that shows--

365
00:22:58,745 --> 00:22:59,871
Fine.

366
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,776
There's no probable cause
for a search of Mr. Price.

367
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:07,248
I think we are in agreement on that.

368
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,113
No, there was PC for the search.

369
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:14,319
You're saying you have evidence
that a senatorial aide is involved in drugs?

370
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,620
I'm saying we had reason to stop Mr. Price...

371
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,426
and effect a body search,
after which we discovered...

372
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,525
$20,000 in cash in banded, manicured bills.

373
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,365
That's all I'm saying.

374
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:30,200
Will you explain to this motherfucker
just what it is he's doing here?

375
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,710
-Lt. Daniels--
-Excuse me, sir.

376
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,336
But it's pretty basic.

377
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,181
If the senator is not involved
in anything illegal...

378
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,511
then he doesn't need to worry.

379
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,813
I can't be any clearer about it than that.

380
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,649
Fool, what do you think?

381
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,389
That we know anything
about who gives money?

382
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:49,018
That we give a damn about
who they are or what they want?

383
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:52,664
We have no way of running down
them or their stories.

384
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,590
We don't care.

385
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:58,102
We just cash the damn checks,
count the votes, and move on.

386
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,403
Anything else, Deputy Burrell?

387
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,479
Gentlemen.

388
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,982
You need to put his ass on a foot post
so far out in the sticks...

389
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:22,528
that he's gonna see
the Philadelphia cops walking towards him.

390
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,625
Now you just ain't talking to me now, Erv.

391
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:27,563
You talking to the Mayor...

392
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,534
the city caucus, the state central committee.

393
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,539
And right now,
you got your hand in our pocket.

394
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,401
Eighteen, baby!

395
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,283
Eighteen with a bullet, baby.

396
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,247
Det. Sgt. Hauk reporting for duty, sir.

397
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,955
And the best part? Carver's 37.

398
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,959
You know, it helps
if you know them by the numbers.

399
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:58,223
It makes you sound more professional.

400
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,355
Fucking Carver...

401
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,866
he gets back from in-service training,
he's gonna kiss the stripes...

402
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,766
I'm gonna make him kiss the stripes.

403
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,772
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

404
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,468
-Sgt. Hauk?
-God help us.

405
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,242
-Daniels.
-Daniels, this is Trooper Reese.

406
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,753
Grandmother says this kid's
been gone two days.

407
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,157
Wallace is out of pocket. Two days.

408
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,325
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

409
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,226
Ain't no re-up in the towers, neither?

410
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:39,861
Shop dead, yo.

411
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,553
-What up, man?
-Same old.

412
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,326
What's up with that boy?

413
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,895
He's just a punk, that's all.

414
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,104
Dee put him back on count though.

415
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,537
Word? I heard he was out the game.

416
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,469
He was, but he back now.

417
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,868
Where he been at?

418
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,577
Down his granny house, he says.

419
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,776
Right, his granny house.

420
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,414
I heard he damn near shit his pants...

421
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:31,217
when he saw what happened
to Omar's bitch.

422
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,416
He just ain't built for this, you know.
His heart pump Kool-Aid.

423
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,691
Right. What about you?

424
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,833
You built for this shit?

425
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,331
No doubt.

426
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,634
You ready to put the work in?

427
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,276
You got heat?

428
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,850
All right, soldier.

429
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,921
It's clear upstairs.

430
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,100
No extension cords. No juice boxes.

431
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,708
No Wallace.

432
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,241
Dang, boy, Chink Bob's...

433
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,816
never be putting no napkins in the bag.

434
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,312
Motherfucker, because
napkins expensive and shit.

435
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,217
So is my money.

436
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:12,155
All right, come on, go. Something to eat?

437
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,823
Y'all know what's here.

438
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:18,756
Let's go, y'all need
to get up in this Chinese food...

439
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,799
'cause, you know, I'm looking
kind of needy right about now.

440
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,665
What you listening to?
Hold up, take them plates first.

441
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,333
Big Tymers, their new video
on 106th and Park.

442
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,377
-106th and Park?
-The joint is vicious.

443
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:33,467
-Yeah.
-For real?

444
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,843
-What they call you?
-Buff, 'cause I got the stuff.

445
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,313
You got the stuff?

446
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,919
Buff, you need to get up
in these egg rolls or something.

447
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:40,886
Buff, you need to get up
in these egg rolls or something.

448
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,815
Any word on the kid?

449
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,982
I rolled around Cambridge
all night with his B of l.

450
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,560
If he's down there, he ain't got no profile.

451
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,289
We got lookouts to every car
in the Western and Central.

452
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,093
We're trying for an address on his mother.

453
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,434
-Detective.
-Lieutenant.

454
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,569
Wire's dead...

455
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,970
so we've been ordered
to begin sending bodies home.

456
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,202
Sydnor, we have a little longer,
because Cantrell still owes me.

457
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,838
-You okay with Rawls?
-I gave him his clearance, right?

458
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,972
What's he gonna do to me?

459
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,111
Keep it warm, Sanny.

460
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,456
What's that?

461
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,993
Plans for what is now Orlando's.
The upper floors.

462
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,653
This is the property next door.

463
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,823
-How'd you get them so quick?
-CoStar search.

464
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,457
Plan is to get a remote mike into the office.

465
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,593
Maybe even some fiber-optics.

466
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:33,865
Only we don't know
where Avon's office is yet.

467
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,168
Which is where Shardene
helps us out in a big way.

468
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,574
What she gonna do? Take out a tape
and ask Avon to hold the other end?

469
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,806
Ain't none of y'all ever been in the military?

470
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,280
How do you learn a 30-inch, quick-time?

471
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:50,979
Draft-dodging peace-freaks.

472
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:55,187
-Get me a ruler and some string.
-Why me?

473
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,030
Why?

474
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:10,130
-Because the man said so, that's why.
-Wallace ain't no snitch.

475
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,734
Man, how you know?
How you know where he been running to?

476
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:17,174
He was getting high. I've seen him cop.

477
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:20,548
He probably went down to the shore
to clean that shit up.

478
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,921
Man, if he using,
then you know he ain't reliable.

479
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,581
Come on, think.

480
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:30,589
Look, the man gave the word, all right?
We either step up or we step the fuck off.

481
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,089
That's the game.

482
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,496
That's the fucking game.

483
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,806
Cedric.

484
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:52,947
You ever hear of an elected official
in Baltimore giving money back?

485
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:58,419
Whatever you're doing
scared my boss shitless.

486
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,286
He calls me in and hands me that.

487
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:11,259
Forgive me for prying
into the details of our investigation.

488
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,067
I know, it's annoying.
But what the hell are you guys doing?

489
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,232
Yeah?

490
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,773
Is that Avon's money?

491
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,377
Eastside addresses...

492
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,815
but maybe Barksdale has fronts
we don't know about.

493
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,752
-State's attorney's returning this?
-Fast as he can.

494
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,915
Y'all are stirring some shit here.
Why didn't you tell me?

495
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,759
Aren't you better off that we didn't?

496
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,252
I remember my mom used to bring me here.

497
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,378
We used to go to a place
called Fruit Fantasy.

498
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:06,583
-Like orange soda, some shit like that?
-No, these shits was fresh.

499
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,751
My mom used to pour
mad Bacardi in hers though.

500
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,556
Wasn't much she didn't pour it into.

501
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:13,791
Look at you, talking about your mama
like you're still a kid.

502
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,366
I got to thinking on her.

503
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,527
Your ass ain't got to be hard
all the goddamn time, neither.

504
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,696
Soft link break the chain.

505
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,773
What are you, a boy or a man?

506
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,110
I'm a man.

507
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,415
So what are we gonna do, man,
go have some fun?

508
00:32:56,742 --> 00:33:00,143
Okay, on this floor.
It's the second room from the rear.

509
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,778
The stairs start 30 paces from the front...

510
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:05,442
there's 24 stairs, about a foot each.

511
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,382
When you get to the top floor...

512
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,784
it's eight paces to the door
of the dressing room...

513
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:12,084
and then another 10 to the back room.

514
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,318
80 to 1 10 in from the front.

515
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:20,992
Third floor of this building is vacant.

516
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:24,326
Otherwise we'd need a warrant.

517
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,840
-$15.
-Here take $10.

518
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,171
-$15.
-Motherfucker, I don't see no meter.

519
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:33,142
Get the fuck out of here.

520
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,981
It's 2:30 in the morning.

521
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:45,218
Easy now. Hole only needs
to be as big as your finger.

522
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,088
Not those Esskay sausage-looking
fingers you got.

523
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,423
You know what big hands mean.

524
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,598
You know what big hands mean, right?

525
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,794
Lieutenant...

526
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,870
I just pulled a fresh address
for Wallace's mother.

527
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,763
We're okay here.

528
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:07,609
Where y'all at?

529
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,452
All right, when I find y'all, y'all gonna get it.

530
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,383
You better come out now.

531
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,590
Where y'all at?

532
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,494
Look, I'm not even playing
with y'all right about now.

533
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,933
You hear me?

534
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:44,844
Game over. Where the fuck y'all at?

535
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:47,911
When I find y'all, I'm beating your asses.

536
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,544
Now where y'all at?

537
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,082
Don't let me find y'all.

538
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,662
Check this, Poot.
Little Man left his player and shit.

539
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:20,810
You a weak-ass nigger, man.

540
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,012
You should've stayed down
in the country, man.

541
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,592
Y'all my niggers, yo.

542
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,661
You fucking brought this on yourself.

543
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:31,992
-We boys!
-You brought this on yourself.

544
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,962
Why it gotta be like this?

545
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,999
You my niggers from B.C., remember that?

546
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:40,765
Come on, wetting your fucking pants,
like you a little boy.

547
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:44,036
Be a man! Stand up
like a motherfucking man.

548
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,740
-Y'all my niggers.
-You said you a fucking man.

549
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,746
-Stand up straight!
-That's us, man.

550
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,819
Do it goddamnit, if you....

551
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,957
Darcia Wallace? We're looking for your son.

552
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,360
Thought you might help us out
as to his whereabouts.

553
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:40,659
Where-a-who?

554
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:43,360
Shit, I be looking for that
smart little nigger, too.

555
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:44,936
Boy took me for $10.

556
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,028
-Recently?
-What's going on out there?

557
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,265
Nothing.

558
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:53,744
Couple of police interrupting me,
while I'm trying to get my drink on.

559
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,370
Your son might be in some danger.

560
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:57,813
He gonna be in some danger
right here if he shows up.

561
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,146
Snatched that $10
out my purse without asking.

562
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,278
-I'll slap the bright out his eyes.
-Here's my card.

563
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,416
You run into him, you call me.

564
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,509
-Y'all got ajeep?
-Over there, man.

565
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,986
All right, let's see what we got here.

566
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,855
He's packing shit up.

567
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,738
What you scratching your head for, man?

568
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,943
How y'all get the safe in here,
and you can't get it out?

569
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,046
Just dial 91 1 and talk to whoever pick up.

570
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,816
Don't say your name or nothing.

571
00:38:11,924 --> 00:38:14,620
Just say there's been
an animal hurt inside the house...

572
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,523
and then you hang up.

573
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,334
What up? So what do you need from me?

574
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:32,104
I need you to run up to N. Y.C.
to pick up a little something.

575
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,072
Look, I know we tapped and all.

576
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:38,615
Shit, everybody waiting on the re-up,
but I never made that run before.

577
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:41,515
Listen, I feel like I don't have
that many people around me...

578
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,019
I could really trust.

579
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,487
Not like I can kin. You follow me?

580
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,817
-All right?
-How much is it?

581
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,293
We just need to maintain.

582
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,194
Put out enough so we can
keep hold of them towers.

583
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,095
-When?
-Tonight.

584
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:04,668
All right.

585
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:06,975
What am I driving?

586
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,537
-A rental, no flash.
-Where from?

587
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:14,608
I don't know where from, man,
one of those places by the airport.

588
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,416
-Yeah.
-We got something real.

589
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,883
-I'm on my way.
-All right.

590
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,437
Shit!

591
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,881
-Which one?
-The rental there, the Taurus.

592
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:58,989
I gotta say, Lieutenant,
you got mad suction with the federales.

593
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,251
Yeah, Daniels.

594
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:34,863
Where?

595
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:39,731
Wallace?

596
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,439
Poor fucking kid.

597
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:30,415
With Wallace gone,
that's Stringer out of the box.

598
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,534
He was in there
changing his fucking clothes.

599
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,862
You believe that?

600
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,867
Boy had to get himself correct.

601
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,581
We're on. No need for an eyeball.

602
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,916
Let the satellite do the work.

603
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,739
How about I call my lawyer...

604
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:25,238
have him explain
that whole profiling thing to you?

605
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:28,071
Mr. Barksdale, our tollbooth cameras...

606
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,944
have you on the G.W. Bridge at 2310 hours...

607
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,616
then re-entering
the turnpike at the same exit...

608
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,015
35 minutes later.

609
00:42:35,454 --> 00:42:38,753
Why did you drive all the way
to New York for half an hour?

610
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,925
Step out of the car, sir.

611
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:44,395
Keep your hands where I can see them.

612
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:47,260
Turn around, face the car,
put your hands on the roof.

613
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:49,765
-Are you carrying any weapons, sir?
-No.

614
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,631
-Any knives, any needles?
-No.

615
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,204
Any illegal substances
I should know about?

616
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,604
Okay. Spread your legs back.

617
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,066
Spread your legs back more.

618
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:06,148
Okay, slowly bring your
right arm around your back.

619
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:08,214
Now bring the other one.

620
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,632
-Remember me?
-Lawyer.

621
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,102
Easy. We're just getting started.

622
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,729
Lawyer, motherfucker.

623
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,172
Okay, so you're hard, but guess what?

624
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,073
-I could give a fuck.
-You?

625
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,701
I'm tired of your games.

626
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,543
What, you want me to write a letter,
or some shit like that?

627
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:40,880
No game we need to run.
You're popped with a kilo of uncut.

628
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,177
Not that you messed up.
You did everything right.

629
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,986
Speed limit, turn signals, working taillights.
Question you gotta ask is...

630
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,391
how'd those troopers know
to pull you over?

631
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:53,225
Someone else fucked up. You following me?

632
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:57,327
But it's you they're gonna blame,
and you who's gonna do the jolt.

633
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:01,028
-Lawyer.
-That'd be Levy, right?

634
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,507
He's getting paid by your uncle,
is that right?

635
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,441
Yeah, he's looking out for your interests.

636
00:44:08,547 --> 00:44:09,809
More than you.

637
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,011
Listen...

638
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:15,845
I ain't saying another damn thing...

639
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,354
to nobody but my lawyer.

640
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,789
By the way...

641
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:28,991
your boy Wallace,
shot dead in the low-rises.

642
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:32,268
That's how y'all take care
of your own, right?

643
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,398
You're a lying motherfucker.

644
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,035
So what?

645
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,736
You want me to write
a letter to his mom, too?

646
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,748
Get the fuck out of here.

647
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:01,088
You didn't have to send him
the way you did.

648
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,897
In one car?
He should've been trailing a mule.

649
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,767
95 or on the train,
it don't make no difference...

650
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,396
he shouldn't have been there alone.

651
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:12,601
-Look here, Brianna--
-Ain't you ever heard of a trap-car?

652
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,906
You send my son to New York...

653
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,106
in a motherfucking rental...

654
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,843
and you just let him ride
with that package in the trunk?

655
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,351
-I'm sorry--
-That won't bring him out of prison!

656
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:26,447
Better make sure that Jew lawyer of yours
earns his money, all right?

657
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,459
-D'Angelo gonna have to do his part.
-Meaning what?

658
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:32,121
You like the car you driving there, right?

659
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,766
You like this crib? I put you in this crib.
You like it?

660
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:38,568
Yeah, I mean, we all got a lot
to protect here.

661
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,001
You need to remind him of that.

662
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:42,938
So when it come down to it,
he can stand up tall.

663
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,680
You ain't gotta worry about my child.

664
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,713
I raised that boy, and I raised him right.

665
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:06,720
It wasn't me who fucked up.

666
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,796
Really? So who did?

667
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,360
Why the fuck are we here?

668
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,735
Listen, all you need to do
is keep your head through the bail hearing.

669
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,740
We got a good shot
at bringing you home here.

670
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:19,139
Then what?

671
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:24,847
Who gonna take the weight for all the shit
in the trunk of that car?

672
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,748
Where's Wallace at?

673
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,994
Where's the boy, String?

674
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,022
D'Angelo, shut your mouth.

675
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:48,099
Where's Wallace? That's all I want to know.

676
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,101
Kid, you better think.

677
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,435
Where the fuck is Wallace?

678
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:56,642
String!

679
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,816
Look at me!

680
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,817
Where the fuck is Wallace?

681
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,911
I don't want this Payless-wearing
motherfucker representing me.

682
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:05,887
I'm gonna get my own man, all right?

683
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,687
So just get back in your car,
and get the fuck back down south.

684
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:13,497
All right, you stupid motherfucker.
You made your decision.

685
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,759
Yeah, I made my decision.
Where's Wallace at?

686
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,028
Where the fuck is Wallace?
Where's Wallace, String?

687
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,233
String, where the fuck is Wallace?

688
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:24,172
Stringer!

689
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,606
Bring him in.

690
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,200
-You're done.
-Why?

691
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,737
We have the charge whenever we want it.

692
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:32,282
Why not stay up on the bug
we've got in his office?

693
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:34,817
The bug you didn't brief me about.

694
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,582
I thought your little bird
told you everything we did...

695
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,282
a minute after we did it.

696
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:43,258
One of our people got hurt.
That's supposed to mean something.

697
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,056
We're hunting her shooters...

698
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:47,825
and by the grace of God
and your good work...

699
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:50,895
we've got a viable case on our main target.

700
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:54,028
Just charge Barksdale
with the attempt purchase...

701
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:56,437
from New York and bring it all home.

702
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,236
What about Stringer, his number two?

703
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:00,743
He slipped off the hook
when we lost the boy witness.

704
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,710
We've done all we can.

705
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:04,672
Are you hearing me?

706
00:48:04,783 --> 00:48:07,911
These are the people responsible
for dropping a police.

707
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:11,019
Not just the shooters,
but the ones who make the dirt happen.

708
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:15,024
I'm trying to put them down for real,
not for some short-time bit.

709
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:17,587
That all you're trying to do?

710
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:21,025
If that's all you're doing,
how is it you have people...

711
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:23,726
pulling campaign records
and finance reports?

712
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:26,470
What the fuck has that
got to do with anything?

713
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,596
The money is part of my case.

714
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,236
There was a time
when I was willing to say otherwise...

715
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:35,540
to let you and all your friends
hide some of that dirt, but not now.

716
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,080
You want to talk about dirt? Have at it.

717
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,910
Talk some shit about
your Eastern district days.

718
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:44,785
Talk about what was going on back
when you was running wild in the DEU.

719
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:47,687
-That's just talk.
-Just talk?

720
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:57,797
FBI field reports.

721
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:02,235
You came into a lot of money, quick.

722
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:04,798
And you can go to jail just as quick...

723
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:08,436
if I start asking the right questions.

724
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,114
This case ends, or you are done.

725
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:14,413
Hell, I don't even need you
to lock up Barksdale.

726
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,717
I'll have your major debrief your detectives
and type the warrants himself.

727
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:21,656
This case is done!

728
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,431
You do what you feel.

729
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:31,168
You wanna pull Avon in on half a case?
You go ahead.

730
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:34,669
You wanna put my shit in the street?
Feel free.

731
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:38,731
But the Eastern had a lot of stories.
Mine ain't the only one.

732
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,334
A lot of people came through that district.

733
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,975
If you were gonna do me,
I'd already be done.

734
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:49,820
But there ain't nothing you fear more
than a bad headline now, is there?

735
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:53,652
You'd rather live in shit
than let the world see you work a shovel.

736
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:57,251
You can order warrants, and I'll serve them.

737
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,956
But as long as I have days
left on those dead wires...

738
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,055
this case goes on.

739
00:50:13,912 --> 00:50:16,813
Yo, look at these Delta Force
motherfuckers, man.

740
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:19,112
-Look at them.
-All right.

741
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:24,021
-What's up with Levy?
-He said he gonna meet us down there.

742
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,857
I still didn't get this safe
out of here yet, man.

743
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:28,425
How much money in it?

744
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,460
-$150,000.
-$150,000?

745
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,657
Open it up, man.
No sense in ruining a good safe.

746
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:56,345
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

747
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:58,649
The SWAT guys do love
to break out their toys.

748
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,383
They think it's Tony Montana up there?

749
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:03,051
They probably haven't
touched a gun in years.

750
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,162
Fuck this shit.

751
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:09,897
You and me, Lieutenant.

752
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,864
What units are in the alley?

753
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,200
Any sightline to the rear door?

754
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:22,780
10-4, who has the roof?

755
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:26,781
We're gonna move in on my command.
Everyone stand by.

756
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,052
We're not gonna need your men today.
Call them back.

757
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,988
-Now wait a minute--
-My case, back your men off.

758
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,082
Catch you later.

759
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,053
Good.

760
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,861
Barksdale's wearing bracelets.

761
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:00,201
Still no Wee-Bey, no Little Man?

762
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,066
No, nothing there.

763
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:16,420
This is the best work I ever did.
I never did a case like this.

764
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,684
But it's not enough.

765
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,954
I gotta go back to Auto tomorrow morning.

766
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,153
I just feel like this just ain't finished.

767
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:27,060
Detective.
