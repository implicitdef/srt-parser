1
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:47,893
From the year 1942
to the present time...

2
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:51,591
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

3
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,258
That's right.

4
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:58,237
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization?

5
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,207
We called it the Corleone family,
Senator. We called it the family.

6
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:07,713
What was your position?

7
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,717
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

8
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,256
- What is that?
- A button. You know, come on.

9
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,621
No, I don't know. Tell me.

10
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,491
When the boss says "push a button
on a guy," I push a button.

11
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,089
- See, Senator?
- Mr. Questadt.

12
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,102
- You mean you killed people?
- What?

13
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:34,164
You killed people
at the behest of your superiors?

14
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,307
Yeah, that's right, counselor.

15
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:45,046
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

16
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:48,213
Yeah, counselor, Michael Corleone,
right.

17
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:51,724
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

18
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:55,023
No, I never talked to him.

19
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,930
Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit, please?

20
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,763
Do what?

21
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:05,169
Could you expand on your answer?
I'm interested in knowing...

22
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:07,639
was there always a buffer involved?

23
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:11,637
Someone in between you
and your possible superiors...

24
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:15,182
- who gave the actual orders?
- Yeah, right, a buffer.

25
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:18,446
The family had a lot of buffers.

26
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,612
Mr. Cicci,
you may find this very amusing...

27
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,691
but I promise you the members
of this committee do not.

28
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:46,931
If there's something I could do
for you, you come, we talk.

29
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:16,261
The rent stays like before.

30
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:50,190
Hey, what do you think?
God bless America. Big business.

31
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,599
- New York City.
- Would you mind speaking up?

32
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,635
New York City.

33
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:05,934
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

34
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,067
- And where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

35
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:12,373
Did he, at times, use an alias...

36
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,881
that was known in certain circles
as "Godfather"?

37
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:19,776
"Godfather" is a term
that was used by his friends...

38
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:23,755
one of affection,
one of respect.

39
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:28,318
Mr. Chairman, I would like
to verify the witness's statement.

40
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,989
For years now, a growing number
of my constituents...

41
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,659
have been of ltalian descent...

42
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:35,736
and I've come to know them well.

43
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:41,002
They have honored me with their
support and with their friendship.

44
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:44,272
Indeed, I can proudly say
that some of my very best friends...

45
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,278
are ltalian-Americans.

46
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:52,412
However, Mr. Chairman, at this time,
I have to leave these proceedings...

47
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,389
to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

48
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:00,620
But before I leave,
I do want to say this--

49
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:05,256
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever...

50
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,630
a slur upon
the great Italian people...

51
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,966
because I can state from
my own knowledge and experience...

52
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:14,735
that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal...

53
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:17,140
most law-abiding, patriotic...

54
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:20,874
hard-working American citizens
in this land.

55
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:23,416
And it would be a shame,
Mr. Chairman...

56
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:25,679
if we allowed
a few rotten apples...

57
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:28,482
to give a bad name
to the whole barrel...

58
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:31,183
because from the time
of the great Christopher Columbus...

59
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:34,056
up to the time of Enrico Fermi...

60
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,153
right up until the present day...

61
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:38,164
Italian-Americans
have been pioneers...

62
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,461
in building and defending
our great nation.

63
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,798
They are the salt of the earth.

64
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:45,805
They are one of the backbones
of this country.

65
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:52,411
The chairman is calling
the meeting back to order.

66
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:56,142
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

67
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,186
Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been
advised as to your legal rights.

68
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:03,951
We have testimony from a witness,
a previous witness...

69
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:06,583
one Willi Cicci.

70
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,594
He has stated that you are head...

71
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:10,994
of the most powerful Mafia family
in this country.

72
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:13,999
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

73
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:17,593
The witness has testified that
you are personally responsible...

74
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:21,334
for the murder of a New York City
police captain in 1947.

75
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:25,173
And with him,
a man named Virgil Solozzo.

76
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,543
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.

77
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:30,913
Is it true that in the year 1950...

78
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:35,387
you devised a murder of the heads
of the so-called "five families"...

79
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,787
in New York, to assume
and consolidate...

80
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:40,292
your nefarious power?

81
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:44,228
- That's a complete falsehood.
- Is it true...

82
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:48,200
you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

83
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,099
No, it is not true. I own some stock
in some of the hotels there...

84
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,266
but very little.

85
00:16:57,445 --> 00:17:01,541
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

86
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:07,019
Do you have any interests or control
over gambling and narcotics...

87
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,588
in the state of New York?

88
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:10,623
No, I do not.

89
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,888
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement for this committee.

90
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:17,795
Mr. Chairman,
I think this statement...

91
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:20,093
is totally out of order
at this time.

92
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:24,001
Sir, my client has answered every
question asked by this committee...

93
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,868
with the utmost sincerity.

94
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,908
He did not take the Fifth Amendment,
as it was his right to do...

95
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,672
so in all fairness I think
the statement should be heard.

96
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:37,111
No, I'm going to allow Mr. Corleone
to read his statement.

97
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:38,617
I'll put it in the record.

98
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:43,749
"In the hopes of clearing
my family name...

99
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,418
and my sincere desire to give
my children their fair share...

100
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,586
of the American way of life
without a blemish...

101
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:51,028
on their name and background...

102
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:53,157
I have appeared
before this committee...

103
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:56,168
and given it all the cooperation
in my power.

104
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:00,507
I consider it a great dishonor
to me personally...

105
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:03,008
to have to deny
that I am a criminal.

106
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:07,607
I wish to have the following
noted for the record:

107
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:11,742
that I served my country faithfully
and honorably in World War Two...

108
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:16,255
and was awarded a Navy Cross for
actions in defense of my country...

109
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:22,228
that I have never been arrested or
indicted for any crime whatsoever...

110
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,391
that no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy...

111
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,128
whether it is called "Mafia,"
"Cosa Nostra"...

112
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:31,136
or whatever other name
you wish to give...

113
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:32,637
has ever been made public.

114
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:36,741
I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment...

115
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,903
although it is my right to do so.

116
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,940
I challenge this committee...

117
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:47,509
to produce any witness
or evidence against me.

118
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:50,055
And if they do not...

119
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:53,615
I hope they will have the decency
to clear my name...

120
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:57,027
with the same publicity with which
they now have besmirched it."

121
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:01,725
I'm sure we're allquite impressed,
Mr. Corleone...

122
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,304
particularly with your love
for our country.

123
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:07,101
Committee will stand in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday morning...

124
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,108
at which time the committee
will produce a witness...

125
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,940
who will corroborate the charges
which were made against you today...

126
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:15,038
and at which time, Mr. Corleone,
you may very well be subject...

127
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:17,208
to indictment for perjury.

128
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:19,445
I remind you that
you're still under subpoena.

129
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:21,453
Adjourned.

130
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,457
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

131
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:31,531
Ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth...

132
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:33,361
and I lose.

133
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,458
You sound like my bookie.

134
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:37,628
I owe that monkey my life.

135
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,465
Well, just get
a good night's sleep.

136
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,976
- Good night's sleep.
- Got a big day tomorrow.

137
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:48,014
Got you a new suit,
a new shirt, new tie.

138
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:52,017
I'm gonna shave you myself
in the morning.

139
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:56,912
You're gonna look respectable for
50 million of your fellow Americans.

140
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:03,262
My life won't be worth a nickel
after tomorrow.

141
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:06,765
Come on.
I saw this thing 19 times.

142
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:10,660
You got a great home here, Frankie.

143
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:14,730
The rest of your life, nobody gets
near you, you're not going anywhere.

144
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:18,073
That's great.
Beautiful.

145
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,147
Some deal I made.

146
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:23,011
You'll live like a king.
You'll be a hero.

147
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:26,177
You'll live better in here
than most people on the outside.

148
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:29,085
Some deal.
Jesus.

149
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:34,760
Alive.
Pentangeli is alive.

150
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,761
- How'd they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it.

151
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,970
Frankie went to make a deal
with the Rosato brothers...

152
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:47,165
and they tried to kill him.

153
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:49,174
He thought you double-crossed him.

154
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:53,075
Our people with the New York
detective said he was halfdead...

155
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,877
scared stiffand calling out loud
that you turned on him.

156
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:59,714
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one...

157
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,720
and a lot more.

158
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:05,920
The FBI has him airtight.

159
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,893
He's on an army base,
24-hour guards.

160
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:11,191
No way we can get to him.

161
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:14,267
You've opened yourself
to five counts of perjury.

162
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,405
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

163
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:22,203
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

164
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:27,045
Roth-- he played this one
beautifully.

165
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,089
I want to talk to Fredo.

166
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,730
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

167
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:23,759
We have time.

168
00:22:23,871 --> 00:22:26,772
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

169
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:30,342
I didn't know all that much.

170
00:22:31,612 --> 00:22:36,106
What about now? ls there anything
you can help me out with?

171
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,817
Anything you can tell me now?

172
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:43,555
They got Pentangeli,
that's all I can tell you.

173
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:01,999
I didn't know
it was gonna be a hit, Mike.

174
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:04,407
I swear to God,
I didn't know it was gonna be a hit.

175
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:11,851
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills...

176
00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:15,987
and he said
that he wanted to talk.

177
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:21,056
He said that you and Roth...

178
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:24,562
were in on a big deal together...

179
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:31,166
and that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

180
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:35,105
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations.

181
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:39,612
But if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

182
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:43,612
it'd be good for the family.

183
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:47,445
You believed that story?

184
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:49,920
You believed that?

185
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:53,687
He said there was something in it
for me... on my own.

186
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:56,422
I've always taken care of you.

187
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,430
Taken care of me?

188
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:03,299
You're my kid brother.
You take care of me?

189
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:08,535
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

190
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:12,043
Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that.

191
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,712
Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere.

192
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:20,719
Send Fredo to pick somebody up
at the airport.

193
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:24,120
I'm your older brother, Mike,
and I was stepped over!

194
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:28,991
- That's the way Pop wanted it.
- It ain't the way I wanted it!

195
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:31,587
I can handle things!
I'm smart!

196
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:35,658
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb. I'm smart...

197
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,828
and I want respect!

198
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:48,909
Is there anything you can tell me
about this investigation?

199
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:50,916
Anything more?

200
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:03,055
The Senate lawyer, Questadt...

201
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,721
he belongs to Roth.

202
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:20,905
You're nothing to me now.

203
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,545
You're not a brother,
you're not a friend.

204
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:30,386
I don't wanna know you
or what you do.

205
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:34,686
I don't wanna see you at the hotels.

206
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:37,195
I don't want you near my house.

207
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,200
When you see our mother,
I wanna know a day in advance...

208
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:43,769
so I won't be there.

209
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:48,436
You understand?

210
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:09,394
I don't want anything to happen
to him while my mother's alive.

211
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:02,942
There are more people
than a ball game in here.

212
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,950
There's Willi Cicci.

213
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:28,907
This committee will come to order.

214
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:34,574
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

215
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:38,378
- And where were you born?
- Partanego. Outside of Palermo.

216
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:40,715
Where do you live now?

217
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:45,224
I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.

218
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:51,491
We have here, finally, a witness
that will further testify...

219
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:54,294
to Michael Corleone's rule
over a criminal empire...

220
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:56,426
that controls all of the gambling
in this country...

221
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:57,935
and perhaps in other countries.

222
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:03,305
This witness had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

223
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,971
He can corroborate ourcharges on
enough counts for this committee...

224
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,449
to recommend a charge of perjury
against Michael Corleone.

225
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,246
- Senator.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

226
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:15,983
Mr. Pentangeli.

227
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:23,321
Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

228
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,992
Did you serve under
caporegime Peter Clemenza...

229
00:28:28,101 --> 00:28:32,765
under Vito Corleone,
also known as the "Godfather"?

230
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:41,239
I never knew no Godfather.

231
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:45,917
I have my own family, Senator.

232
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,156
Mr. Pentangeli, you are
contradicting a sworn statement...

233
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:56,161
you'd previously made to me
and signed.

234
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:59,824
I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...

235
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:04,461
were you at anytime
a memberof a crime organization...

236
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:05,970
headed by Michael Corleone?

237
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:09,770
I don't know nothing about that.

238
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:16,782
I was in the olive oil business
with his father...

239
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:19,283
but that was a long time ago,
that's all.

240
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,320
We have a sworn affidavit.

241
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:26,918
We have it--
your sworn affidavit...

242
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:29,518
that you murdered on
the orders of Michael Corleone.

243
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:31,790
Do you deny that confession?

244
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:34,662
And do you realize what will happen
as a result of your denial?

245
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:37,896
Look, the FBI guys,
they promised me a deal...

246
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:41,736
so I made up a lot of stuff
about Michael Corleone...

247
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:43,810
'cause that's what they wanted.

248
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,744
But it was all lies--
everything.

249
00:29:48,682 --> 00:29:51,048
And they kept saying...

250
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:53,312
Michael Corleone did this...

251
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,980
and that Michael Corleone did that.

252
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:01,520
So I said, "Yeah, sure!"

253
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:05,223
Mr. Corleone, would you kindly
identify for the committee...

254
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:07,232
the gentleman sitting
to your left?

255
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:09,234
I can answer that.

256
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:13,529
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

257
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,736
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

258
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:20,335
Will he come forward
and be sworn, sir?

259
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:23,143
Sir, this man
does not understand English.

260
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,879
He came at his own expense to aid
his brother in this time of trouble.

261
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:30,650
He's not under subpoena.
His reputation is impeccable.

262
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:32,622
Are you saying he knows nothing
about these matters?

263
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:34,125
To my knowledge, nothing.

264
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:37,196
I'm gonna find out
what the hell happened here.

265
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:39,288
Allright, this committee
is now adjourned.

266
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:41,594
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

267
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,803
This committee owes an apology!

268
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:50,809
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator.

269
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:22,301
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hold on a minute.

270
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:25,105
The children are outside.
We're going.

271
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:30,246
What do you mean you're going?
We're all gonna leave tomorrow.

272
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:36,755
I'll be in my room.

273
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,129
Michael, I'm not going
back to Nevada.

274
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,131
I brought the children
to say good-bye to you.

275
00:31:50,003 --> 00:31:52,130
I want you to know
I'm very happy for you.

276
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,764
I suppose I always knew
you were too smart...

277
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,809
to let any of them
ever beat you.

278
00:31:58,678 --> 00:32:03,138
- Why don't you sit down?
- I'm not going to stay long.

279
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,650
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

280
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,820
Some things that have been
on my mind.

281
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:15,187
- Changes I wanna make.
- I think it's too late for changes.

282
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:18,789
I promised myself
I wasn't going to say anything.

283
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:22,335
You're too late.

284
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,140
What really happened
with Pentangeli?

285
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,440
His brother came, helped him.

286
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:40,486
I didn't even know
he had a brother.

287
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:42,487
Where is he now?

288
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,124
He's on a plane back to Sicily.

289
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:49,327
All he had to do
was show his face.

290
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:55,826
It was between the brothers.
I had nothing to do with it.

291
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:09,107
Nobody is going--
not you, not the kids! You hear me?

292
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:12,913
You're my wife, they're my children.
I love you. I won't allow it.

293
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,888
You say you love me, then you
talk about allowing me to leave!

294
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:21,051
Things have been going on for years
between men and women...

295
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:23,061
- that will not change.
- You've become blind!

296
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:26,064
- Blind to what?
- Look what happened to us.

297
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,226
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened--

298
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:32,499
- Anthony is fine!
- Anthony is not fine!

299
00:33:32,606 --> 00:33:34,540
- I don't wanna hear about it!
- You will!

300
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:37,166
Anthony's not fine!

301
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:38,904
I don't wanna hear about it!

302
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:41,371
Over!

303
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:57,395
At this moment,
I feel no love for you at all.

304
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:01,465
I never thought
that would ever happen...

305
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:04,294
but it has.

306
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:25,117
We're gonna leave tomorrow.

307
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:29,161
Okay? Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

308
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:31,162
You haven't heard me.

309
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,463
What do you want from me?

310
00:34:35,568 --> 00:34:37,661
Do you expect me to let you go?

311
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:41,571
Do you expect me to let you take
my children from me?

312
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:45,702
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

313
00:34:45,812 --> 00:34:47,837
That that could never happen?

314
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:51,940
That I'd use all my power to keep
something like that from happening?

315
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:55,150
Don't you know that?

316
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,794
Now, in time...

317
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:06,365
you'll feel differently.

318
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,695
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

319
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:14,840
I know that.

320
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,911
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

321
00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:24,242
Yes.

322
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:26,751
I know what that meant to you.

323
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:32,257
I'll make it up to you.

324
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,259
I swear, I'll make it up to you.

325
00:35:36,463 --> 00:35:38,363
I'm gonna change.

326
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,328
I'll change.

327
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:43,902
I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

328
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:48,672
And you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

329
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,668
and we'll have another child...

330
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:54,576
and we'll go on--
you and I.

331
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:58,049
We'll go on.

332
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:03,780
You are blind.

333
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:07,892
It wasn't a miscarriage.

334
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:11,487
It was an abortion.

335
00:36:13,266 --> 00:36:15,166
An abortion.

336
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:18,537
Just like our marriage
is an abortion.

337
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:22,600
Something that's unholy and evil.

338
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:27,572
I didn't want your son!

339
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,049
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

340
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,888
It was an abortion!

341
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:38,822
It was a son! A son!
And I had it killed...

342
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:41,723
because this must all end!

343
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:47,390
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.

344
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:51,067
There would be no way...

345
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:54,140
no way you could ever forgive me...

346
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,606
not with this Sicilian thing...

347
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:58,939
that's been going on
for 2,000 years--

348
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:00,945
Bitch!

349
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:09,918
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

350
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:13,925
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

351
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:47,408
Fredo, here's this for Grandma.

352
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,258
What are you doing?

353
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:10,841
Michael, say good-bye.

354
00:45:28,354 --> 00:45:30,413
Can I speak with you
for a second?

355
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:43,292
- Where's Mike?
- Waiting foryou to leave.

356
00:45:46,906 --> 00:45:48,806
Can I talk with him?

357
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:50,808
Sorry, no chance.

358
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:54,678
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

359
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:10,227
Michael, it's Connie.

360
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:39,049
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

361
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:50,392
Is Kay coming?

362
00:47:02,982 --> 00:47:05,917
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

363
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:09,920
He asked for you,
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

364
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,226
That's right.

365
00:47:17,797 --> 00:47:21,198
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

366
00:47:25,504 --> 00:47:27,563
Please, I wanna talk to you.

367
00:47:39,452 --> 00:47:42,910
I hated you for so many years.

368
00:47:43,022 --> 00:47:47,049
I think that I did things to myself,
to hurt myself...

369
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,059
so that you'd know...

370
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:54,031
that I could hurt you.

371
00:48:00,439 --> 00:48:04,535
You were just being strong
for all of us the way Papa was.

372
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:07,378
And I forgive you.

373
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,719
Can't you forgive Fredo?

374
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:19,723
He's so sweet
and helpless without you.

375
00:48:25,898 --> 00:48:29,425
You need me.
I want to take care ofyou now.

376
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,249
Sit down.

377
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,793
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

378
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:44,863
You hear about it?

379
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,870
I hear that he's in Israel.

380
00:50:47,973 --> 00:50:50,373
And the High Court in Israel
turned down his request...

381
00:50:50,476 --> 00:50:52,671
to live there as a returned Jew.

382
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:56,737
His passport's been invalidated,
except for return to the US.

383
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:59,340
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

384
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:02,420
He offered a gift of a million
dollars if they let him live there.

385
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:06,256
They turned him down.

386
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,624
- He's gonna try Panama.
- Panama won't take him.

387
00:51:10,729 --> 00:51:13,220
Not for a million,
not for ten million.

388
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:15,232
His medical condition
is reported as terminal.

389
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:18,269
He's only gonna live
another six months anyway.

390
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,430
He's been dying of
the same heart attack for 20 years.

391
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,705
- That plane goes to Miami.
- Right. That's where I want it met.

392
00:51:26,812 --> 00:51:30,009
Mike, that's impossible.
They'll turn him over directly...

393
00:51:30,115 --> 00:51:32,310
to the lnternal Revenue, Customs
and half the FBl.

394
00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:35,649
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

395
00:51:35,754 --> 00:51:38,120
It would be like trying to kill
the president. No way to get to him.

396
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,358
You know, you surprise me.

397
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:48,226
If anything in this life
is certain--

398
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:50,598
if history's taught us anything...

399
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:54,131
it's that you can kill anyone.

400
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,506
Difficult, not impossible.

401
00:52:04,616 --> 00:52:06,880
Good.

402
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:12,352
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

403
00:52:15,961 --> 00:52:19,954
I thought you were
gonna tell me that...

404
00:52:20,065 --> 00:52:21,965
you were moving
your family to Vegas.

405
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:29,368
And that you'd been offered the
vice presidency of the hotels there.

406
00:52:29,475 --> 00:52:31,500
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- I turned them down.

407
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,339
Do I have to tell you
about every offer that I turn down?

408
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,676
Let's do business.

409
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:42,185
All right.

410
00:52:43,222 --> 00:52:45,281
Just consider this.
Just consider it.

411
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,020
Now, Roth and the Rosatos
are on the run.

412
00:52:49,128 --> 00:52:52,097
Are they worth it,
and are they strong enough?

413
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:56,031
Is it worth it?
I mean, you won.

414
00:52:56,135 --> 00:52:58,035
Do you want to wipe
everybody out?

415
00:52:58,137 --> 00:53:01,106
I don't feel I have to wipe
everybody out--

416
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:04,334
just my enemies, that's all.

417
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:13,278
You gonna come along with me on
these things I have to do or what?

418
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:20,215
'Cause if not, you can take your
wife, family and your mistress...

419
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:22,725
move them all to Las Vegas.

420
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:32,234
Why do you hurt me? I've always been
loyal to you. I mean, what is this?

421
00:53:45,984 --> 00:53:47,918
What is it that you want me to do?

422
00:53:51,256 --> 00:53:55,317
How would you like it if I taught
you how to catch really big fish?

423
00:53:55,427 --> 00:53:58,225
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

424
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,197
You know, when I was your age...

425
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,701
I went out fishing
with all my brothers...

426
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:07,203
and my father...

427
00:54:07,306 --> 00:54:09,331
everybody...

428
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:12,342
and I was the only one
that caught a fish.

429
00:54:13,812 --> 00:54:16,178
Nobody else could catch one,
except me.

430
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:18,181
You know how I did it?

431
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:23,313
Every time I put the line
in the water, I said a Hail Mary.

432
00:54:23,422 --> 00:54:26,323
And every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

433
00:54:29,695 --> 00:54:32,129
You believe that?
It's true.

434
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:34,131
That's the secret.

435
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:38,565
Wanna try it
when we go on the lake?

436
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,800
Okay.
What else you got?

437
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:11,959
Things are gonna be okay, Frankie.
Don't worry.

438
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:16,006
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah. Don't worry.

439
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:19,168
He's ten times tougher than me--
my brother.

440
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:22,111
He's old-fashioned.

441
00:55:22,214 --> 00:55:25,377
He didn't wanna go out to dinner.
He just wanted to go straight home.

442
00:55:25,484 --> 00:55:27,418
That's my brother.
There's nothing...

443
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:30,579
that could get him away
from that two-meal town.

444
00:55:30,689 --> 00:55:33,590
He could've been big here,
could've had his own family.

445
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:44,301
What do I do now?

446
00:55:52,444 --> 00:55:55,345
You were always interested
in politics and history.

447
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:01,351
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

448
00:56:01,453 --> 00:56:04,854
I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

449
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:10,159
You were around the old-timers...

450
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:13,459
agreeing about how the family's
should be organized...

451
00:56:13,565 --> 00:56:16,557
based on the old home allegiance
and called them regimes--

452
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:19,068
capos and soldiers.

453
00:56:20,238 --> 00:56:22,172
And it worked.

454
00:56:22,274 --> 00:56:24,799
Yeah, it worked.

455
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:28,539
Those were the great old days,
you know?

456
00:56:28,647 --> 00:56:31,707
And we was like the Roman Empire.

457
00:56:31,817 --> 00:56:35,218
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

458
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:41,658
It was once.

459
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:03,406
When a plot
against the emperor failed...

460
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:06,143
the plotters were always given
a chance...

461
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,320
to let the families
keep their fortunes.

462
00:57:12,424 --> 00:57:14,619
Yeah, but only the rich guys.

463
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:16,921
The little guys,
they got knocked off...

464
00:57:17,029 --> 00:57:19,759
and all their estates
went to the emperors...

465
00:57:19,865 --> 00:57:22,834
unless they went home
and killed themselves.

466
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:24,834
Then nothing happened to them.

467
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:30,206
And their families
were taken care of.

468
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:36,075
That was a good break.
Nice deal.

469
00:57:36,181 --> 00:57:37,580
Yeah.

470
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:40,584
They went home...

471
00:57:41,953 --> 00:57:45,081
and sat in a hot bath...

472
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,681
opened up their veins...

473
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:50,193
and bled to death.

474
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:54,664
And sometimes they had
a little party before they did it.

475
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:03,768
Don't worry about anything.

476
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,711
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

477
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,989
See you, Tom.

478
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:44,275
You have to go.

479
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,385
- So pretty.
- Please hurry. He's coming.

480
00:58:50,856 --> 00:58:53,757
Go rest.

481
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,898
Kiss Mama good-bye.

482
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:06,762
Will you kiss your mother good-bye?

483
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:08,772
Say good-bye to Mama.

484
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,142
I love you.

485
00:59:13,945 --> 00:59:15,344
Please.

486
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:35,890
Come here.

487
00:59:45,677 --> 00:59:47,736
Please, kiss me once.

488
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:29,606
Easy.

489
01:01:38,356 --> 01:01:41,120
He's here!
We're going fishing!

490
01:01:41,226 --> 01:01:43,888
Michael wants to take him
to Reno now!

491
01:01:43,995 --> 01:01:46,054
Oh, shit.

492
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:51,067
Okay, kid, you gotta go to Reno
with your pop.

493
01:01:52,604 --> 01:01:55,402
Come on, I'll take you
fishing tomorrow, okay?

494
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:56,906
Okay.

495
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,812
Attaboy.
Hey, Anthony.

496
01:02:01,913 --> 01:02:06,373
Listen. I'll catch one for you
in secret, huh? All right?

497
01:02:06,484 --> 01:02:08,384
Okay, go ahead.

498
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:10,379
Okay, let's go.

499
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:53,062
Mr. Roth, you understand
I'll have to take you into custody?

500
01:02:53,164 --> 01:02:55,064
Yes, I understand.

501
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:58,101
Can you give us your reaction to
the High Court of Israel's ruling?

502
01:02:58,203 --> 01:03:01,172
I'm a retired investor
on a pension.

503
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:04,639
I went to Israel because I wished
to live there as Jew...

504
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:06,301
in the twilight of my life.

505
01:03:12,717 --> 01:03:15,618
Hey, Frankie, come on out!
Let's play some hearts!

506
01:03:41,813 --> 01:03:44,646
Is it true you're worth
over $300 million, Mr. Roth?

507
01:03:44,749 --> 01:03:48,651
I'm a retired investor
living on a pension.

508
01:03:48,753 --> 01:03:52,450
I came home to vote
in the presidential election...

509
01:03:52,557 --> 01:03:55,720
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

510
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:10,707
Jesus Christ.

511
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:14,973
Hail Mary, full of grace...

512
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,810
the Lord is with thee.

513
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:21,215
Blessed are thou amongst women.

514
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:24,220
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

515
01:04:25,857 --> 01:04:29,588
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

516
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:15,335
Hey, everybody,
come on, pay attention. Come here.

517
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,568
This is my friend, Carlo Rizzi.
My brother, Fredo.

518
01:05:18,676 --> 01:05:20,405
- You know Fredo.
- Sure.

519
01:05:20,512 --> 01:05:25,245
Here's my stepbrother, Tom.
That's his girl, Theresa.

520
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:28,547
This cute little thing over here's
my sister Connie I told you about.

521
01:05:28,653 --> 01:05:31,451
Come on, say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, ain't he?

522
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:33,353
Yes.

523
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:36,052
Oh, that droopy thing over there,
that's my brother, Mike.

524
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:38,891
We call him Joe Collar, you know
what I mean? Go on, sit down.

525
01:05:38,997 --> 01:05:42,228
- Go ahead. Talk to each other.
- Sit down.

526
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:44,233
Hey, Mr. Einstein.

527
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:50,440
- Here's the cake.
- Hey, get in here.

528
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:56,012
- Where's your father?
- On a wild goose chase.

529
01:05:56,114 --> 01:05:58,514
- Here.
- Let's see that thing.

530
01:05:59,884 --> 01:06:02,546
- Oh, honey, that's nice.
- That's beautiful.

531
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:05,179
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Go on. You help her, all right?

532
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:06,689
Sure.

533
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:10,453
- What is that, rum?
- Yeah.

534
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:19,400
Sonny, come on, don't touch
the antipasto till Pop sees it.

535
01:06:27,412 --> 01:06:30,904
What do you think, the nerve of them
Japs, them slanty-eyed bastards?

536
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:33,313
Dropping bombs on our own backyard.
On Pop's birthday, you know?

537
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:36,854
They didn't know
it was Pop's birthday.

538
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,685
Well, we should've expected it
after the oil embargo.

539
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,419
What do you mean, expected it?
They got no right dropping bombs.

540
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:44,688
What are you, a Jap lover?
You on their side?

541
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:46,764
I understand 30,000 men enlisted
this morning.

542
01:06:46,864 --> 01:06:49,526
- Bunch of saps.
- Why are they saps?

543
01:06:49,634 --> 01:06:52,000
Come on, do we even have to talk
about the war?

544
01:06:52,103 --> 01:06:53,866
You talk to Carlo, all right?

545
01:06:56,174 --> 01:07:00,201
They're saps because
they risk their lives for strangers.

546
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:04,111
- That's Pop talking.
- You're goddamn right.

547
01:07:04,215 --> 01:07:05,739
They risk their lives
for their country.

548
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:07,545
Country ain't your blood.
You remember that.

549
01:07:07,652 --> 01:07:09,882
- I don't feel that way.
- "I don't feel that way."

550
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:13,446
If you don't feel like that,
quit college and join the army.

551
01:07:13,558 --> 01:07:15,025
I did.

552
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,889
I enlisted in the Marines.

553
01:07:21,566 --> 01:07:24,797
- Mike, why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

554
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:28,065
Pop had to pull a lot of strings
to get you a deferment.

555
01:07:28,172 --> 01:07:29,230
I didn't ask for it.

556
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,467
I didn't ask for a deferment.
I didn't want it.

557
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:35,702
Come on, knock it off! Come on!

558
01:07:35,813 --> 01:07:37,804
Punk.

559
01:07:37,915 --> 01:07:39,576
- Go on.
- Sit down.

560
01:07:42,453 --> 01:07:45,650
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

561
01:07:49,427 --> 01:07:51,327
Go show Carlo the tree.

562
01:08:02,006 --> 01:08:03,405
Nice.

563
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:10,880
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

564
01:08:11,649 --> 01:08:14,345
That's swell. Congratulations.

565
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:18,115
That's right, encourage him.
Go on, get me a drink.

566
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:21,151
Go on.

567
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:26,822
I don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

568
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:31,095
Many times, he and I have talked
about your future.

569
01:08:33,004 --> 01:08:34,767
You talked to my father
about my future?

570
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:42,012
- My future?
- He has high hopes for you.

571
01:08:42,113 --> 01:08:44,240
I have my own plans
for my future.

572
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,845
Did you go to college to get stupid?
You're really stupid.

573
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,852
He's here, come on!

574
01:08:52,156 --> 01:08:54,386
Come on.

575
01:08:56,294 --> 01:08:57,693
Stupid.

576
01:09:14,712 --> 01:09:18,375
Surprise!

577
01:09:18,483 --> 01:09:22,749
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

578
01:09:22,854 --> 01:09:26,415
For he's a jolly good fellow

579
01:09:26,524 --> 01:09:28,617
Which nobody can deny
