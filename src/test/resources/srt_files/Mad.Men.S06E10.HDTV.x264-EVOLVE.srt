<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:04,548
Heaven's a little morbid.

3
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:05,679
I didn't get to Heaven.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,233
Something terrible
has to happen.

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,783
I'm sorry my accomplishments
happen in broad daylight

6
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,930
and I can't be given
the same rewards.

7
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:13,950
I'm sorry, but your
name escapes me.

8
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,918
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm upstairs, in Accounts.

9
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,997
You know,
but just in the outfield.

10
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:20,304
What did they say?

11
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,502
It's just like last time, no.

12
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:24,435
We cannot go on like this.

13
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:26,653
This is what Chevy
is paying us for.

14
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,330
It's not our clock,
it's theirs.

15
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,828
So what's another weekend?

16
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,742

This convention instructs the
Democratic National Committee

19
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:14,007
that it shall
include in the call

00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:30,423
What?

25
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,160
( sighs )

26
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,228
They're supposed
to be debating the war.

27
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,965
They can debate it all they want,
they just can't come out against it.

28
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,133
Then no one will vote
for Humphrey.

29
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,402
Over Nixon?

30
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,806
Well, they can't have the whole
convention without talking about the war.

31
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,242
30 seconds after prime time,
they'll start the debate.

32
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,410
<i>( TV off )</i>

33
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,512
Cops have been hassling
protesters all day.

34
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:58,116
Also not in prime time.

35
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,517
You're so cynical.

36
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,952
Come over here.

37
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:08,525
Come with me.

38
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,094
We'll go back to Disneyland.

39
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:12,329
From what I remember, something
amazing happened there.

40
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:15,632
- I made the biggest mistake of my life.
- That's true.

41
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:20,036
You know I'd come if I could.

42
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,871
You'll have fun.

43
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,474
Just stay away from actresses.

44
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:26,442
Do they have them out there?

45
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:28,644
I hate actresses.

46
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:30,613
( chuckles )

47
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,784
Kenny said that this time
he went to a floor

48
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,352
in the Chevy building
he'd never been to before.

49
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:39,054
He said it was
like "Get Smart."

50
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:40,922
Just a bunch of doors
in procession.

51
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:43,825
And he met the man he believes to be
the source of our current torture.

52
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,528
- What's his name? - Same as the
rest of them-- Jack something.

53
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:48,730
Apparently
his feelings were hurt

54
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,399
because we haven't
kissed his ring.

55
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,599
Well, I'd be happy to go
there and help soften him up.

56
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,868
- If anyone's going, I'm going.
- But you can't

57
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:57,138
because you're going to Los Angeles for--
what again?

58
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,573
I'm going to pay them
a visit immediately.

59
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:02,009
We don't want to miss our flight.
Are we going?

60
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:03,544
Right after
the partners' meeting.

61
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:05,712
Oh.

62
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,683
Are we done here?

63
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:13,253
Sweetheart, could you step out?

64
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,723
This morning I received
an envelope addressed to

65
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:19,825
Sterling Gleason and Pryce.

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,095
- From who?
- It doesn't matter.

67
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:24,863
They don't know our name because
we don't know our name.

68
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:27,132
Aren't we SCDPCGC?

69
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,567
Not officially.

70
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,635
Well, I'm tired
of the conversation

71
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,404
that goes along
with my business card.

72
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,441
I know that no one has observed the
memo that requested specifically

73
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:37,742
that all seven letters be used
when answering the phone.

74
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:41,613
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce Cutler
Gleason and Chaough? It's a mouthful.

75
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:44,382
SCDPCGC <i>is</i> a mouthful.

76
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,686
But CGCSCDP is <i>not.</i>

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,354
- I don't agree.
- We've each lost a partner.

78
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,057
Why don't we each
lose a letter?

79
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,858
SCDC.

80
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:56,527
- What do the Cs stand for?
- Not Campbell.

81
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:57,895
Cooper and Cutler.

82
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,396
Pardon me?

83
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, SCDCC sounds like a
stutter and looks like a typo.

84
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:06,336
Very well, if it puts
this to rest,

85
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,338
I will gladly withdraw my name

86
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:12,109
along with the other deceased
parties in this conversation.

87
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:13,943
Bert, don't be a martyr.

88
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:16,345
Want to throw away
both of these brands?

89
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,447
Just leave it alone. We'll
get a bigger front door.

90
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,883
Well, of course you like it.
You're at the front.

91
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,819
- I'm at the end.
- <i>I'm</i> at the end.

92
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:24,520
Well, I move to table this.

93
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,089
You have fun in Detroit.

94
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:27,724
And you have fun
with Manischewitz.

95
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:29,091
Any special instructions?

96
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,527
Yeah, the guy in charge, just
pick an eye and stick with it.

97
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,997
Very well, but it's my belief
that any further delay

98
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:37,132
in choosing our name
will take it out of our hands

99
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,334
and leave it up to the world.

100
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:51,445
You know Sunkist is still
only doing print work?

101
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,181
I'm cutting you off.

102
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:57,217
- You're two ahead of me.
- No, from work.

103
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,453
Come on.
We're executives.

104
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,154
Leave the drudgery
to Ted Chaough

105
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:02,488
and the rest of the underlings.

106
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:03,723
Did you prepare at all?

107
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:07,193
Sunkist, Carnation,
the avocado people.

108
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:09,129
My biggest job
in these meetings

109
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:11,865
is to keep them from saying
"golly" too many times.

110
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:14,233
Carnation has 27 million
in billings.

111
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:16,702
I don't think the guy in charge
ties his pants with a rope.

112
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:19,337
I didn't say that. But I guarantee
they all have a certain regard

113
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,873
for two gentlemen
from the big city.

114
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,274
You mean they won't trust us?

115
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:24,176
I mean they don't
trust themselves.

116
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,577
I don't know if you realize it,

117
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:27,612
but we are big New York admen

118
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,982
from an agency with seven
letters in its name.

119
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:32,051
That means under
no circumstances

120
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:35,687
are you to trot out that drawl
you do when you've had too many.

121
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:39,023
Be slick. Be glib.
Be <i>you.</i>

122
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:41,759
Well, I'm usually informed.

123
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:43,795
We're conquistadors.

124
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,430
I'm Vasco da Gama and
you're some other Mexican.

125
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:49,332
We're gonna land there, buy whatever
they've got for the beads in our pockets.

126
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:52,803
Our biggest challenge
is to not get syphilis.

127
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:54,871
Cathy.

128
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,673
Another round.

129
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,809
And send one to the pilot.

130
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,613
( sighs )

131
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,316
Man on radio:
<i>...hours of acrimonious debate,</i>

00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,721

<i>of North Vietnam.</i>

136
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,494
What's going on?

137
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,996
They delayed till noon
and then they rejected it.

138
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,199
- Rejected what?
- The peace plank.

139
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,701
Chance to have a platform
against the war.

140
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:29,604
Uh-huh. Then let me
clarify my question.

141
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,639
What's going on with
the work for Manischewitz?

142
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:33,441
Because you're for the war.

143
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,877
You know there's 200
body bags every week.

144
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,611
Figure out how to get
into that business yet?

145
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:39,880
( chuckles )
I refuse to be distracted

146
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:42,816
by events in which I have no
actual stake or participation.

147
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:44,351
How could you say that?

148
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:45,719
Because he doesn't
have any sons.

149
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:48,055
I served in the Air Force.
Did you?

150
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:50,457
You're disgusting,
you know that?

151
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:53,459
This whole thing works because
people like you look the other way.

152
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:56,028
- Ginsberg.
- My politics are private.

153
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:57,563
But that presentation isn't.

154
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,999
Now, are you gonna hide your
dawdling behind your outrage?

155
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,768
You'll have your work
and you know it.

156
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:04,771
You can go in there and take
credit for it like you always do.

157
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:08,374
Be friendly and charming after you've
stuck your fascist boot on my neck.

158
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,708
So I'm a fascist because
I gave you a deadline?

159
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,044
No, you're a fascist
because you love business

160
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,214
and you hate everything
else-- freedom, blacks, Jews.

161
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:17,849
This is my stop.

162
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,450
I hate hypocrites.

163
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,821
Like hippies who cash checks from
Dow Chemical and General Motors.

164
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:25,756
You rooting for the Soviets
in Prague, too, you Nazi?

165
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,458
Michael, what are you doing?
That man is your boss.

166
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,561
Why are you always down here?
Go back upstairs!

167
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,698
You're a truncheon, Cutler.

168
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:38,836
Thanks for making that worse.

169
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,875
Hello, Ted.

170
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,877
- You busy?
- Extremely.

171
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:51,347
I think you know
I'm a man without regrets,

172
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,749
but I do believe
we fired the wrong people

173
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:55,985
and I'd like to remedy
that immediately.

174
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,954
Jim, I think you're upset.

175
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:01,023
No, because I have a solution.

176
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,958
I think we should remove
the rest of their people

177
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:05,560
while Sterling, Draper,
and Crane are in California.

178
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:09,064
Just lock the gates and leave
Pete Campbell as the doorman.

179
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,566
- What happened?
- Do I need cause?

180
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,535
How about failure
to complete tasks

181
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,136
coupled with gross
insubordination?

182
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,572
Maybe part of it is you
keep seeing this agency

183
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,341
as our people and their people.

184
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,009
Well, how about your people
and my people?

185
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,178
Do I have permission
to clean out creative,

186
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,747
starting with
Mr. Ginsberg?

187
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:27,515
Jim, he's lightning
in a bottle.

188
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,250
You have to start holding
hands, starting with his.

189
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,918
Because I'll be in
Detroit tomorrow

190
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:33,487
and you're taking him
to Manischewitz.

191
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:36,156
Sterling's client
and Draper's boy.

192
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,228
I'm the world's
most expensive babysitter.

193
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:42,496
That's the spirit.

194
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,835
I suppose I wouldn't be a
good friend if I didn't ask--

195
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,403
is Kate pulling
her weight around there?

196
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,739
She arranged this.

197
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:54,707
She did.

198
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,645
Well, Kate told me that
you're the kind of woman

199
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,781
who won't just tell me
what I want to hear.

200
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:03,782
I hope she didn't make
any promises.

201
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,319
My wife always says
I'm the kind of man

202
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,721
who doesn't like
to ask for directions.

203
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,224
My new job has me
face-to-face with ad agencies.

204
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,558
I don't know what I'm doing.

205
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:16,695
Kate said you were divorced.

206
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,663
I am.

207
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,232
I forgot.

208
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:23,734
( laughs ) What does that say?

209
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,569
( sighs )

210
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:28,072
Anyway, what should
I look for in an agency?

211
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:32,911
Oh, well, a good agency
should tell you.

212
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,644
Go ahead.

213
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:36,179
Me?
( laughs )

214
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:37,647
That's why I'm here.

215
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:44,121
Yes.

216
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:46,256
Of course.

217
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:51,327
Well, I suppose we don't
just lean on

218
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:53,462
stylish creative,
or market research.

219
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,531
We listen to the client.

220
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,599
Doesn't everybody do that?

221
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,369
Despite your modesty,
you already know

222
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,571
that the way to get invited
into people's homes

223
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,140
is through their TV sets.

224
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:08,076
Media placement is part
science, part courage.

225
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,012
Anyone can tell you not to run
makeup ads during football.

226
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:14,082
The trick is finding
your customers

227
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:15,850
in places you hadn't
thought to look.

228
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:18,320
Harry Crane is a wizard.

229
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:21,323
They use a computer
the size of this restaurant.

230
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:23,057
And what is your job there?

231
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,027
I'm in charge
of thinking of things

232
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,862
before people
know they need them.

233
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,770
- I've got this.
- Come on.

234
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,673
Please, this is what
I get paid to do.

235
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,852
I was just coming to see you.

236
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,588
But you're not going anywhere.

237
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,291
I was, but then you appeared.

238
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,326
At the risk of playing defense,

239
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,863
I only interfered
because I hate disrespect.

240
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,966
I don't know
what you're talking about.

241
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,336
- Neither do I.
- Hmm.

242
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,272
I believe in you, Bob.
But you're untested.

243
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,574
Manischewitz,
tomorrow afternoon--

244
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,309
think you can handle
the parties involved?

245
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:22,678
Michael Ginsberg
or the clients?

246
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:24,680
I don't see much
difference, do you?

247
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:27,783
I think I can
keep the volume down.

248
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,752
Excellent.

249
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:32,022
I welcome this chance to shine.

250
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:49,471
( film flapping )

251
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:52,573
- Are you on a deadline?
- No, do you need me?

252
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,008
I need a drink.

253
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,609
Okay.

254
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:57,645
I had this lunch
my friend Kate set up

255
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,048
and I think
it's a potential client.

256
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,949
- I know he is.
- Who is he?

257
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:03,918
The new head
of marketing at Avon.

258
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:05,819
( laughs )

259
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:08,055
I thought it was a date, but
it turned out to be better.

260
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,990
- I love Avon.
- Of course.

261
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,659
And you'd be perfect for it.

262
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:14,494
It's just-- I don't know
what to do with it.

263
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,329
He's leaving town tomorrow.

264
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:18,098
So set a meeting.

265
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:19,900
I know I have to,
but Don's not here

266
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:21,669
and I don't want to get
kicked off the diving board.

267
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,870
We'll take it to Ted.

268
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:26,238
- He'll know what to do.
- What did I just say?

269
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:27,907
He's not like that.

270
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:30,610
And what do I ask for?

271
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:32,278
I don't know.

272
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,781
You'll be the account man
if that's what you want.

273
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,217
Trust me,
he loves new business.

274
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,919
He doesn't care where it comes from.
Let's go.

275
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,159
- I told you I wanted a rental car.
- They insisted.

276
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,295
- Ted, do you have a minute?
- Just barely.

277
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:53,131
Well, it's kind of urgent.
Joan has a solid lead.

278
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:54,899
He's leaving tomorrow.
We need to set a meeting.

279
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,934
Good for you. Get Pete
Campbell down here.

280
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:59,870
- Who is it?
- It's Avon Cosmetics.

281
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,706
<i>- It's Moira. Can you send him down</i>
<i>immediately?</i> - Very groovy.

282
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,009
The new head of marketing, he's a
friend of a very close friend of mine

283
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:06,677
and I just wanted
to introduce him to Peggy.

284
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,846
- Peggy'd be perfect for it.
- You rang?

285
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,247
Pete, as head
of new business--

286
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:11,982
Since when?
I don't want that.

287
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,717
Joan has a lead
for Avon Cosmetics.

288
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,519
Peggy's creative. He's leaving
town tomorrow. Reel him in.

289
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:19,489
Moira:
<i>Fly safe.</i>

290
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:21,290
Avon Cosmetics.

291
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,493
That's Fortune 500.
What's his name?

292
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:25,495
Andy Hayes.

293
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,064
My friend Kate just moved there from
Mary Kay and she sent him my way.

294
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,334
Tell me everything you can about him and
set lunch tomorrow for Peggy and me.

295
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,269
I should be there.

296
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:36,739
Joan, this is how
things get botched.

297
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,573
First, account man
and creative.

298
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,342
Then if all goes well,
next trip

299
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:42,577
he visits the office
and you show him around.

300
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:45,046
I think he'll be expecting me.

301
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,748
Shouldn't Joan
make the introductions?

302
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,582
I don't understand
what the problem is.

303
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,618
You're going to make the call

304
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:53,487
and tell him how important I
am and how exciting Peggy is.

305
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:56,157
And then we're going to tell
him how essential you are.

306
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,926
Don't worry.
You'll get all the credit.

307
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:03,664
Clara.
Are you coming?

308
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:39,898
Hey, I let you sit up front.

309
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,433
Sorry about that.
You need a hand?

310
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,802
What?

311
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:48,939
There's no one
from GM in Los Angeles?

312
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,507
Get rid of that car.

313
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,109
And get us something
with a roof.

314
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,511
Don't want to show up to a
meeting with bugs in my teeth.

315
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,646
So, you want to take
a dip in the pool

316
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,281
or should I
just wait in the bar?

317
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,483
- Both have attractive scenery.
- Where's the bellman?

318
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,186
Mañana, Don.
Everything's mañana here.

319
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,922
I'm gonna take a shower. You can
wait in the bar if you want.

320
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:07,724
I'm gonna get room service.

321
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,258
We're gonna go
to the Sunset Strip,

322
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,760
watch a girl dance in a cage.

323
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,261
That you heard?

324
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:13,529
Save your strength
for tomorrow.

325
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,631
Going to a party in the hills.

326
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,466
- It's very hip.
- Beverly Hills?

327
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,468
No, <i>the</i> hills. And
it's movies, not TV.

328
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,504
My friend in development at CBS says
it's going to be crawling with moguls.

329
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,373
- Jesus, it's hot here.
- It's a dry heat.

330
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,209
It's a dry heave.

331
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,510
Come on, Don, let's go to the Strip
right now and get some dinner.

332
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,079
No, I'm gonna turn in.

333
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:33,882
Tried to sleep on the plane, but
somebody wouldn't stop talking.

334
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:39,419
Don't worry, I got this.

335
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,761
TV anchor: <i>This is on tape since again
we're not able to cover it live.</i>

336
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:46,462
The tape you're about
to see was made

337
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:49,164
about 30 to 40 minutes ago.

338
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,333
( people shouting )

339
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,436
( horns honking )

340
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,094
( people screaming )

341
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:37,275
<i>It was supposed to be a
nonviolent demonstration today.</i>

342
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,948
<i>And one will never know</i>
<i>what it was</i>

343
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:45,183
<i>that made it become violent.</i>

344
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,621
( phone ringing ) <i>This is directly
in front of what advertises itself</i>

345
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:52,022
<i>as the world's largest</i>
<i>and friendliest hotel.</i>

346
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:54,692
<i>Where at this hour</i>
<i>people stand around</i>

347
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,226
<i>and sit in their rooms</i>
<i>with handkerchiefs...</i>

348
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:59,196
- Hello.
- Are you watching this?

349
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,499
Yeah.

350
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,167
It's hard to believe
no one got killed.

351
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:06,170
That the only measure?

352
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:08,605
Can you imagine a policeman
cracking your skull?

353
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:10,207
It would change
your whole life.

354
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,209
Honey, they're throwing rocks.

355
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,810
They're prepared for trouble.

356
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,285
Reporter: <i>In some
places, plainclothesmen</i>

357
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,853
<i>are helping make the arrests.</i>

358
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:30,226
On the bright side, Conrad Hilton is
probably in that hotel right now.

359
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,161
Don't make jokes.

360
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:34,063
Megan, you can't even vote.

361
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,133
But I live here.

362
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,636
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:48,811
I want you to be careful.

364
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:50,479
This could easily start a riot.

365
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:52,781
Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

366
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:54,750
Really?

367
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,985
You can if you want to.

368
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,587
I miss you.

369
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,391
Go for a swim.

370
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:05,359
It always makes you
feel better.

371
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:08,496
<i>( people chanting )</i>
<i>The whole world is watching.</i>

372
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,601
The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching.

373
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,737
Reporter: <i>There's a break
in the arrests now...</i>

374
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,439
We should hang up.
This is costing a fortune.

375
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,575
Try and get some sleep.

376
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:23,644
You, too.

377
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:26,112
Bye.

378
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,981
( chuckles )

379
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:30,182
Bye.

380
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:42,562
( sighs )

381
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,836
So you came after all.

382
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,738
Pete couldn't make it.

383
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:56,608
What? How the hell are
we supposed to do this?

384
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,877
Don't worry about it.
Coffee, please.

385
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:02,880
I didn't know Ted was going
to handle it that way.

386
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:04,848
Well, he did.

387
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:08,686
And Pete's not coming...

388
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,054
because he wasn't invited.

389
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,625
- You can't do that.
- I did it.

390
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,460
If you want to leave, go ahead.

391
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:19,929
I hope I didn't keep you waiting,
but I was trying to check out.

392
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:22,098
See, if you were a client,
you could have left your key

393
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:24,667
at the desk and we would
have attended to that.

394
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:26,703
Andy Hayes, Peggy Olson.

395
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,671
She's the dynamite
in our creative department.

396
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:30,139
I don't know about that.

397
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,808
Tomato juice
and coffee, please.

398
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,978
I didn't want you to leave New
York without meeting Peggy.

399
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:39,081
Her expertise has been honed
by her work on Clearasil,

400
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:42,150
Pond's Cold Cream, and most
relevant, Belle Jolie lipsticks.

401
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:43,885
I almost worked there.

402
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,420
Do you remember
"Mark your man"?

403
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:47,022
I do.

404
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,356
I grew up in an Avon home.

405
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,959
Our lady was Gladys Bowman.

406
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:53,694
She was very elegant.

407
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:57,031
My mother would vacuum
the drapes before she came.

408
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,500
Then my sister and I would
fight over the catalogue.

409
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:02,202
- In fact--
- In fact, all women

410
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:05,238
have some kind of personal
connection to Avon.

411
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,674
But that doesn't turn into
advertising, now, does it?

412
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,510
Why don't you tell us
your biggest challenge?

413
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,980
We're here to listen. It's just
hard to hide our enthusiasm.

414
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:16,215
It's true.

415
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,118
Well, they don't
bring in a new guy

416
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:21,053
unless they're expanding
or sales are flat.

417
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,689
I'm afraid it's the latter.

418
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,324
Women are working.
They're not home.

419
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,161
And hippies don't wear
makeup at all.

420
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,363
I'm not sure if we should
try to be "groovier"

421
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,398
or nostalgic.

422
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,600
We're somewhere
in between right now.

423
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,871
That's about it.

424
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,474
Peggy?

425
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,677
Yes, Joan?

426
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,549
What do you think
of your current work?

427
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,249
Besides the fact
that it's not working?

428
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,220
It's okay.
We didn't do it.

429
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:59,222
I don't know how
to describe it.

430
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:02,092
Would you say it's
unintentionally old-fashioned?

431
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:04,027
Yes.

432
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,395
Yes, I would.

433
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,498
I'm sure you've thought
of this already,

434
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:11,100
but Joan and I were saying
how convenient it would be

435
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:14,403
to have the Avon lady come to
the office maybe during lunch.

436
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:17,807
Well, they're not resistant to
trying that, just to advertising it.

437
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:20,109
There's no doorbell
in an office.

438
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:27,749
I only saw a little bit
of it on the morning news,

439
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:31,086
but I'm sorry I missed
Humphrey's acceptance speech.

440
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,821
I assume he was
high-voiced and desperate.

441
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:35,556
You're the exception. Early numbers
look like over 80 million people.

442
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:38,093
Look, we all hated what we saw,

443
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:40,861
but the Democrats are dead.
It's over.

444
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,897
Not just now, maybe forever.

445
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:46,133
- ( laughs )
- <i>( door opens )</i>

446
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,168
As you were.
Nobody get up.

447
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,170
Nonsense, Jack.
Great to see you finally.

448
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,005
Roger Sterling, Don Draper.

449
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:57,409
George was just laughing that these
riots gave Nixon the election.

450
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,013
I don't think that's
anything to smile about.

451
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:04,316
And although this boardroom
has been the site

452
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:06,753
of many casual
political conversations

453
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:08,587
among better men than us,

454
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:10,223
this is a business meeting.

455
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:12,424
You're right, Jack.

456
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,460
Last night was disgusting,

457
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:19,965
seeing those long-haired
fools <i>shame</i> this country.

458
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:23,068
You think Richard Nixon
is going to fix that?

459
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:25,603
I think he's a patriot.

460
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:27,538
Dutch Reagan is a patriot.

461
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:29,406
Nixon is an opportunist.

462
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,979
Now why don't you gentlemen
tell us how it's possible

463
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:37,047
to devote your energies
to our nutritious

464
00:22:37,082 --> 00:22:39,049
and delicious Instant Breakfast

465
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:41,385
and Life Cereal
at the same time?

466
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:45,088
Well, Jack,

467
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:48,224
your powdered milk
and dairy products

468
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,828
have had a long, successful
relationship with breakfast cereal.

469
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,596
There's no reason
to give that up.

470
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,531
And as far as we can tell,

471
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:58,367
Instant Breakfast has
a different target-- adults.

472
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,069
They don't eat cereal.

473
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:03,205
They eat bacon and eggs.

474
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,340
And this is healthier,

475
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,310
easier, and instant.

476
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:11,746
And what if we were to say we
find the conflict unresolvable?

477
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:14,283
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we
discussed this over the phone.

478
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:17,952
This is about a whole different level
of exposure for your products.

479
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:20,321
All of them. You should
be in game shows.

480
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,889
You should have a presence
on Saturday morning.

481
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:24,358
Where we'll sit right next
to one of your cereal ads?

482
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:28,930
- Don?
- Look, Jack, George,

483
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:32,966
I'm sure you know that we would
do anything to make this work.

484
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,135
We believe that strongly
in Carnation.

485
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:36,703
We believe in the wholesomeness

486
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:40,540
of both your intentions
and your products.

487
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:42,475
To be frank,

488
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,111
we've worked with
New York firms before.

489
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:47,547
We come in in the
morning, try to get you,

490
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,181
everyone's at lunch.

491
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,250
And when people
are at lunch around here,

492
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:53,986
that's just the time
we get a message from you.

493
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,621
And with it comes an attitude

494
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:59,158
as if to say we're not
working hard out here.

495
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:02,394
I can assure you, it is
very much to the contrary.

496
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:05,663
Look, we're sorry your
last girlfriend hurt you.

497
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,566
We're in your office right now.

498
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:13,404
Tell us what you have in mind.

499
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:24,245
What is going on? I just handed
you the business of your life.

500
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,414
What is going on?
You just threw it away.

501
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:28,549
Morning, ladies.

502
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:30,884
- Morning.
- Morning.

503
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,886
Stop that.

504
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,623
What exactly
are you planning to do?

505
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,658
Are you trying
to intimidate me?

506
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:40,494
No, that's always
been impossible

507
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:42,562
because that would require
respect for me or what I do.

508
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:46,399
I know you want this,
and now you can't have it.

509
00:24:46,434 --> 00:24:48,268
You could've,
but now you can't.

510
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:51,171
It's mine. And I've
been doing account work

511
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:53,273
in one form or another
since the day I started.

512
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:54,840
But you're not in
that department.

513
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:56,408
I never said that to you

514
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:58,043
when you stopped filing
and started writing copy.

515
00:24:58,077 --> 00:24:59,545
Yes, you did.
Every day.

516
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:01,013
And it was worse
because you made me feel

517
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:03,182
like I couldn't do it.

518
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:05,017
I know you can do this.

519
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,785
So why do you think
I should give it away?

520
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:08,521
I worked my way up.

521
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:10,555
You were so brave,

522
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,690
letting Don carry you
to the deep end of the pool.

523
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:14,325
I never slept with him.

524
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:21,366
Congratulations. You
really are just like them.

525
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,469
I'm sorry, but I never thought I
would be in the position to say,

526
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:26,003
"Joan, you've made
a mistake."

527
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,405
I have to do it myself, Peggy.

528
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,907
This is the only way
I could do it.

529
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:34,711
Because all that matters now is who
has a relationship with that client.

530
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:35,945
Who is the client
going to call?

531
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,714
Well, I am sick to my stomach

532
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:40,050
thinking about what you're going
to say when they find out.

533
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:41,451
I'll be fine.

534
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,657
Man on record:
<i>Gentlemen, after all,</i>

535
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:51,360
<i>this business of selling</i>
<i>narrows down to one thing.</i>

536
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:54,497
<i>Just one thing.</i>
<i>Seeing the people.</i>

537
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:57,633
( phone rings ) <i>Show me any
man of ordinary ability</i>

538
00:25:57,668 --> 00:25:59,501
<i>who will go out</i>
<i>and earnestly tell...</i>

539
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:01,869
Benson here.

540
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,276
( doorknob rattling )

541
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:12,046
- Ginzo, you have a visitor.
- Where is he?

542
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,817
Michael?

543
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,086
- What's wrong?
- I feel sick.

544
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,322
I got diarrhea.
My mouth is dry.

545
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:24,191
I didn't sleep last night. I
don't want to go. I'm not going.

546
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:25,892
Oh, sure.
You'll talk to him?

547
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:29,430
I love you, you know that.
You're a mother hen.

548
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,464
- Michael, you look fine.
- Stop calling me Michael.

549
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:34,900
We have to go.
It's a very important meeting.

550
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:36,336
And I don't say
that to scare you,

551
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,170
I say that to inspire you.

552
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:40,473
I'm not scared.
I'm a thug.

553
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:43,276
I'm a pig.
I'm part of the problem.

554
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,878
"Now I am become Death.
Destroyer of worlds."

555
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,814
Come on, buddy.
You're not Death.

556
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,416
You got a little stage fright.

557
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,051
Maybe you smoked
too many funny cigarettes.

558
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:55,120
I never touch that stuff.
It makes you crazy.

559
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:57,188
I know what you're feeling
and it's fear.

560
00:26:57,223 --> 00:27:00,559
But not fear of failure,
fear of opportunity.

561
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:02,693
I can't watch this.

562
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:06,196
Look, you can't put yourself in the
right place at the right time.

563
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:08,866
You got to be in the right
place all the time.

564
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,271
Listen, man, I can't turn off
the transmissions to do harm.

565
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:14,938
They're beaming them
right into my head.

566
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:17,107
Damn it, there is
no harm in this!

567
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:19,876
Manischewitz are good people.
They're your people.

568
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,446
And they sell wine for religious
ceremonies of all faiths.

569
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:26,750
Now pull yourself together
and be the man that I admire.

570
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,954
( sighs )

571
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:36,792
Tell me the truth.
Are you a homo?

572
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:39,261
There's that sense of humor.

573
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,908
I would like
to have her for lunch.

574
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:56,243
Well, don't have
Harry Crane set it up.

575
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:58,813
He got us very high up
with three major companies.

576
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,848
You forgot because Chevy
fell in your lap,

577
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:03,718
but big accounts require
a golf and dining offensive.

578
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:05,653
When are we gonna do that?

579
00:28:05,688 --> 00:28:07,287
Next time.

580
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,527
Harry, what did I say
about that car?

581
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,130
( <i>"Harper Valley P.T.A." playing</i> )

582
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:19,833
Well, Cindy, these are
my friends Don and Roger.

583
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,635
A pleasure.

584
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:23,569
There's tacos
and booze outside.

585
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:26,872
If you want a joint, try the
candy dish on the coffee table.

586
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,708
Or make a friend.

587
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:30,409
You look familiar.

588
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:32,745
You'll have to do
better than that.

589
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,991
As you can tell, there's
a different protocol.

590
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,293
I look forward
to figuring it out.

591
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,829
Just let me make introductions.

592
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,731
They don't take business cards.

593
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,598
Who is that?

594
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,500
I know him.

595
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,669
Earl Rice from Kodak.
He's their studio rep.

596
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,304
I don't think he was there when you were.
I know he never goes east.

597
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,906
No, not him.
Isn't that Danny?

598
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,042
Jesus, he is everywhere.

599
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,911
It's Daniel J. Siegel now.

600
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:10,113
( chuckles ) Danny Siegel?

601
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:12,749
Producer. And that's Irwin Fields.
He's at Paramount.

602
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:14,283
What's he doing here?

603
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,051
Probably trying to buy
one of Danny's movies.

604
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:17,319
Not him.

605
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:22,258
Roger, Don. Where've
you been all my life?

606
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,694
Come on.
This will be fun.

607
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:27,262
Daniel, my man.
Did we interrupt?

608
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:30,064
It'll keep, man.

609
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,702
Danny. What are you
up to these days?

610
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:37,539
Taking care of business.
That was Irwin Fields.

611
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:41,510
And this is just Lotus.
She's from Sacramento.

612
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:42,877
So how do you know Stephen?

613
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,311
Oh, I've known
Stephen a long time.

614
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:47,147
Whereas Danny we've only
known for a very short time.

615
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:49,316
( laughs )

616
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,019
I know these lugs back
from my days in advertising.

617
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:53,721
More like a day, wasn't it?

618
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:55,589
Hey, it wasn't my bag.
I had to quit.

619
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:57,925
You didn't quit.
You were fired.

620
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,859
( laughs )

621
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,330
Harry, why don't you
introduce me to the bar?

622
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,870
Actually, Danny and I
used to be related.

623
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,406
Daniel.

624
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:15,741
His ex-wife
is still my cousin.

625
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:19,345
You'd like her.
She's about your age.

626
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:21,080
There are small differences.

627
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:23,249
Tiny things you'd notice.

628
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,251
( chuckles )

629
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,019
Stephen.

630
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:28,854
I was just telling Lotus
here how I'm finally

631
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,656
making a picture
with a major studio.

632
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,424
We're gonna do
"Alice in Wonderland."

633
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,359
And Stephen over there

634
00:30:34,393 --> 00:30:37,595
works for Ben Kalmenson,
president of Warner Brothers,

635
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,831
who's also here somewhere.

636
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:42,200
He took over from Jack Warner.

637
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:44,469
You know what, Lotus?

638
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:46,571
I'm gonna introduce you.

639
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,605
Nice rapping with you, Rog.

640
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:01,618
So most of the pictures don't
have a lot of score right now.

641
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,153
They like pop songs. You know,
kids want to hear a hit.

642
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:06,189
I think ads are going
that way, too.

643
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:07,656
What kind of ads you do?

644
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,559
Well, we represent
Chevrolet, Mohawk Airlines.

645
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:12,962
- Where are they?
- The northeast.

646
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,798
Samsonite luggage.
Life Cereal.

647
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:20,202
Well, if times get tough,
I'm gonna look you up, Donny.

648
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:24,006
I dig jingles and I hear
the bread's out of sight.

649
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:31,513
Don, there you are.
Ben Kalmenson's leaving.

650
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:34,483
I think he's heading to a party in the canyon.
Should we follow him?

651
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,151
- You know Ben?
- Do you?

652
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:39,487
( <i>"Rag Ahir Bhairav" plays</i> )

653
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:47,094
I was looking for the restroom.

654
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:50,998
Well, there's an extra nipple
here when you come back.

655
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,700
It can wait.

656
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,769
Take off your shoes.

657
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,349
Do you like hashish?

658
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:12,384
I don't know yet.

659
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,595
Man: <i>Hey Man, are you the
guy who came in a taxi?</i>

660
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:34,650
You don't talk much, do you?

661
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,619
In fact, I'm wondering if
you're hearing a word I say.

662
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:38,421
Are you tripping?

663
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,692
I've done it five times.

664
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:44,659
So if you're trying
to see through me,

665
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:46,628
just know that
I am this handsome

666
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:48,363
and this rich.

667
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:50,498
Don't worry
about your hang-ups.

668
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:54,569
Lotus, let's split.

669
00:32:54,604 --> 00:32:57,439
( laughs ) Together?

670
00:32:57,473 --> 00:32:59,941
She's gonna crash
in my guesthouse.

671
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:02,210
- Until her audition?
- It's up to her, man.

672
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:03,911
I'm sure it is.
Lotus, honey,

673
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:05,312
there's no reason
to start at the bottom.

674
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:07,481
Yeah, maybe he can help
your dream come true

675
00:33:07,515 --> 00:33:09,416
of having your lips
on the side of a bus.

676
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:11,886
What are you gonna do when you fail here?
Keep going west?

677
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,188
Japan's a long walk
for those little legs.

678
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:17,590
Lotus, let's go.

679
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,659
You're lucky
I hate violence, man.

680
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:21,228
Really? I love it.

681
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:22,929
You know, I was a boxer.

682
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:24,998
There's nothing like
finding that magic spot

683
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:26,599
that'll drop a man
to his knees.

684
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:28,869
You know, unless he's
already starting there.

685
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:31,436
- ( groans )
- ( Lotus giggles )

686
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,040
Hated to do that.

687
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:42,047
( groans )

688
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:43,983
Mmm.

689
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:45,450
( <i>"Found Love" playing</i> )

690
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,585
I'm really thirsty.

691
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:51,489
There's a pool full of
water out there, Don.

692
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:54,159
I told you, that's not my name.

693
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:10,473
There you are.

694
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:13,677
Honey, I--

695
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:18,115
you're here.

696
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:19,748
Is that your old lady?

697
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:22,484
It's cool.
It's California.

698
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,821
Everybody shares.

699
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,623
What are you doing here?

700
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:30,159
I thought I'd surprise you.

701
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:33,796
How did you find me?

702
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:36,298
But I live here.

703
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,237
I quit my job.

704
00:34:42,271 --> 00:34:44,572
I couldn't bear to be apart.

705
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:48,810
And I want to have enough love

706
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,878
for my other surprise.

707
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:58,886
Really?

708
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,022
What do you think it is?

709
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:04,191
A second chance.

710
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:08,527
Come with me.

711
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:47,932
Everybody's looking for you.

712
00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:58,375
I heard you were here.

713
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:01,878
Are you in
the movie business, too?

714
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,481
I'm not pitching
for the Dodgers.

715
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:07,750
What happened?

716
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:10,253
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

717
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:13,889
My wife thinks I'm MIA,
but I'm actually dead.

718
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,493
How come you didn't
get your arm back?

719
00:36:18,528 --> 00:36:20,429
Dying doesn't make you whole.

720
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:22,497
You should see
what you look like.

721
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,667
Roger:
<i>Man overboard!</i>

722
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,902
<i>( muffled screaming )</i>

723
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:38,146
( coughing )

724
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,516
He's fine.
Everybody back away.

725
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:49,056
( coughs )

726
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:53,860
( panting )

727
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:04,937
- Is it real? - They took me to breakfast
on the way to the airport

728
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,706
and told me Jack signed off.
And he's high enough at Chevy

729
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,775
he doesn't have to run it
by the whole outfit and--

730
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:11,810
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Moira: <i>Bob Benson to see you both.</i>

731
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:13,346
They finally let me
see the car.

732
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,880
They had clay models.
It's not a dog.

733
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:17,682
I don't mean to interrupt.

734
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:20,718
- But that's what you're doing.
- Come on in, Bob.

735
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:25,790
I just got off the phone
with Manischewitz.

736
00:37:25,824 --> 00:37:27,725
Apparently they're
putting us in review.

737
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:31,329
- What happened?
- They barely listened to the presentation.

738
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:34,365
It was a courtesy. They haven't
liked the work for months.

739
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,433
Shit!
Weren't you there?

740
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:38,703
Well, I thought it was
high time we embraced Bob.

741
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:41,338
He was going to go.
I talked him out of it.

742
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:45,042
Roger Sterling let you
watch his dog and it ran away.

743
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:50,881
Bob, we appreciate you
handling this like a man.

744
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,749
And as a reward,

745
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:55,885
Ted and I want you to familiarize
yourself with Chevy.

746
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:58,187
We just found out
we're moving to the next step.

747
00:37:58,222 --> 00:38:01,190
We're going to need
more than Ken in Detroit.

748
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:04,460
That's music to my ears.

749
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,496
Welcome aboard.

750
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,935
They shouldn't have
gone to California.

751
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:16,638
We're going to bring in Avon.
They gave us Chevy.

752
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:18,473
Throw in losing
Sterling's account,

753
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:20,375
I think we have
a lot of good news.

754
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,177
They're not gonna think that.

755
00:38:22,211 --> 00:38:25,013
You're splitting this place
and not in half.

756
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:28,115
We'll give them something
to take their mind off it.

757
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,816
What do we have?

758
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,159
( coughs )

759
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:43,229
You caught a cold
in California.

760
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:45,465
I don't know what happened.

761
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:47,900
I usually feel
better out there.

762
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:50,203
You've got to stop
talking in the past.

763
00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:52,205
You know what I learned?

764
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:55,341
New York is the center
of the universe.

765
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,277
We could send
a landing craft out there,

766
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:59,744
but they don't understand
what we do.

767
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:01,780
Or they understand it
thoroughly.

768
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:04,483
My shrink says
the job of your life

769
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:05,984
is to know yourself.

770
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:09,488
<i>Sooner or later, you'll start</i>
<i>to love who you are.</i>

771
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:12,524
And apparently
I'm a curious child

772
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,926
with a full head of hair
and a thriving business.

773
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,132
And you're a terrible swimmer.

774
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,434
( chuckles )

775
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,914
- <i>( knocking )</i>
- Come in.

776
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:38,282
Mr. Campbell wants to see you
in the conference room.

777
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:42,586
Oh.
And what is it regarding?

778
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,456
Avon sent over a box
of samples to the girls

779
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,224
and Diane opened it, not me.

780
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:50,761
I'll be right in.

781
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:55,631
Everyone out!

782
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,968
She'll be right in.

783
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,737
This shouldn't be in here.

784
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,774
What the hell is this?

785
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:07,043
I guess Avon's serious.

786
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:08,878
Oh, they're serious.

787
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:11,480
When the hell did you have
a "productive breakfast"?

788
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:13,915
You and Peggy ditched me.

789
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,750
Peggy didn't know.

790
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:18,020
There was some confusion
and then it was too late

791
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:19,421
and I thought since
I mixed things up--

792
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,922
There was no confusion.

793
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,126
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I bet you are.

794
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,428
Were you coming in here to
celebrate what a fool I am?

795
00:40:27,463 --> 00:40:29,563
You upset the girls. They
have nothing to do with this.

796
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:31,466
So, you opening up
your own agency?

797
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,201
Ted assigned her.

798
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,470
Isn't the point
that Avon's happy?

799
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:37,571
Oh, I bet you're
making him very happy.

800
00:40:37,606 --> 00:40:40,041
Because it's better
than being screwed by you.

801
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:42,809
We'll see what Ted
has to say about this.

802
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:50,017
Let me handle Ted.

803
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:51,918
It's too late for that.

804
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,831
- Ask her. - Did you meet with
Avon and not invite Pete?

805
00:41:05,865 --> 00:41:07,133
It was very
last-minute.

806
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,901
Peggy, this doesn't
concern you.

807
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,486
Pete:
<i>This is unacceptable</i>

808
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,854
<i>and I'd like to know what you
have to say for yourself.</i>

809
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,590
- Does this color look good on me?
- Shh!

810
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,825
What would you like
for me to say?

811
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,695
Joan, you of all people
can't plead ignorance.

812
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,031
She's going to say something
about <i>her</i> client

813
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,033
and <i>her</i> connection.

814
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,168
And, honestly, I take
no issue with that.

815
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,671
But what we have here is a breach of the
fundamental rules of this business.

816
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:51,174
<i>An account executive</i>
<i>signs business</i>

817
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,477
and they send their junior
to maintain it.

818
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,580
To maintain their boss's
relationship.

819
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,950
The entire thing falls apart

820
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:03,085
if I send you
to the store to get cake

821
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,488
and you eat it on the way home.

822
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:09,724
Did you really try
to squeeze him out?

823
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:18,031
Pete: <i>You have nothing
to say for yourself?</i>

824
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,567
It's a revolt.

825
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:24,905
- Excuse me.
- Meredith, not now.

826
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:29,376
"Joan, Andrew Hayes from Avon

827
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:31,678
is on the phone
for you."

828
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:35,482
Oh, it just gets better.

829
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:39,085
What are you waiting for?
Go take it.

830
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:48,628
- Pete: <i>That's it?</i>
- Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

831
00:42:48,662 --> 00:42:50,962
Only where there is no law.

832
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:53,165
Pete! We're all
working together.

833
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,467
All agency business
is your business.

834
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:03,342
Thank you.

835
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,551
You better hope
he really calls.

836
00:43:17,256 --> 00:43:19,690
<i>( door closes )</i>

837
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:27,130
Welcome back.
How was your trip?

838
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:29,065
If you don't mind,
this is urgent.

839
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,034
Aren't you glad you
didn't go straight home?

840
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:44,380
I have to tell you that in your
absence, things have become quite dire.

841
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,182
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Dawn: <i>Mr. Draper, the partners are here.</i>

842
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:49,551
Come in.

843
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,120
Welcome back.
How was California?

844
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:55,157
It was a series of busts
and not the kind I like.

845
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:57,625
Well, we have a bit
of news concerning the firm.

846
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,195
- We should get Joan.
- No.

847
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:03,030
- Anyone else?
- No, thank you.

848
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:05,132
My visit to Detroit
was a success.

849
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:07,702
<i>They finally signed off</i>
<i>on the strategy.</i>

850
00:44:07,736 --> 00:44:08,869
Even showed me
a model of the car.

851
00:44:08,904 --> 00:44:11,471
That's a relief.
Good work.

852
00:44:11,506 --> 00:44:14,575
Also, Joan's at the five-yard
line with Avon Cosmetics.

853
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:15,743
Joan?

854
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:18,411
Well, well, well.
While the cat's away...

855
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:22,716
Unfortunately, Manischewitz
has put us in review.

856
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,317
Ah, it's been coming
for months.

857
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:26,352
But that's not what
we're here to talk about.

858
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:29,923
We thought long and hard about what it's
gonna take to make this agency stable.

859
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:33,592
I'd like to offer what we believe
to be a deferential solution.

860
00:44:33,626 --> 00:44:37,696
They want to call the agency
Sterling Cooper & Partners.

861
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:40,465
Well, we know you like it.

862
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:43,902
It would depend on Don, Jim,
and me all sharing the blow.

863
00:44:43,937 --> 00:44:45,337
You're willing to do that?

864
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:50,174
It's the only thing that's
equally offensive to all.

865
00:44:53,045 --> 00:44:55,012
SC ampersand P.

866
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:56,681
I can swallow it if you can.

867
00:44:56,716 --> 00:44:58,650
I don't think
I should weigh in on this.

868
00:44:58,684 --> 00:45:01,018
Good.
Then it's settled.

869
00:45:01,053 --> 00:45:02,587
I'll get the art
department on a logo.

870
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:12,229
- Nice work.
- I had nothing to do with it.

871
00:45:12,264 --> 00:45:14,398
Have a good weekend.

872
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:20,103
You have no problems with this?

873
00:45:20,138 --> 00:45:22,938
Pete, we're in the same
boat and I'm fine with it.

874
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:26,075
Trust me, that name
is a consolation prize.

875
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:28,244
It's a gravestone
to our resistance.

876
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:30,212
You have no idea
what's going on out there.

877
00:45:30,247 --> 00:45:32,114
This is not
the same business anymore.

878
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:35,318
If you don't like it, maybe it's
time to get out of the business.

879
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:43,592
Dawn, could you get
my wife on the phone?

880
00:46:02,744 --> 00:46:04,478
What are you doing?

881
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:06,380
Working.

882
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:08,482
Give me that.

883
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:10,249
Hey.
