00:00:01,804 --> 00:00:04,206
When we land Jaguar,
the world will know.

3
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:06,715
Herb Rennet has demanded
to spend a night with Joan.

4
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:08,432
This is some very
dirty business.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,074
I wanted to tell you
it's not worth it.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,820
Tell them I want a partnership.
Not silent.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,345
I want all the partners here.

8
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:20,532
First thing tomorrow morning we're going
to find you an apartment in the city.

9
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:23,395
- I need you right now.
- Megan...

10
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:25,413
It's the only thing
I'm good for.

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,248
<i>I think she just...</i>
needed her mother.

12
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:31,643
I'm tired of trying to prove
I still have a value around here.

13
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,646
It's what happens when
you help someone...

14
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:35,233
they succeed and move on.

15
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,863
Don't you want them to?

16
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,792
Miss Calvet, could you
step in, please?

17
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:42,648
You know I love you.

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,515
Are you alone?

<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:52,416
Mmm.

28
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,069
Mahalo.

29
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:57,271
It's still suite 282.

30
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,862
How long has it been?

31
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:07,748
Can't get too suntanned,
they'll fire me.

32
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:16,974
Oh, you must have
gotten it wet.

33
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,609
Let me see.

34
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:22,796
You know what?
Who cares what time it is?

35
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,378
You would not have liked that.

36
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:38,946
You wouldn't have
liked it at all.

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,382
I had to walk down the beach
away from the crowds

38
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,851
to this surf shop and knock
on a door with a closed sign.

39
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,853
It was so seedy down there.

40
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:49,640
Plus, I had to get
my money from here.

41
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,668
Come on.

42
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,753
I know you've tried it,
but you haven't had sex high.

43
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:05,222
It makes it so much
more intense.

44
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:53,237
Everything you see on your
plate is what you would find

45
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:54,855
in a royal Hawaiian feast.

46
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,624
<i>That purple pudding is poi.</i>

47
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,827
<i>It's strange, but satisfying.</i>

48
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:03,681
And we Hawaiians
say that it's <i>ono,</i>

49
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,683
<i>which means tasty.</i>

50
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:09,820
But you might just say,
"Ono, I'm not eating that."

51
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:14,324
This is real Hawaiian food.

52
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:16,126
Even the macaroni salad.

53
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:18,545
But, of course,
at the Royal Hawaiian,

54
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,614
we try to treat
every guest like they're--

55
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:22,383
Well, everything
is better here.

56
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,084
I'm sure it is.

57
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,437
It must take a lot of work
to stand out in paradise.

58
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,188
Don, you have to try this.

59
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:29,890
Oh, don't bother.
It's wallpaper paste.

60
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,825
Just eat the pig.

61
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:34,828
<i>Now, while you stay
with us at the lovely,</i>

62
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:36,663
<i>beautiful Royal Hawaiian,</i>

63
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:40,000
make sure you see
enchanted Diamond Head

64
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:42,770
and all of the natural
wonders of the island

65
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,304
by bus or by boat.

66
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,673
<i>It's easy if you book</i>

67
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,793
<i>one of our guided tours</i>
<i>in the lobby.</i>

68
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,216
Aloha.

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,418
Come. Come dance.

70
00:04:58,436 --> 00:04:59,853
I've got nothing
to do with this.

71
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:02,056
Go ahead, Don.

72
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,557
Leave him alone, honey.

73
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,959
I want to do it.

74
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,312
No, you have to
do it like this.

75
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,498
You have to relax.

76
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:30,501
Get in the spirit
of the islands.

77
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,190
They call me
the Hawaiian Elvis.

78
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:40,294
Gentlemen, I remind you,

79
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:42,246
this is my job.

80
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,522
Stop laughing or I'll make
them come back for you.

81
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:55,692
Excuse me, Corinne.
I hate to bother you.

82
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,661
I mean, I know
your name's not Corinne.

83
00:05:57,695 --> 00:06:00,614
No, It's Megan Calvet.

84
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:03,917
- Oh, my goodness. I'm really
bothering you. - No, not at all.

85
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,453
<i>You're so much trimmer than you are on TV.
Do people tell you that?</i>

86
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:10,124
- I-- no.
- "To Have and to Hold" is my favorite.

87
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:13,059
I mean, I watch a few, and
you're obviously on vacation.

88
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:15,913
- It's okay. - Well, I know you're
new to "Berkshire Falls,"

89
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:19,366
but I can tell you--
you just have a way.

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,251
Thank you so much.

91
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:23,637
Would you mind signing
an autograph to my niece?

92
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:25,689
She's a bigger fan than I am.

93
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,108
I'd be delighted.

94
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:38,635
- What's her name?
- Karen.

95
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,354
It's like Corinne.

96
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:43,757
I can't believe
Victor won't acknowledge you.

97
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:46,560
Well, we'll see what happens.

98
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:48,912
<i>Enjoy your stay.</i>

99
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:09,449
Those women really knew me.

100
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:11,351
One of them was from Minnesota.

101
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,887
I didn't even know
they had the show there.

102
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:29,269
I love it here.

103
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:59,232
Hey, Galloway,
you want another?

104
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,868
Can I get a tall beer?
Chop chop.

105
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:07,241
So, mister,
has he moved at all?

106
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,863
Well, you're either dead
or you've got great balance.

107
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:16,833
Hey, were you in the service?

108
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:19,653
I got the same one.

109
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:31,398
- What branch?
- Army.

110
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,116
You can say that again.

111
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,235
- Korea?
- Briefly.

112
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,571
Was Korea like this?

113
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:40,924
'Cause I'll tell you, they
offer you R&R in Honolulu

114
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:44,678
and you think, "Did anybody
notice it's the same place?"

115
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,781
<i>But I'm glad to be here,</i>
<i>I can tell you that.</i>

116
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:50,033
You on your anniversary?

117
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,787
Folks have been
pretty friendly.

118
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:56,990
After all the shit that went
on last summer Stateside,

119
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,226
I was looking for a fight.

120
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,431
That'd be classy-- showing
up with a black eye.

121
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,633
This is my bachelor party.

122
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:09,436
I'm getting married tomorrow.

123
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:12,839
Congratulations.
Let me buy you a drink.

124
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:15,559
Nah, I got a shitload
of combat pay.

125
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:17,477
Let me buy you one.

126
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:20,380
You some kind of astronaut?

127
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:21,982
I'm in advertising.

128
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:25,519
We got this .50 caliber
machine gun.

129
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,487
The M2.

130
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,791
You should see what it does
to a water buffalo.

131
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:35,395
Oh, my Lord. I could
paint this place red.

132
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,130
How long do you have left?

133
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:39,533
Ceremony's at 0800.

134
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,285
Four hours or so.

135
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:45,038
No, in Vietnam.

136
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:46,573
Eight months.

137
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,142
Someone told her
married guys live longer

138
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:51,645
'cause they got
something to live for.

139
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,881
She's from San Diego.

140
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,050
She's Mexican.

141
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:00,921
She met me halfway in Hawaii.

142
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,590
I met her halfway
by getting married.

143
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:06,292
Were you married
when you were in Korea?

144
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,494
No.

145
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,279
And you made it.

146
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:12,098
Listen, Lieutenant.

147
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:15,001
What do you say
we get into some trouble?

148
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:18,738
It's PFC Dinkins, by the way.

149
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,175
It's usually
printed right there.

150
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:23,677
Don.

151
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:28,448
So how do you feel
about giving away the bride?

152
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:30,167
You don't think your
friend's gonna make it?

153
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:33,003
Nah, he's my best man.

154
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:35,321
Her family's in San Ysidro.

155
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,093
And I don't want some hotel
employee being her dad.

156
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,697
They look just like the enemy.

157
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:45,899
Am I wrong?

158
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,935
There's plenty of GIs here.
There's no one else you know?

159
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,104
Who gave your bride away?

160
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,641
I'd love to help you out,
but you don't even know me.

161
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,176
I think you'd regret it later.

162
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,196
I believe in what
goes around comes around.

163
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:03,349
One day I'm gonna be
a veteran in paradise.

164
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,186
One day I'll be the man
who can't sleep

165
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,989
and talks to strangers.

166
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:55,335
<i>I, James, take you, Connie,</i>
<i>for my lawful wife,</i>

167
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,572
to have and to hold
from this day forward.

168
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:01,374
For better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer,

169
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:03,510
in sickness and in health,

170
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:05,028
<i>until death do us part.</i>

171
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,667
What were you doing wrong?

172
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,645
I'm so sorry, Officer.
It's very hard to see.

173
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,381
That's why you
have to drive slower.

174
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:44,084
<i>We go easy on the speed limit
here, but not with this ice.</i>

175
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:45,719
I promise I will do that
in the future.

176
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:47,621
I'm afraid this is about
what you already did.

177
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:50,690
You may not be aware,
but this is Betty Francis.

178
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:53,393
You may know her husband,
my son, Henry Francis.

179
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:56,563
He works in the mayor's office in Manhattan.
Mayor Lindsay.

180
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:59,833
I work for New York State.
We've got our own mayor.

181
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,068
I'll do without
your sarcasm, young man.

182
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:04,337
Now, if you don't mind,

183
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:06,606
I think all concerned
will be very content

184
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:09,609
if you issue a stern warning
and let us be on our way.

185
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:11,645
Pauline.

186
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,114
I'm trying to avoid taking you
off the road with a shovel.

187
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:16,416
She's driving like a maniac.

188
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,134
Yell at her.

189
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,789
I hate cops.

190
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,824
Nonsense. They're just
doing their job.

191
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,927
Well, they're too enthusiastic.

192
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,763
That ruined it.
That ruined everything.

193
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:32,365
I can't imagine it getting
any darker than this.

194
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,134
My mom's dead.

195
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:46,179
How was "The Nutcracker"?

196
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,765
- The highlight of the evening.
- Magical as always.

197
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,185
Well, Bobby, Gene, and I
are sorry we missed it.

198
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,854
Nothing like the ballet,
right, boys?

199
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:56,823
Is Sandy sleeping over?

200
00:13:56,857 --> 00:13:58,891
What do you care?

201
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,335
Isn't somebody
going to say something?

202
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:11,688
Betty got a ticket.

203
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:13,490
For what?

204
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:16,326
I thought it was
going to be speeding,

205
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,828
but apparently
it's reckless driving.

206
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:21,298
I want you to tell your wife

207
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:23,967
that invoking your name in an
interaction with a state trooper

208
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,451
is nothing to be ashamed of.

209
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:27,420
Ma, it barely works for me.

210
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:29,639
Then Grandma Pauline
yelled at him.

211
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:32,659
- I did nothing of the sort.
- What did he do?

212
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,278
- He was verbally abusive.
- Give him the ticket.

213
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:36,929
He'll fix it.
He does it for everyone.

214
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,898
Ma, you know how I fix
those tickets?

215
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:40,433
I pay 'em.

216
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:42,702
- Can I open it?
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:44,671
Get away, you little weirdo.

218
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,874
I like the case.
It looks like a coffin.

219
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:50,593
Would you play a little?
That'd be nice.

220
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,445
I don't know.

221
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,849
Please. It makes
me feel so much.

222
00:14:57,435 --> 00:15:00,654
This is disgusting.
Don't let them force you.

223
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:02,489
Have you been playing long?

224
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:06,126
- She's going to Juilliard next semester.
- Juilliard?

225
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,362
Why didn't you tell me we were
in the presence of a prodigy?

226
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:11,698
15 is not a prodigy.

227
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:10,356
Sorry about that.
Checking the steam.

228
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:12,859
- How was your trip?
- Wonderful.

229
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:15,095
Warm.
I did not miss this.

230
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:17,297
How are you feeling?

231
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:23,653
Let me in there.

232
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,989
<i>It's okay, Jonesy.</i>

233
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:28,775
- Jesus, what's his real name?
- I don't know.

234
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:34,748
Open his coat.
Open his coat.

235
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,633
Sylvia, call an ambulance.

236
00:16:38,586 --> 00:16:40,503
There's a phone at the desk.

237
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:44,724
Okay, Jonesy,
keep listening to me.

238
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,826
Come on,
I know you can hear me.

239
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:49,796
<i>Come on.</i>

240
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,948
Let me get those.

241
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,200
- Absolutely not.
- I'm surprised you're back at work.

242
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,068
Oh, the missus couldn't wait
to get me out of the house.

243
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:58,705
- I don't believe it.
- Oh, wait.

244
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:01,508
Messenger came with
your script yesterday.

245
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,376
I didn't let it
out of my sight.

246
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:05,979
I got you a pretty nice
bottle for Christmas

247
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,730
in case you can't
read the handwriting.

248
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,016
Well, I hope you got
Dr. Rosen a case.

249
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,589
I thought you were going to
stop reading that before bed.

250
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:21,407
It's not bothering me tonight.

251
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:23,543
I bet it isn't.

252
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,180
You're so calm
from all that violin.

253
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,282
She plays beautifully.

254
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:32,052
You and Bobby had the same look on
your face when she was playing.

255
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:34,421
She's a year older than Sally.
Shame on you.

256
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:37,624
No one would blame me for leaving
you for a teenage musician.

257
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,693
She's just in the next room.

258
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:42,162
Why don't you go in there
and rape her?

259
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,731
- I'll hold her arms down.
- Betty, what the hell?

260
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:47,033
You said you wanted
to spice things up.

261
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:49,402
Will it ruin it if I'm there?

262
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,304
You know what? If you want
to be alone with her,

263
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,840
I'll put on my housecoat
and take Sally for a ride.

264
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:56,343
You can stick a rag in her mouth
and you won't wake the boys.

265
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:58,311
All right.
All right, Betty.

266
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:02,448
My goodness.
You're blushing.

267
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,440
She left the sliding door open.

268
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,309
There's dirt all over the rug.

269
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,260
Maybe she wanted
to air out the place.

270
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:16,946
I'm gonna take the cleaning
out of her Christmas present.

271
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,032
One scene.

272
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,736
I take somebody's coat
and offer them a drink.

273
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,672
You're the maid.
It's more than ours does.

274
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:28,925
One scene, Don. They send
me to pack suitcases.

275
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,910
Yours or theirs?

276
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,013
Victor's.

277
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:36,016
Then I'd be worried
if I was Victor.

278
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,552
I shouldn't have gone
on vacation.

279
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,876
What are you doing up?

280
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:50,130
I couldn't sleep. I didn't
want to wake Sally,

281
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:52,432
although you have
the creakiest floor.

282
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:56,069
It's an old house.
At least turn on a light.

283
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,023
Are you hungry?

284
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:02,275
Are you gonna have something?

285
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,145
Yes,

286
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,280
but I really have to be
careful this time of year.

287
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:09,215
Why?

288
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,217
I'm trying to reduce.

289
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:15,055
Why don't you just be the way you are?
You're beautiful.

290
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:18,091
That's charming
and you know it.

291
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:25,765
My mother wore
a girdle all the time

292
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,334
and she always had a stomachache
and I always thought,

293
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,838
"You'd rather have a stomachache
just so Dad will like you?"

294
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:35,108
Sandy,

295
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:37,844
my mother passed away
a few years ago

296
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,913
and I understand.

297
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,782
This time of year
is the hardest.

298
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,986
Oh, dear.

299
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,490
We're happy to include
you in our family.

300
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,326
I can't go to Juilliard.

301
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,495
I know how you're feeling.

302
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,164
I was older than you,
but I remember

303
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,366
when I went to Bryn Mawr,
I was terrified.

304
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,335
- But then the minute I--
- No.

305
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,105
I didn't get in.

306
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,140
They rejected me.

307
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,610
Oh.

308
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,715
Of course you'd lie about that.

309
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:20,286
So you'll try again next year.

310
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:23,590
Tell everyone you wanted
to finish high school.

311
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:28,762
It's incredible how fast
some people come up with lies.

312
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,197
Please don't do that.

313
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,001
I'm old for a violinist.

314
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,070
At least for one
as good as I am.

315
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:40,640
I don't care. All I wanted
to do was go to New York.

316
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,975
In a few years.

317
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,843
But it'll be too late.

318
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,045
My feet are already
in wet cement.

319
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,549
Plenty of girls do just
fine without Juilliard.

320
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,752
Sure, you go to college,

321
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:55,588
you meet a boy, you drop out,

322
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,690
you get married,

323
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:00,760
struggle for a year in New York
while he learns to tie a tie,

324
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:04,280
and then move to the country and
just start the whole disaster over.

325
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:07,433
That's an arrogant
exaggeration.

326
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,319
You have so much.

327
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,371
I didn't ask for it
and I don't need it.

328
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:13,289
You don't need it?

329
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:15,107
Do you know what
it's like to have nothing?

330
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,877
- Do you?
- Why do you keep insulting me?

331
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,412
I'm trying to help.

332
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,564
No, aren't you curious?

333
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,516
There are people
in the Village.

334
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,518
I read about it
and I even visited them.

335
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,154
You went to the city alone?
Did Sally go with you?

336
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,156
No.

337
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:32,158
But she told me you went.

338
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,710
That you were a model.

339
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,545
Yes.

340
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,831
And I lived with
five girls in two rooms

341
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:39,499
and ate soup out of cans.

342
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,267
It's not glamorous.

343
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,637
But I bet it was great.

344
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:47,674
It was different back then.

345
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,510
There weren't all
the riots and robberies.

346
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:51,678
Do you watch the news?

347
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:54,113
I visited this building

348
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:56,416
right off St. Mark's Place.

349
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,419
And the kids are just
living and it's beautiful.

350
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:01,321
You know?

351
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:04,307
People are naturally democratic
if you give them a chance.

352
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,592
Are you on dope?

353
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,094
No.

354
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:10,530
- But--
- But...

355
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:13,700
you're going to wait until you're
old enough to live on your own.

356
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,268
It's two years.

357
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:17,270
Hardly a jail sentence.

358
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,540
You know, you're not my child,

359
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:22,442
so there's no reason
for me to say this,

360
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:24,444
but I go to the symphony
quite a bit,

361
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:26,379
whether I like it or not,

362
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:30,383
and I am certain
that you are talented.

363
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,354
And on the bright side,

364
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:36,823
Sally was crushed
you were going away.

365
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,198
Want to use the bathroom?

366
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,884
- I think I'm feeling better.
- I'm not.

367
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,472
- There's Pepto-Bismol.
- I think it's too late.

368
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:56,342
I don't like vegetarian food.

369
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,611
Reminds me of Lent.

370
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:00,780
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>It's a punishment.</i>

371
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:06,753
- Hello?
- Peggy Olson, please.

372
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,388
This is Peggy.
Who is this?

373
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:10,773
- Did you watch Carson?
- Who is this?

374
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:13,559
It's Burt.
Burt Peterson.

375
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:16,362
Oh.
Is everything okay?

376
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:20,133
I'm calling you at midnight.
We're screwed, Peggy.

377
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:23,369
We're at DEFCON 3. We're
about to go to DEFCON 4.

378
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:25,738
DEFCON 4 is better
than DEFCON 3.

379
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,941
I've told you that.
One is the worst.

380
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,443
- Then we're at zero.
- There is no zero.

381
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:34,414
Some comic on Carson was breaking everybody
up with this routine about the war.

382
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:38,084
Burt, it's very late and you
sound a little under the weather

383
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:40,653
and there's such a thing
as free speech in this country.

384
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:44,190
I could give a hoot. Koss Headphones
wants to pull our Super Bowl spot.

385
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:46,693
<i>He hates the line now.</i>

386
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:50,029
"Lend me your ears"?
It's Shakespeare.

387
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:52,665
Well, it's somehow related
to something.

388
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,001
<i>The president.</i>
<i>I don't know. I didn't see it.</i>

389
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,804
<i>You there?</i>

390
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:59,472
Yes.

391
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,674
<i>So you got to change your ad.</i>

392
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:04,610
- Now it's my ad?
- <i>He wants to meet for a discussion.</i>

393
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:07,163
- About what?
- I don't know. Something bad.

394
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,948
I take the client's
word for it.

395
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:10,950
- You've got to call Ted.
- About what?

396
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:12,618
I don't even know
what the problem is.

397
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:15,421
It's better coming from you.
I've got to go.

398
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:28,234
What time is it in Colorado?

399
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:31,571
<i>I don't know. I can't
do any math right now.</i>

400
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:32,889
<i>I can't do any math at all.</i>

401
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:35,224
Please, honey, don't talk.

402
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,764
Morning.

403
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,400
I guess I don't say
Merry Christmas to you.

404
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:48,071
Save that for Sylvia.
How was Hawaii?

405
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:50,089
Long ago and far away.

406
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:52,224
What's that camera
you guys are selling?

407
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,860
- Pentax?
- Leica.

408
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:57,063
And which model
will change my life?

409
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,782
Like everybody else, I only
know them by the price.

410
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,951
You know what?

411
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,836
Come by.

412
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:06,839
I got a closetful.
I'll give you one.

413
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,508
Come on.
I'll pay for it.

414
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,409
I'd give one
to Christiaan Barnard.

415
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,878
I might just come by.

416
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:14,197
You owe me just for
that comment alone.

417
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:16,148
- You can come by right now.
- No.

418
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,334
I'm gonna be in surgery till 2:00.
Maybe after.

419
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:21,921
Remember, you come by my
office, I get to go to yours.

420
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:26,426
<i>Another glorious
morning, Dr. Rosen.</i>

421
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,345
No good deed...

422
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:31,064
I don't know.

423
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:33,566
Probably part of
a deeper question.

424
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,170
Because, I mean, none of them are
really blonde anyway, right?

425
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,338
She's 29 years old.

426
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,542
Hair darkens by that age,
so she's probably a brunette.

427
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:45,094
Maybe she does
remind me of Jane.

428
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,880
No, I think it's more
than just distraction.

429
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,082
I think you're being
hard on me.

430
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,351
You used the word
"distraction."

431
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,204
Did I?
Well, I need a vacation.

432
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm busy.
I'm a busy man.

433
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:00,543
I walk around that place,
people say "Good morning" to me.

434
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:02,879
They don't really care. They
don't know anything about me.

435
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:06,499
Oh, God, Doc,
what is it all about?

436
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,434
Help me.

437
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,238
I say--
I say that's a joke, son.

438
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,824
- We discussed this.
- What?

439
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:16,709
I can't laugh
at everything you say.

440
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,511
Either it's funny or it's not.

441
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:20,213
I don't know how
you can control yourself.

442
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:23,583
It's hard sometimes.
We talked about that, too.

443
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,985
What exactly
are you joking about?

444
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,088
You're obviously not afraid
that you're boring.

445
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,224
What are the events in life?

446
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,259
It's like you see a door.

447
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,261
The first time you come
to it you say,

448
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:38,064
"Oh, what's on the other
side of the door?"

449
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,099
Then you open a few doors.

450
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:42,235
Then you say, "I think I want to
go over that bridge this time.

451
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,304
I'm tired of doors." Finally you
go through one of these things

452
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,590
and you come out the other side and
you realize that's all there are--

453
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:51,060
doors and windows
and bridges and gates.

454
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:53,379
And they all open the same way

455
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:55,815
and they all close behind you.

456
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,419
Look, life is supposed
to be a path and you go along

457
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,988
and these things happen to you and
they're supposed to change you.

458
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:06,709
Change your direction. But it
turns out that's not true.

459
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,662
It turns out the experiences
are nothing.

460
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,732
They're just some pennies
you pick up off the floor,

461
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,134
stick in your pocket, and you're
just going in a straight line

462
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:17,186
to you-know-where.

463
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:18,771
You sound afraid.

464
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,273
More like irritated.

465
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,275
And what do you think
is causing that?

466
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,310
Top of the list, New Year's.

467
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:26,412
It's like an extra birthday.

468
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:28,347
You're supposed to blow out the
candle and wish for something.

469
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,967
I don't even know what it is.

470
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,321
How was your Christmas?

471
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:37,773
Same as the last five--
ruined by work.

472
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,526
- How was yours?
- I'm a widower, Peggy.

473
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,945
Oh. I'm sorry.

474
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:48,918
Apparently there was a bunch
of jokes on the "Tonight Show,"

475
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:53,723
in question, about soldiers
cutting off ears in Vietnam.

476
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,943
And obviously we are gonna have
to go in another direction.

477
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:59,111
_

478
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,580
What did they say?

479
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,248
Well, I wasn't able

480
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,983
to obtain a copy
or a transcript,

481
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:06,502
but Lawrence here
is a devout viewer.

482
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:08,654
I don't know
if I can do it justice.

483
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:10,840
Just shut up and do it.

484
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:18,014
Well, he came out
and started talking about

485
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:19,932
how that surgeon
in South Africa

486
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:22,301
transplanted a heart.
And he says,

487
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:25,788
"Now I know what I'm getting
President Johnson for Christmas."

488
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:28,474
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Lawrence.

489
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:31,177
- No, the comedian.
- We're finding that out.

490
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,313
- You have no information.
- We know the host was Phyllis Diller.

491
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:36,716
Get to the ears.

492
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,602
Well, I don't remember
how he got to it,

493
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,721
but it was something about how

494
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:44,106
the first transplants
they did were with dogs.

495
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:47,576
So obviously there could be some
sort of mix-up or something.

496
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:51,113
Dad's better, but he goes nuts
every time we run the can opener.

497
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:54,834
He hates the mailman or something.

498
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:59,055
And, oh, he keeps
ruining the carpet.

499
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:02,375
Only thing that stops him is hitting him
on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.

500
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:06,379
Do you remember
the ear joke or not?

501
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,498
Well, he went back
to Christmas.

502
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,984
Did you hear about
how there are these GIs

503
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,836
with interesting decorations?

504
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,821
'Cause they cut off
the Vietcong's ears

505
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,524
and wore them on a string around
their neck like a trophy.

506
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:20,926
Oh.
They really did that?

507
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,428
There's a court-martial.

508
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:24,630
Did he actually say
"Vietcong" on Carson?

509
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:27,433
I don't remember.
This is the best I can do.

510
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,919
- I think you're very good.
- You think so?

511
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:32,571
So, was that it?

512
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:34,957
No.
The big laugh was

513
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:36,676
a general comes up
to one of these guys

514
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,295
and says, "That's not
regulation, son."

515
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:42,598
The soldier says, "Pardon? Could
you speak into my necklace?"

516
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,238
Biggest laugh even though the
transplant jokes were better.

517
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:52,024
That's not even funny.
What did Phyllis do?

518
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,110
She just said something like,

519
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,162
"I told you he was
a sick puppy."

520
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,748
When is Koss coming in?

521
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,716
1:00.
Should I order lunch?

522
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,218
He loves the Russian Tea Room.

523
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:03,719
No, this is
an emergency meeting.

524
00:30:03,754 --> 00:30:05,554
I should probably
practice a little more.

525
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,373
The client's already seen it.

526
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:11,010
Go home.
There's no second show.

527
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,850
- What did Ted say?
- I left a message.

528
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,385
I don't think
there's anything to do

529
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:21,887
but work our way through
100 versions of no.

530
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:24,123
Listen, don't get
in your own way.

531
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,158
No, I've seen
creatives do this.

532
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:28,761
I've seen Ted do it.
This is the Super Bowl.

533
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:31,764
It's a lot of money. A lot
of exposure for the agency.

534
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:33,599
- There's probably awards down the road.
- I know.

535
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:35,601
Believe me, I know.

536
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:37,303
The fucking
"Tonight Show."

537
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,755
Now, Peggy,
I think it's the Army

538
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,074
that's really at fault here.

539
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,916
You look tan.
Did you have fun?

540
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,218
I'm sorry,
but your name escapes me.

541
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:10,321
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm upstairs in Accounts.

542
00:31:10,356 --> 00:31:12,657
Beloit College, Wharton MBA.

543
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:15,093
Secor, Mohawk, Life Cereal.

544
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:17,128
You know,
but just in the outfield.

545
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:18,930
Yes, of course.

546
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:20,531
We spoke at
the Christmas party.

547
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:23,768
You seemed to know your way
around Pennsylvania.

548
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:26,738
You want one of these?
I get it right next door.

549
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:30,408
People will take a few extra
steps for a superior product.

550
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,544
Doesn't it belong
to someone else?

551
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:36,180
No, I always get two.
I don't want to share.

552
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:42,570
You know, I have through,

553
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,072
let's just say
low-level corruption,

554
00:31:44,123 --> 00:31:46,490
obtained tickets
to the Cotton Bowl.

555
00:31:46,508 --> 00:31:48,876
Crimson Tide versus Texas A&M.

556
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:52,964
You play football?

557
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,366
- What's in that coffee?
- Excuse me?

558
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,820
Oh.

559
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:01,939
Look, I've been trying
to get to know your team.

560
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:05,610
Not that I'm so important. And
they talk about you all the time.

561
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:08,663
So I guess I figured a few minutes
alone with you shouldn't be wasted.

562
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:10,498
Just a minute, Bob.

563
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:14,652
I smell creativity.

564
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:20,257
I love it down here.

565
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:23,111
I can't believe you just came off
of 10 hours of plane travel.

566
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:25,730
- You look great.
- No, Stan, you look great.

567
00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:28,566
Changing the subject
ever so slightly,

568
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:31,369
during your travels did you
notice if the stewardesses

569
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:34,105
would let a mother hold a baby
on her lap the whole ride?

570
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:35,773
I believe so.

571
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:38,059
- Ha!
- Really?

572
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,044
Don't feel bad. I mean, how would you know?
You never had any kids.

573
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:42,096
Last time you left town,
it was in a covered wagon.

574
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:44,849
Because you're old.

575
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:47,368
You're so tan.

576
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:50,020
- So how was the vacation?
- He was on assignment.

577
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:53,157
On Waikiki Beach. How much work
do you think you got done?

578
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:57,128
Look at him. He has the
sea breeze in his hair.

579
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,297
You bring me something?
Huh?

580
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:01,966
Dictaphone, cocktail napkins?

581
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,735
Anything to give me a jump
on the Royal Hawaiian?

582
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,839
I had an experience.

583
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:10,274
I don't know how
to put it into words.

584
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:16,631
Isn't Sheraton
coming in on Friday?

585
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:18,800
He's still thinking.
He just got back.

586
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:21,469
I'll tell you the experience.

587
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:24,655
Megan in a bikini.

588
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:31,979
Oh, Mr. Draper.
There you are.

589
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,764
Good morning.
How was your trip?

590
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,117
It was good, thank you.
What's going on here?

591
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:39,437
They're taking portraits
for publicity.

592
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:42,573
You certainly look snappy.
I see you have coffee.

593
00:33:42,608 --> 00:33:45,443
I scheduled you later in case you
missed the connection in Los Angeles.

594
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:48,212
Everything went smoothly.

595
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:51,449
Welcome back.

596
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:54,068
I'm jealous
just looking at you.

597
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,155
- I think you'd like it.
- I don't know if it's the photographers

598
00:33:57,189 --> 00:34:00,525
or the writers, but it really
smells like reefer in here.

599
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,126
That has to be enough.

600
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,512
<i>I think we got it.</i>

601
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:08,266
So, they treat you
like King Kamehameha?

602
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:11,569
Miss, you mind?

603
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:20,878
Are these in color?

604
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:22,847
No, and I'm starting
to regret it.

605
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:24,749
Do you mind holding onto
the rail, gorgeous?

606
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:26,667
Think of important things.

607
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:28,469
Caroline, is the
shoeshine here yet?

608
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,121
No one's going
to see your shoes.

609
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,889
- I want you to call him.
- I did.

610
00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:33,924
So, Don Ho...

611
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:36,060
did you have a blue drink
in the white sand?

612
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:39,163
Ernest Borgnine chase you down
an alleyway with a switchblade?

613
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:40,781
I love that movie.

614
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:43,034
It was nice.

615
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:45,636
I think I'm next, but I don't
want to follow that act.

616
00:34:47,306 --> 00:34:50,224
So, you have anything ready
for Sheraton on Friday?

617
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:52,593
Have I ever walked into
this office after an absence

618
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:54,545
and not had you bring up
business immediately?

619
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:56,514
That's only because
I've spent every holiday

620
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:58,532
waiting on work from you.

621
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:01,068
And then you walk away from me.

622
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,371
And then you take a nap.

623
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:06,040
Oh, taking pictures.

624
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,258
Yeah, we'll be done
in a second.

625
00:35:10,596 --> 00:35:13,214
Keep it down out here.

626
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:21,489
Oh, about your office.

627
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,207
They think it's better
for the pictures.

628
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:24,625
I don't agree.

629
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,110
They'll move it back.

630
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:28,746
So when I left, where was I?

631
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,381
I'll get you the files.

632
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:13,457
As horrible as this is,

633
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:16,494
I don't think anyone
has made this connection

634
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,029
outside of this comedian.

635
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:20,798
So it's likely that
any possible controversy--

636
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:22,433
Well, no one's seen
the TV spot.

637
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,268
They've seen the print
for three weeks,

638
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:26,437
side by side with
the news story probably.

639
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:28,005
We haven't heard a peep.

640
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,608
So the controversy
is still in your imagination.

641
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:34,095
I won't deny that,
but this is a horrible thing.

642
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:35,746
I believe
that's the word I used.

643
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:38,466
So?

644
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:43,354
- I thought I had a solution.
- We can't pull the ad.

645
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:45,389
Relax, Burt.
And of course we can't.

646
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:48,659
No, I thought maybe
we could just cut

647
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:50,528
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears"

648
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:52,897
and just start with saying

649
00:36:52,931 --> 00:36:55,199
all the great stuff
about the headphones.

650
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,569
That's a great idea.

651
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:01,972
- You think so?
- I think it's the first idea, but--

652
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:04,275
It solves everything.

653
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:07,712
Except it's just a man in a toga now.
It's a non sequitur.

654
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:10,481
Maybe people will think
it's some kind

655
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:12,583
of sophisticated joke
that they just didn't get.

656
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:15,336
I think that while it avoids

657
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,589
any possibility of controversy,
it neuters the joke.

658
00:37:18,623 --> 00:37:20,591
What the hell does that mean?

659
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,560
Look, you don't
know what to do.

660
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:24,428
I'm telling you what do to.

661
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:27,498
You are. You have
solved the problem.

662
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:29,934
But it needs more
than a solution.

663
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:32,036
It needs to be a great ad.

664
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,708
This is a great place to start.
I just need a little time.

665
00:37:37,743 --> 00:37:39,877
Remember how long it took
us to come up with this one?

666
00:37:39,911 --> 00:37:42,079
I don't know. It just sort
of came to you, didn't it?

667
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:45,116
No, you rejected
a lot of things.

668
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,451
And we can't shoot one of
the things I rejected?

669
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,521
We just don't have the time.

670
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,659
Look, my job is
to introduce your headphones

671
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:59,130
to a huge, drunk,
male audience.

672
00:37:59,164 --> 00:38:01,215
And it's not about my work,

673
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,167
it's about making a great ad.

674
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,302
The association
not being with Vietnam,

675
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:07,838
but with a laugh, a smile,

676
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,840
that all comes
from your headphones.

677
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:12,576
I don't know how to do that.

678
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:14,412
But I do.

679
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:16,347
Give me a couple days.

680
00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:20,985
Okay.

681
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:34,231
You've got to get
a hold of Ted.

682
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:45,356
Why do they all
have "love" in them?

683
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:47,492
- They asked for it.
- It's a big word.

684
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,561
I guess they heard
it on the news.

685
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:56,956
_

686
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:01,055
- What the hell is this?
- They're newlyweds.

687
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,391
This couple doesn't exist.

688
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:06,311
Anything matrimonial
feels Paleolithic.

689
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:09,481
What are you suggesting? A
little Haight-Ashbury colonial?

690
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:12,450
A couple of longhairs in love?
That'll get Dow going.

691
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:14,953
As much as I'd like to join
all the ads making fun

692
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:16,821
of the ubiquitous
San Francisco hippie,

693
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,257
let's try to trade on the word
"love" as something substantial.

694
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,677
I don't think that's
possible in this context.

695
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:25,930
So why are we contributing to
the trivialization of the word?

696
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:28,383
It doesn't belong
in the kitchen.

697
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:31,236
"I love this."
"I love my oven."

698
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,155
<i>"You know what I'd love? I'd love a
hamburger." We're wearing it out.</i>

699
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,125
Let's leave it
where we want it.

700
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,979
We want that electric
jolt to the body.

701
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:43,548
We want Eros.
It's like a drug.

702
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,517
It's not domestic.

703
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,602
What's the difference
between a husband

704
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,421
knocking on a door and a
sailor getting off a ship?

705
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:52,557
About 10,000 volts.

706
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:55,393
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

707
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:58,496
- Don't let me interrupt.
- No, we were...

708
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,832
just finishing up here.

709
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,550
These are great.

710
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:04,219
Good to hear.

711
00:40:04,253 --> 00:40:06,387
- This is a pleasant surprise.
- I got out early.

712
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:08,506
- Is that good or bad?
- What?

713
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,976
Oh, no. Everything's fine.
It was routine.

714
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:14,178
Well...

715
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:16,231
welcome to my hospital.

716
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:20,652
You want a coffee or something?

717
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,370
No.

718
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,706
This is quite a spread.

719
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,009
Well, let's get you set up.

720
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,512
If I looked like you
and talked like that,

721
00:40:30,546 --> 00:40:32,597
I wouldn't have had
to go to medical school.

722
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,816
Please, don't compare
what I do to what you do.

723
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,486
I'm not. Just part of me was
hoping that head was empty.

724
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:40,638
Can't resist cutting
people open, can you?

725
00:40:40,656 --> 00:40:43,341
All right, enough flirting.
Where's my camera?

726
00:40:56,939 --> 00:40:59,891
I think this is the best one.

727
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:01,893
I don't know what to say.

728
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,695
Say you're gonna be
the first American

729
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,997
to complete a successful
heart transplant

730
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:09,400
and that you'll appear in a magazine ad
attributing your success to your Leica.

731
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:11,970
Well, if that's the only way
you can give it to me.

732
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:14,923
- I was looking for you.
- Here I am.

733
00:41:16,592 --> 00:41:18,376
Dr. Arnold Rosen.

734
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:21,279
Sorry, this is Miss Chambers,
my secretary.

735
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,015
I'm sorry, Dr. Rosen. I didn't
know you were coming by.

736
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:26,217
Oh, no, it's not business.
He's a friend.

737
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:29,120
They're ready in your office.

738
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,122
- Who?
- They're setting up.

739
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,791
- The photographer.
- I'll do it.

740
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:36,761
No, you're gonna need a
couple weeks with those instructions.

741
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:39,130
This'll only take a minute.
Have you had lunch?

742
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:40,982
No, I have a full afternoon.

743
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:43,484
But I think our wives are cooking
something up for New Year's.

744
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,803
Told Sylvia to keep
it in the building.

745
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,605
Wasn't my idea.

746
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,774
No, it'll be fun.

747
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,427
As long as I don't have to put
on shoes, it sounds perfect.

748
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:55,430
And again, thanks for the toy.

749
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,121
See, but I'm free tonight.

750
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:05,323
So call in sick.

751
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:08,493
It's easier for them
to replace you than me.

752
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,397
Don't get out of bed yet.

753
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:14,032
Yes?

754
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:17,802
I hate to disturb you,
but it's very urgent.

755
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,437
Okay, okay, sit down.

756
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,109
I have to hang up. Looks
like something bad happened.

757
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:29,013
Well, let me know if your
situation changes. Bye.

758
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,250
Okay. Bye.

759
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:34,636
Bye. Bye.

760
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,523
What the hell is going on?

761
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:42,927
I got some tragic news.
You should sit down.

762
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:45,263
I'll be fine.

763
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:47,565
Here.

764
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:52,070
Your Aunt Jessica called.

765
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:53,538
That's what I hung up for?

766
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:56,307
Your mother passed away
this morning.

767
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,848
Caroline, honey,

768
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,017
she was 91 years old.

769
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,252
It's hardly a shock.

770
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,739
She was such a sweet woman
and I know how close you were.

771
00:43:11,774 --> 00:43:14,726
For 20 years, she's been saying
this is her last Christmas.

772
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,861
She was always so polite to me

773
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:19,830
when she could hear me.

774
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,999
So I suppose I'm in charge
of the arrangements.

775
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,002
You want to call
your aunt back?

776
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,370
Nah.
She's a fruitcake.

777
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:26,871
She'll want to have a séance.

778
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,306
Did she say what happened?

779
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,942
She had a stroke

780
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,677
in the bathroom.

781
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,279
Well, I asked, didn't I?

782
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:40,151
Talk to Joan.
She'll know what to do.

783
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:54,098
Okay, okay.

784
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:56,651
Okay. You're
gonna be okay.

785
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,684
Cheers.

786
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:22,693
Ah, yes.
This is Peggy Olson

787
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:25,696
and I'm calling
for Mr. Chaough.

788
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,832
Yes, this is Peggy Olson.

789
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:33,071
Let's not exaggerate.
I've only called twice.

790
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:36,207
Look, Father--

791
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,809
oh, I'm sorry, Pastor.

792
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,011
I was raised Catholic.

793
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,914
Well, because my mother is.

794
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:44,982
My father is Lutheran.

795
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:48,486
Irish and Norwegian.

796
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,422
No, he passed away.

797
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:52,824
He was cremated.

798
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,792
Look, Pastor, I'm not saying

799
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,761
that you didn't give
Mr. Chaough the message,

800
00:44:56,795 --> 00:45:00,798
I'm just saying that
it bears some urgency.

801
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,935
Yes, which is to say I don't
think it would bother him at all

802
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,104
to know that I'm on the phone.

803
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:09,073
Certainly.
Do you have a pen?

804
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:11,509
This is Peggy Olson

805
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:15,012
and I'm calling
about the Super Bowl.

806
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:18,049
I'm in the office,
he has the number.

807
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,718
How could you possibly have
written that down that fast?

808
00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:27,191
I don't know. I think it's gonna be
Oakland or Houston against Green Bay.

809
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,596
And also with you.

810
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,964
Good night.

811
00:45:39,638 --> 00:45:41,772
Phyllis, can I get some coffee?

812
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:45,309
It's gone cold.

813
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:46,828
Is this really necessary?

814
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:48,546
I just got back from Hawaii.

815
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,248
You're backlit,

816
00:45:50,282 --> 00:45:51,949
so even with the tan you look
like you haven't slept.

817
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:54,285
Don't roll down the sleeves.
Roll them up.

818
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,987
- Really?
- You know what, Chico?

819
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:58,272
Forget the tripod.
Give me the camera.

820
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:01,759
Ahem.

821
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,362
What do I do?

822
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:07,732
I want to see you lost
in that confident thought.

823
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:10,551
I want to see the brains
behind this operation.

824
00:46:10,586 --> 00:46:12,603
Well, for one thing,
I'd be behind the desk

825
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,338
and my desk
would be over there.

826
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,041
Just do what you do.

827
00:46:19,745 --> 00:46:21,946
Give me a minute.

828
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:31,822
<i>That's good.</i>

829
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:36,238
_

830
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:42,046
_

831
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:46,337
What's wrong?

832
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,406
<i>Give me a little</i>
<i>"Front Page."</i>

833
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,576
You know, hands on the desk looking
for an answer out that window.

834
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,410
What?

835
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:56,964
What do you want?

836
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:59,617
I want you to be yourself.

837
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,743
Sorry to wake you
when you're finally sleeping,

838
00:47:18,777 --> 00:47:20,745
but I waited as long
as I could.

839
00:47:22,348 --> 00:47:23,848
What time is it?

840
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,985
They called me and they
want me to work today.

841
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:29,620
I told them about the funeral, but
they can't move it to tomorrow

842
00:47:29,655 --> 00:47:31,556
because they'll need me
then, too.

843
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,193
In fact, they need me
for the rest of the week.

844
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,029
That's good, isn't it?

845
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,799
I called Jeff Hunter, but I think
his service won't wake him.

846
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:44,602
Isn't an agent
supposed to call you?

847
00:47:45,938 --> 00:47:47,939
Good news will keep.

848
00:47:51,377 --> 00:47:53,244
I feel awful about the funeral.

849
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:54,746
Will you please give Roger
my condolences?

850
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,547
Of course.

851
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,883
You should get some sleep.

852
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,153
How can I?
My wife's a big TV star.

853
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,661
Get some sleep.

854
00:48:10,696 --> 00:48:12,463
Break a leg.

855
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,661
Why are you eating? Sandy's
coming over for lunch.

856
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:46,831
First of all, I don't know
why you're counting my meals.

857
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:48,966
And second of all,
Sandy's not coming over.

858
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:51,569
Oh.
That's a shame.

859
00:48:51,603 --> 00:48:53,654
Is she sick?

860
00:48:53,705 --> 00:48:56,207
Sick of being here.

861
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:58,309
She went to Juilliard early.

862
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:02,346
She did?

863
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:03,881
When?

864
00:49:03,915 --> 00:49:06,217
Did you want her to say
a tearful goodbye to you?

865
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,387
Well, frankly, yes.

866
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:11,922
Consider yourself lucky.

867
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,591
She was so stuck-up.

868
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,227
She kept saying how
she really was going

869
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:19,063
to "look back
on this time fondly."

870
00:49:19,098 --> 00:49:21,499
I can't believe she did that.

871
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:24,469
She acts like she's 25
because she uses tampons.

872
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,171
Sally, please.

873
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:29,307
Did she give you her address?

874
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,009
Can you drive Jackie
and me to the movies?

875
00:49:34,913 --> 00:49:37,682
This is a great vacation.

876
00:50:04,643 --> 00:50:07,178
You know, she was like
a sister to me.

877
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,946
A much older sister.

878
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:12,216
How she could have a boy
your age, I don't know.

879
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:14,385
You could be her grandson.

880
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:16,821
You need to
get your eyes checked.

881
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:19,824
- These are stunning rooms.
- Thank you.

882
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:22,660
He is so handsome.

883
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:26,530
I swear you have
not aged a day.

884
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:30,668
Oh, Jane, darling.

885
00:50:30,702 --> 00:50:33,271
- Thank you for coming.
- I thought I should.

886
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:36,190
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I would like to speak first.

887
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:38,109
I think you just did.

888
00:50:38,143 --> 00:50:40,478
No, the eulogies.
The remarks.

889
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:43,347
- I wish to go first.
- Of course. Of course.

890
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:46,551
If you need to speak
to me, I understand.

891
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:52,306
Thank you for rescuing me.

892
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,393
- From your admirers?
- You look wonderful.

893
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:59,230
I don't know if you remember,
but I have her ring.

894
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,431
I don't know
if you want it back.

895
00:51:00,465 --> 00:51:02,033
What am I gonna do with it?

896
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:04,035
For Margaret or...

897
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:05,803
I don't know,
to bury her in it.

898
00:51:05,837 --> 00:51:08,773
We already burned her up.
They steal that stuff anyway.

899
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:10,174
Just keep it.
She liked you.

900
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:12,610
You always paid
your rent on time.

901
00:51:12,644 --> 00:51:15,346
Do you want the victuals
in the parlor?

902
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,548
What?

903
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,883
Hold on, I didn't order
any of this.

904
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:22,553
It's supposed to be
tea and petits fours.

905
00:51:22,571 --> 00:51:24,572
Oh, hell, put it
in the dining room.

906
00:51:26,775 --> 00:51:29,794
- I'm really sorry for your loss.
- She was a great lady.

907
00:51:29,828 --> 00:51:32,163
"Bob Benson, SCDP."
Who the hell is that?

908
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:34,332
That's from us.

909
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:36,801
Daddy, I think it's time.

910
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:39,070
What's the rush?

911
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,906
Thank you for coming.

912
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,844
God, she is all kinds
of trouble, isn't she?

913
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:48,746
Everything turns
you on, doesn't it?

914
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:52,016
Is your mother still alive?

915
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:01,976
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time.

916
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,262
How many funerals
have you been to today?

917
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:06,998
- Excuse me?
- He wants to know where you got the drink.

918
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:10,034
Give my regards to Megan.

919
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:12,436
Rumor has it they're gonna
move her to four days a week.

920
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:14,538
Legend has it.

921
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:18,075
So, is she alive?

922
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,744
Yes, she is.

923
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,214
Don, what about your mother?

924
00:52:23,248 --> 00:52:24,715
Still with us?

925
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,568
I'm gonna watch
from over there.

926
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,854
If I could get your attention.

927
00:52:30,872 --> 00:52:33,190
<i>I'd like to thank</i>
<i>everyone for coming.</i>

928
00:52:33,225 --> 00:52:36,127
I apologize
for the dry atmosphere,

929
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,796
but as I've been reminded
many times today,

930
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,931
<i>Mother did not approve</i>
<i>of libations.</i>

931
00:52:40,966 --> 00:52:43,934
Excuse me, but I have
a few words to say.

932
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:45,436
I insist.

933
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:49,073
Of course. Why don't
you roll on over here?

934
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,052
Can everyone forget
what I've said so far

935
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:04,288
so that Mrs. Hazel Tinsley,
who graciously flew up

936
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,223
from Palm Beach, can have
the honor of going first?

937
00:53:06,258 --> 00:53:07,625
Stay here.

938
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:10,895
<i>I want to say</i>
<i>something, if I may,</i>

939
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:13,114
at this informal moment

940
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,700
because I do not believe
in speaking graveside.

941
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,703
This is where she lived
and this is where she died.

942
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,841
"This woman spent 90 years
on the Earth,

943
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:26,977
of noble birth
and of some advantage,

944
00:53:27,012 --> 00:53:30,715
devoting herself to one man,
but loving another.

945
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,352
That man was Roger."
That's you.

946
00:53:34,386 --> 00:53:38,022
"When Roger Sterling Sr.'s
brief time was over,

947
00:53:38,056 --> 00:53:41,492
it was this Roger
who filled her days.

948
00:53:41,526 --> 00:53:45,996
One could not talk to her without
hearing about his achievements,

949
00:53:46,031 --> 00:53:48,632
<i>his wit, his kindness.</i>

950
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,201
We all said, 'Mimsy.

951
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:53,637
Mims, you should find another man.
Life is long.'

952
00:53:53,672 --> 00:53:56,173
<i>She said, 'I don't need anyone.</i>

953
00:53:56,208 --> 00:54:01,078
My heart is full because
my son is my sunshine.'"

954
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:06,834
Get him out of here.

955
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:12,389
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

956
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,610
Where were you?

957
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:18,245
I'm sorry, but is
that man all right?

958
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,531
- What's he doing here?
- What?

959
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:22,566
- You heard me.
- Can we get someone in here to clean up?

960
00:54:22,584 --> 00:54:24,919
- Let Bruce Pike clean it up.
- Roger.

961
00:54:24,953 --> 00:54:26,670
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

962
00:54:26,705 --> 00:54:28,172
I think it would have
been more respectful

963
00:54:28,206 --> 00:54:29,807
of you not to come.
She didn't like you either.

964
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:31,976
I don't think
I ever met your mother.

965
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,378
She wouldn't if she had. This
is supposed to be just family.

966
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,381
- See how upset everybody is?
- Roger, stop. Stop it this minute.

967
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:39,617
- You shouldn't have brought him.
- Daddy, please.

968
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,652
This is my funeral!

969
00:54:41,686 --> 00:54:44,221
You know what?
Party's over.

970
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:46,924
Everybody out.

971
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:49,693
Thank you very much.
Out!

972
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:06,293
Thank you.

973
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,631
Pardon me.
I'm looking for someone.

974
00:55:10,665 --> 00:55:12,716
Could you help me?

975
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:23,227
Everybody's gone.

976
00:55:23,261 --> 00:55:25,329
Not everybody, obviously.

977
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,998
I think they were overwhelmed
by that touching tribute.

978
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,834
What do you want?

979
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,203
That man never tires
of embarrassing himself.

980
00:55:32,237 --> 00:55:33,838
You're the one who brought him.

981
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,707
I'm talking about Don.

982
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:39,276
Oh. He was just saying what
everybody else was thinking.

983
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,780
You shouldn't have brought him.

984
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:44,515
You're right.

985
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:48,085
Now you have one on me.
Do you feel better?

986
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:50,321
My mother's dead.

987
00:55:50,355 --> 00:55:52,323
I know, Roger.

988
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,593
Must be very hard for you.

989
00:55:55,627 --> 00:55:57,695
I don't feel anything.

990
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,565
You certainly seem emotional.

991
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,133
Because I need a drink.

992
00:56:03,168 --> 00:56:05,769
She lived a long time.

993
00:56:05,804 --> 00:56:08,239
And she knew
that you loved her.

994
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:11,075
So maybe there's nothing
to drink about.

995
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:15,412
I feel like she always wanted to
spend time with me and I never did.

996
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:17,915
That may be something
to consider.

997
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:20,217
You have a family.

998
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,887
Are you kidding me?
I looked out at that crowd

999
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,889
and all I saw was a bunch
more women I've disappointed.

1000
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,691
Roger Sterling,
no matter what you do,

1001
00:56:27,726 --> 00:56:29,927
everyone loves you.

1002
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:33,330
What you're seeing is them worried
about how you feel about them.

1003
00:56:33,365 --> 00:56:36,066
So, you miss me?

1004
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,269
I know your daughter does.

1005
00:56:40,038 --> 00:56:42,239
Don't you wonder what Margaret
will say at your funeral?

1006
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,874
You had to bring that up.

1007
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:45,342
I did.

1008
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:47,344
You should spend
more time with her.

1009
00:56:47,379 --> 00:56:49,179
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1010
00:56:49,214 --> 00:56:52,149
Remember the last time
this bed was covered in furs?

1011
00:56:52,183 --> 00:56:54,485
We rolled around all over them.

1012
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:56,520
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1013
00:56:56,555 --> 00:56:58,355
You look great.

1014
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,457
It would be soothing.

1015
00:57:00,492 --> 00:57:02,459
Soothe yourself.

1016
00:57:02,494 --> 00:57:04,361
I'm gonna clean up.

1017
00:57:18,677 --> 00:57:20,210
Jonesy.

1018
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,729
Mr. Draper,
are you all right?

1019
00:57:21,763 --> 00:57:24,014
- He's not feeling well.
- Hey, Jonesy.

1020
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:26,400
Jonesy, what did you see?

1021
00:57:26,434 --> 00:57:28,552
I didn't see
nothing, Mr. Draper.

1022
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,604
No, no, when you died,
what did you see?

1023
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,023
- Don, let's get you upstairs.
- Wait, I want to know.

1024
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:35,525
I want to know.

1025
00:57:35,543 --> 00:57:37,244
What did you see when you died?

1026
00:57:37,295 --> 00:57:39,747
I don't know. Doc said
I wasn't really dead.

1027
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:42,333
I saw it. You were dead.
He died right there.

1028
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:43,801
What did you see?

1029
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,636
I don't like to think about it.

1030
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,639
- You must have seen something.
- I guess there was a light.

1031
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,841
Was it like hot,
tropical sunshine?

1032
00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:53,343
- I don't know.
- Did you hear the ocean?

1033
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:54,645
Mr. Draper,
you should go upstairs.

1034
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:59,617
- Is he all right?
- He'll be fine.

1035
00:58:02,454 --> 00:58:04,488
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

1036
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,457
- Is that St. Mark's Place?
- Yup.

1037
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:08,592
I'm sorry, I'm looking
for someone.

1038
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:10,311
A girl.

1039
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:12,262
- Which one?
- This one.

1040
00:58:12,296 --> 00:58:14,898
There's lots of chicks that
come in and out of here.

1041
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:17,534
I've been in the buildings across the street.
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

1042
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:20,454
Look, lady, it's cold as a witch's tit.
We're going inside.

1043
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:22,206
May I?

1044
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,208
Door's always open, man.

1045
00:58:51,252 --> 00:58:52,803
<i>Hey, I got the pork butt</i>

1046
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:54,805
<i>and I lifted a bunch of onions.</i>

1047
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:37,314
Sandy?

1048
00:59:41,236 --> 00:59:43,020
Sandy?

1049
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,876
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

1050
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:56,834
I'm sorry to bother you again,

1051
00:59:56,868 --> 00:59:59,870
but this violin,
this belongs to the girl

1052
00:59:59,904 --> 01:00:02,039
I was talking about. Are you
sure you haven't seen her?

1053
01:00:02,073 --> 01:00:04,675
Look, lady, I don't want to have
to lay the regular rap on you,

1054
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:06,660
but I am exhausted
from telling people like you

1055
01:00:06,694 --> 01:00:09,146
- I haven't seen people like her.
- But she was here.

1056
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:11,081
I haven't seen your daughter.

1057
01:00:11,116 --> 01:00:12,950
She's not my daughter.

1058
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,385
So, what are you,
some kind of social worker?

1059
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,121
Her violin teacher?

1060
01:00:19,808 --> 01:00:22,592
Shit.
What's her name?

1061
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,694
Sandy.

1062
01:00:23,728 --> 01:00:26,563
Hey, anybody seen Sandy?

1063
01:00:26,597 --> 01:00:28,699
Do you know how
to make goulash?

1064
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:30,801
'Cause I've got pork butt,
two onions, and lentils

1065
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,569
which I think is what's in it.

1066
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:34,271
Hey, Moon, turn around.

1067
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,409
And paprika.
I know that's in it.

1068
01:00:40,912 --> 01:00:42,679
Well, for one thing,
you'll need a pot.

1069
01:00:42,714 --> 01:00:44,715
We got a pot.

1070
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,885
You'll have to wash it out.

1071
01:00:47,919 --> 01:00:49,553
There's no water.

1072
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:51,455
Really?

1073
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:53,490
We used to use the hose
at the Episcopal church,

1074
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,542
but now the pipes are frozen.

1075
01:00:55,577 --> 01:00:57,795
It was great here all summer.
It was hot.

1076
01:00:57,829 --> 01:01:00,731
So much rather be hot
than cold.

1077
01:01:00,765 --> 01:01:02,566
I'll go on the roof
and get a chunk of snow.

1078
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,936
- Oh, you'll get sick.
- We do it all the time.

1079
01:01:07,772 --> 01:01:10,407
My mom makes great goulash.

1080
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:13,377
- Where are you from?
- Everywhere.

1081
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:15,112
Hold on.

1082
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:16,864
I think there's
an army knife by the bed.

1083
01:01:23,273 --> 01:01:25,140
Hello?

1084
01:01:28,512 --> 01:01:29,812
Your mother still here?

1085
01:01:29,846 --> 01:01:31,647
No. She left.

1086
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:33,816
I'm just waiting for them
to wrap up the deli.

1087
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,551
Where's Skeezix?

1088
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:37,570
Brooks took him bike riding.

1089
01:01:37,604 --> 01:01:39,071
It's kind of cold out there.

1090
01:01:39,105 --> 01:01:40,890
He can't tell the difference.

1091
01:01:40,924 --> 01:01:43,125
The other day
he walked in singing

1092
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,694
and I looked
and his nose was bleeding.

1093
01:01:45,729 --> 01:01:48,063
He didn't know how he did it.

1094
01:01:48,098 --> 01:01:49,698
So he's tough.

1095
01:01:52,302 --> 01:01:54,770
Listen, I want you
to have something.

1096
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:08,817
This was your grandmother's.

1097
01:02:10,203 --> 01:02:12,504
My dad brought it back for her.

1098
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:15,641
He went everywhere.

1099
01:02:15,675 --> 01:02:18,327
- What is it?
- It's water from the River Jordan.

1100
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,629
I was baptized with it.
So were you.

1101
01:02:20,664 --> 01:02:23,799
We would have used it on Ellery,
but I guess she forgot.

1102
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:25,634
Hope she didn't
put her teeth in it.

1103
01:02:25,669 --> 01:02:29,088
Well, thank you.
It's lovely.

1104
01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:35,744
Did Nana Mimsy
leave me anything else?

1105
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:38,047
I'm afraid she left
everything to the zoo.

1106
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:41,116
She's making them
name the animals.

1107
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,085
I'm sorry.

1108
01:02:43,103 --> 01:02:45,220
That doesn't seem funny to me.

1109
01:02:45,255 --> 01:02:46,922
It does to me.

1110
01:02:46,957 --> 01:02:48,857
Her will looked like
the manifest from Noah's ark.

1111
01:02:48,892 --> 01:02:51,393
Well, it's different for you.

1112
01:02:51,428 --> 01:02:53,596
Brooks didn't start
off where you did.

1113
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:56,215
- He'll get there.
- Oh, I know he will.

1114
01:02:56,266 --> 01:02:58,834
It's just
that there's--

1115
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,377
well, Daddy, there's
this opportunity.

1116
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:10,879
I don't know, I--

1117
01:03:10,914 --> 01:03:12,348
I told Nana about it,

1118
01:03:12,382 --> 01:03:14,783
but obviously
she didn't understand.

1119
01:03:14,818 --> 01:03:17,653
Were you this specific?

1120
01:03:17,687 --> 01:03:19,755
Daddy, don't.

1121
01:03:19,773 --> 01:03:22,591
It's not good for you.

1122
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:25,260
I worry.

1123
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:30,099
Refrigeration.

1124
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:32,534
It's the wave
of the future, Daddy.

1125
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:35,070
<i>They can transport fruit</i>
<i>all the way from California</i>

1126
01:03:35,105 --> 01:03:37,206
in just four days
and it doesn't go bad.

1127
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,942
Some of these trucks
can carry 20 tons.

1128
01:03:39,976 --> 01:03:42,177
And, of course, you're
buying the technology

1129
01:03:42,212 --> 01:03:45,047
for the refrigerated trucks, so it
doesn't matter what they get used for.

1130
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:47,916
It's really not
Brooks' problem.

1131
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:51,854
Well, I guess you should have
Brooks talk to me about it.

1132
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:53,522
Of course.

1133
01:03:53,556 --> 01:03:55,824
I know he'd like to
make it on his own, but--

1134
01:03:55,859 --> 01:03:57,459
I'd have to see
something on paper.

1135
01:03:57,494 --> 01:03:58,994
Oh, he's got that, believe me.

1136
01:03:59,029 --> 01:04:03,365
Well, good.

1137
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,134
And I'm glad
we had this little chat.

1138
01:04:05,168 --> 01:04:07,135
Oh, Daddy.

1139
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:15,644
I'm going to go see if
they're done in the kitchen.

1140
01:04:25,055 --> 01:04:27,222
<i>Don?</i>

1141
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,359
Don?

1142
01:04:30,393 --> 01:04:33,996
Did you make it
to the memorial?

1143
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,082
Except for the mess, you're
exactly where I left you.

1144
01:04:37,117 --> 01:04:40,169
I put in an appearance.
I just should have had lunch.

1145
01:04:40,203 --> 01:04:41,703
Aspirin?

1146
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:44,723
I'm better now.
You?

1147
01:04:44,758 --> 01:04:47,810
Well, I pushed Derek's
mother down the stairs.

1148
01:04:47,844 --> 01:04:50,179
- Did you?
- I did.

1149
01:04:50,213 --> 01:04:53,182
They wanted me to radiate evil,
so I looked her in the eyes,

1150
01:04:53,216 --> 01:04:54,783
but I don't know
how close the camera was

1151
01:04:54,818 --> 01:04:56,819
because it was
a stuntman in a dress.

1152
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:58,987
Don't worry. I don't think there's
a nice way you can do that.

1153
01:04:59,022 --> 01:05:02,124
I'm not sure people will want
my autograph anymore.

1154
01:05:02,158 --> 01:05:03,459
Yes, they will.

1155
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:05,327
So you'll still love me

1156
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:07,763
even if I'm a lying,
cheating whore?

1157
01:05:07,797 --> 01:05:10,566
But I'm gonna walk
behind you on the stairs.

1158
01:05:12,786 --> 01:05:15,771
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
make you dinner.

1159
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:19,441
Oh, Rosa found this
in the garbage.

1160
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:22,911
I think she was afraid
you'd think she was stealing.

1161
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,998
<i>Sleep.</i>
<i>I'll come get you.</i>

1162
01:05:38,595 --> 01:05:40,562
<i>Hey, Danny, where'd
you take that joint?</i>

1163
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:43,632
There's three fucking rooms.
Where do you think I am?

1164
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,103
No, thank you.

1165
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,540
Is marijuana expensive?

1166
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:52,941
Do I have to stir it again?

1167
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:55,377
- Is it boiling?
- No.

1168
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:58,497
- My coat smells like onions.
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

1169
01:05:58,531 --> 01:06:01,283
You better tell him you did the cooking, man.
It's your job.

1170
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:02,785
It's my bag.

1171
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:08,423
- It smells good.
- I made goulash.

1172
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:11,126
- Did you get Wonder Bread?
- We got batteries.

1173
01:06:11,161 --> 01:06:13,262
Hey, Zal, did you make
any friends today?

1174
01:06:13,296 --> 01:06:15,497
Did you run into this chick?
What's her name?

1175
01:06:17,367 --> 01:06:20,468
I'm sorry.
This violin belongs

1176
01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:22,371
to my friend Sandy. Do you
know when she'll be back?

1177
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:24,540
Sorry, Blondie, but that
violin belongs to me.

1178
01:06:24,574 --> 01:06:28,076
No, I know the girl who plays this
violin and I'm looking for her.

1179
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:34,416
Yeah, no, I saw her.
She sold it to me.

1180
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,685
She's trying to get enough
bread to go to California.

1181
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:38,020
Says it's too cold.

1182
01:06:39,656 --> 01:06:41,156
So where is she now?

1183
01:06:41,191 --> 01:06:44,109
- Does she owe you money?
- No.

1184
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,095
Well, your daughter's long gone,
Blondie, so why don't you run along?

1185
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,898
- Come on, Zal.
- Why are you being so rude?

1186
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:53,068
Why can't you leave her be?
Kills you to be out of control.

1187
01:06:53,102 --> 01:06:55,304
Well, someone needs
to control this mess.

1188
01:06:55,338 --> 01:06:57,539
Lady, we have to take everything
the Establishment throws away.

1189
01:06:57,574 --> 01:06:59,174
That's all that's left.

1190
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:01,176
What you can't grok
is that we are your garbage.

1191
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:03,378
You don't want this house,
you don't want us.

1192
01:07:03,413 --> 01:07:05,547
You're not allowed
to ask anybody to leave.

1193
01:07:05,582 --> 01:07:07,149
The bylaws say
if someone is a nuisance

1194
01:07:07,183 --> 01:07:09,084
or a narc,
that shall not be observed.

1195
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:11,987
I'm obviously not
the people you're talking about.

1196
01:07:12,021 --> 01:07:14,690
I came here because I'm looking
for someone that I do want.

1197
01:07:14,724 --> 01:07:16,358
I did not throw her away.

1198
01:07:16,392 --> 01:07:18,310
Yeah, you're a goodie.
I can tell.

1199
01:07:22,899 --> 01:07:24,867
Look at this.
She's got 80 bucks.

1200
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:28,537
- Can I have it?
- No. That's all they care about.

1201
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:32,174
Well, Miss Elizabeth
Hofstadt Francis

1202
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,775
of Rye, New York,

1203
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:37,012
eyes blue, hair bottled,

1204
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:39,882
we don't like your life
any more than you do.

1205
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:43,652
You have bad manners.

1206
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:46,388
You deserve to live in
the street of this pigsty,

1207
01:07:46,406 --> 01:07:49,958
and I hope you get tetanus or crabs or
whatever else is crawling around here.

1208
01:07:49,993 --> 01:07:51,743
Hey, that's my violin.

1209
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:55,197
She sold it?
I don't believe you.

1210
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:57,065
You want it? I'll give
it to you for 10.

1211
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,901
What are you going
to do with a violin?

1212
01:07:58,935 --> 01:08:00,369
Gonna learn how to play it.

1213
01:08:00,403 --> 01:08:02,220
Because it's so easy.

1214
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,995
There's a meatball, which
is probably cold by now,

1215
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:39,666
and an Italian, which is
probably even colder.

1216
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:44,637
You're typing a lot.
You got a new way to go?

1217
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:46,840
No, I'm doing this thing
Don used to do.

1218
01:08:46,891 --> 01:08:49,559
I'm writing a letter
to a fictitious acquaintance

1219
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:51,928
telling her how great
my new headphones are.

1220
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,930
Well, I hate that
it gives you extra work,

1221
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:56,316
but I think it's about time

1222
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:59,102
this unjust war is finally
having an impact on commerce.

1223
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:00,970
Meatball.

1224
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,157
- Did we order dinner?
- No.

1225
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:06,326
I can share.

1226
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,579
Try the headphones again.
Try and think of some words.

1227
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:14,284
- What have you got?
- We have three very different angles.

1228
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:16,452
<i>If you dip the audio</i>
<i>in the wide shot,</i>

1229
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,004
Mark Antony is just, you know,

1230
01:09:18,038 --> 01:09:20,290
mouthing the "lend me
your ears" part.

1231
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,458
You hear the announcer say
one of these things--

1232
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:26,012
One. "Are you ready for
the sound for the ages?"

1233
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:30,300
Two. "Koss knows that
good sound is timeless."

1234
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,501
Or "Ladies and gentlemen,

1235
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,838
this is not your
old-fashioned sound."

1236
01:09:35,856 --> 01:09:37,974
What's the next one?

1237
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:41,144
- The next one or the second one?
- You said you had three.

1238
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:43,229
Those were three.
Didn't I read all of them?

1239
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,681
Those are three different
versions of the same idea.

1240
01:09:45,699 --> 01:09:48,351
If you can't tell the difference
between which part's the idea

1241
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:51,037
and which part's the execution of
the idea, you're of no use to me.

1242
01:09:51,071 --> 01:09:52,822
I know what you're doing.
I've been you.

1243
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,541
You're hoping this
sparks my imagination

1244
01:09:54,575 --> 01:09:55,992
and then you can say,
"Wow, she's a genius,"

1245
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:58,244
or say anything because
you want to go home.

1246
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,330
I think they're very
different from each other.

1247
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:01,864
Well, I'm sorry
to point it out,

1248
01:10:01,882 --> 01:10:03,750
but you're walking
over the same ground.

1249
01:10:03,801 --> 01:10:06,369
When you bring me something like
this, it looks like cowardice.

1250
01:10:06,387 --> 01:10:09,205
Here, you can split this
'cause you're not going home.

1251
01:10:14,762 --> 01:10:16,062
What do you think?

1252
01:10:16,096 --> 01:10:17,647
What?

1253
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:24,020
- How do they sound?
- Scared. You were a little rough.

1254
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:26,272
No, the headphones.
Don't worry about them.

1255
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,691
Some workers
don't respond to that.

1256
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,394
Look, Abe, I don't need
another negative voice.

1257
01:10:31,412 --> 01:10:33,746
And those, quote, "workers" aren't
surprised that I'm frustrated

1258
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:35,281
because they know
that they're lazy.

1259
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,617
Sorry. I didn't know
what kind of abuse

1260
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,202
was required
to get into the frat.

1261
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:41,838
Listen to your music, kid.

1262
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:14,570
Because you laughed at him.

1263
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,772
Yes, they like that.

1264
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:18,491
Hello.

1265
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:30,887
Where you been?

1266
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,008
I had some errands to run.

1267
01:11:36,844 --> 01:11:39,312
Well, I know what somebody's
getting next Christmas.

1268
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,351
Did you eat?

1269
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:47,320
Chicken salad.

1270
01:11:47,354 --> 01:11:50,907
That's a relief,
because my feet are frozen.

1271
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:01,150
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

1272
01:12:01,168 --> 01:12:03,002
Morning.
How are we today?

1273
01:12:03,037 --> 01:12:05,288
- Fine, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1274
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:07,507
Seeing as how you
were under the weather,

1275
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:10,626
I just wanted to remind you about
Jules and Terry from Sheraton later.

1276
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,178
Cancel.

1277
01:12:12,212 --> 01:12:13,880
Their bosses are coming
back next week

1278
01:12:13,931 --> 01:12:16,382
and they just sent you
on a very expensive trip.

1279
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:21,637
Would you get Stan in here?

1280
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,222
Oh, listen.

1281
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:25,975
I got this by mistake.
It belongs to some private.

1282
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,361
See if you can find out some
way to get it to his division.

1283
01:12:28,395 --> 01:12:30,530
I will. Do you want
to enclose a note?

1284
01:12:30,564 --> 01:12:34,233
Nah. I found it
on a barstool.

1285
01:12:34,284 --> 01:12:36,352
I mean, you've got to be
on my side here, right?

1286
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:40,323
First my ex-wife works the body
with a brutal guilt attack

1287
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:43,192
and then my daughter works
the wallet like a speed bag.

1288
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:44,877
<i>You want me on your side?</i>

1289
01:12:44,912 --> 01:12:48,164
- You have kids?
- We're not talking about me.

1290
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,199
You know, I used
to jump off mountains.

1291
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:53,702
It never occurred to me
I had this invisible parachute.

1292
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:56,756
My mother loved me in some
completely pointless way

1293
01:12:56,807 --> 01:12:59,425
and it's gone.
So there it is.

1294
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:02,895
She gave me my last
new experience.

1295
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:05,681
And now I know that
all I'm going to be doing

1296
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:08,551
from here on
is losing everything.

1297
01:13:08,569 --> 01:13:11,104
You feel loss.

1298
01:13:11,155 --> 01:13:12,855
Damn it, how many times
do I have to say this?

1299
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,524
I don't feel anything.

1300
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,109
I'm just acknowledging
that life,

1301
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,911
unlike this analysis,
will eventually end

1302
01:13:18,946 --> 01:13:21,564
and somebody else
will get the bill.

1303
01:13:28,088 --> 01:13:30,339
- Good morning, Ken.
- Good morning, Bob.

1304
01:13:34,795 --> 01:13:36,712
What are you doing out here?

1305
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,414
You have a meeting
with someone important?

1306
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:40,550
No, but are you looking for me?

1307
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:43,752
I'll drop everything. I just came
out here to enjoy the light.

1308
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:45,288
Oh, I thought maybe
you were out here

1309
01:13:45,322 --> 01:13:47,090
greeting customers
for your catering business.

1310
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,979
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly.

1311
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:57,116
I'm sorry,
are you cross with me?

1312
01:13:57,151 --> 01:13:59,118
Someone sent a royal spread
to Sterling's.

1313
01:13:59,153 --> 01:14:00,820
It had a card on it
with your name.

1314
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,790
Oh, that. It just
seemed the thing to do.

1315
01:14:03,824 --> 01:14:05,774
Well, it was too much.

1316
01:14:05,793 --> 01:14:08,578
It was almost like you were
invited, but you weren't.

1317
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:12,165
I guess I was just remembering
when my father died.

1318
01:14:12,216 --> 01:14:14,617
Any gesture
meant something to me.

1319
01:14:14,635 --> 01:14:16,669
There wasn't supposed
to be a card.

1320
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,456
Okay.

1321
01:14:20,474 --> 01:14:22,842
Well, take your work
and go back to your office.

1322
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:25,144
Sitting out here makes people
think you have nothing to do,

1323
01:14:25,179 --> 01:14:27,630
and I suspect you're
hoping it's the opposite.

1324
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,475
I guess it's time to catch up
on my phone calls.

1325
01:14:43,363 --> 01:14:46,532
Look, we're sorry we had to squeeze
in this meeting between the holidays.

1326
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:49,152
We're obviously not expecting
a full presentation.

1327
01:14:49,186 --> 01:14:51,487
Well, I can say
with all honesty that Don

1328
01:14:51,522 --> 01:14:54,323
has not stopped talking about
your incredible property.

1329
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:57,560
I never stayed at the Royal, but
I shipped out of Pearl in 1943

1330
01:14:57,594 --> 01:15:00,530
and, I've got to say, I can
still smell the gardenias.

1331
01:15:00,564 --> 01:15:03,566
Thank you for that.
Don?

1332
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,386
So, Bob Grange and his
delightful wife Patty

1333
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:09,838
saw to our every need
and also missed no opportunity

1334
01:15:09,857 --> 01:15:12,191
to expose us
to the unique local flavor.

1335
01:15:12,226 --> 01:15:14,477
Lucky Bob.
I tried to get that job,

1336
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:17,029
but unfortunately
I got promoted.

1337
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:20,199
Well, I've just come back

1338
01:15:20,234 --> 01:15:22,851
and I'm not sure how much
I've talked about it,

1339
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:26,072
but there is a feeling
that's stayed with me.

1340
01:15:26,123 --> 01:15:28,023
I've been in the winter.

1341
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:30,076
It's quite a shock coming back.

1342
01:15:30,127 --> 01:15:33,329
Well put. But that
could be any vacation.

1343
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:35,864
This was very, very different.

1344
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:40,503
I think we're not selling
a geographical location.

1345
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:42,505
We're selling an experience.

1346
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,840
It's not just
a different place,

1347
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,176
you are different.

1348
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,729
And you'd think there'd be
an unsettling feeling

1349
01:15:49,763 --> 01:15:52,265
about something so drastically
different, but there's something else.

1350
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:58,721
You don't miss anything.
You're not homesick.

1351
01:15:58,739 --> 01:16:01,857
It puts you in this state.

1352
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,943
The air and the water

1353
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:06,078
are all the same
temperature as your body.

1354
01:16:06,113 --> 01:16:08,915
It's sensory--
the music, the fragrance,

1355
01:16:08,949 --> 01:16:11,667
the breeze, and the blue.
Stan.

1356
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:14,921
Ahem.

1357
01:16:14,955 --> 01:16:16,956
It's just a sketch.

1358
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:19,575
<i>Hawaiian legend
has it that the soul</i>

1359
01:16:19,593 --> 01:16:21,744
can go in and out of the body,

1360
01:16:21,762 --> 01:16:26,248
but that it usually leaves from
a leeward point into the waves.

1361
01:16:26,266 --> 01:16:29,769
"Hawaii.
The jumping off point."

1362
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:38,261
So what happened to him?

1363
01:16:38,295 --> 01:16:40,613
He got off the plane,
took a deep breath,

1364
01:16:40,647 --> 01:16:44,600
shed his skin, and jumped off.

1365
01:16:44,618 --> 01:16:46,819
I assume this is a photograph.

1366
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,455
More color.
That water is transparent.

1367
01:16:49,489 --> 01:16:52,608
Well, I suppose it reminds
me a little of the cinema.

1368
01:16:54,127 --> 01:16:56,462
But mostly I see James Mason

1369
01:16:56,496 --> 01:16:59,799
- at the end of that movie walking
into the sea. - What is that movie?

1370
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:01,617
I'm not sure I know
what you're taking about.

1371
01:17:01,635 --> 01:17:04,303
He's killing himself.
I don't think they show it,

1372
01:17:04,338 --> 01:17:06,973
but he's going to swim out
until he can't swim back.

1373
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:12,595
That may be a personal
association for you,

1374
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,296
but that's not what this means.

1375
01:17:14,314 --> 01:17:17,132
We looked at this. None
of us thought of that.

1376
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:19,635
"A Star is Born."

1377
01:17:19,653 --> 01:17:23,105
The copy is all about
the Hawaiian legend.

1378
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,775
Aloha means hello and goodbye.

1379
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:28,327
I'm sorry, but this
is very poetic.

1380
01:17:28,362 --> 01:17:30,780
- Thank you.
- Where's our hotel?

1381
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:34,367
Where's the Pink Palace
and Diamond Head?

1382
01:17:34,418 --> 01:17:36,202
You got to have
Diamond Head in the shot.

1383
01:17:36,253 --> 01:17:37,837
Anyone can do that.

1384
01:17:39,506 --> 01:17:41,040
I don't agree.

1385
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:47,847
Well, there's no reason we can't
tilt the camera up 45 degrees

1386
01:17:47,881 --> 01:17:50,800
and see the husk of our
city dweller on the sand

1387
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:54,387
and an arm of the hotel and
Diamond Head in the background.

1388
01:17:54,438 --> 01:17:56,639
So there would be a man
in this photo

1389
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:58,224
and he most likely
would be naked?

1390
01:17:58,275 --> 01:18:01,176
Actually, my first thought
is there is no man.

1391
01:18:01,194 --> 01:18:04,397
Just his footprints.
What happened to him?

1392
01:18:04,448 --> 01:18:07,700
I think, and I think
people might think,

1393
01:18:07,734 --> 01:18:09,852
that he died.

1394
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:11,687
Maybe he did
and he went to heaven.

1395
01:18:11,705 --> 01:18:14,523
Maybe that's what
this feels like.

1396
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:17,660
- It's a little morbid.
- Well, heaven's a little morbid.

1397
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:20,195
How do you get to heaven?
Something terrible has to happen.

1398
01:18:21,548 --> 01:18:23,833
We don't want that in the ad.

1399
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:27,253
Of course there's
no doubt this concept itself

1400
01:18:27,304 --> 01:18:30,038
is merely a jumping
off the point.

1401
01:18:30,057 --> 01:18:32,925
A picture of a hotel,
even yours,

1402
01:18:32,976 --> 01:18:34,710
is easy to ignore.

1403
01:18:34,728 --> 01:18:38,097
This, or some version of this,
demands your attention.

1404
01:18:38,148 --> 01:18:40,566
Well, you will continue
to have our attention.

1405
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,102
Make no mistake, we're not
afraid of provocative.

1406
01:18:46,406 --> 01:18:49,608
So is there any time left for
holiday plans for either of you?

1407
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:51,777
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- You as well.

1408
01:18:54,331 --> 01:18:55,865
What's the matter? You didn't
get all your vomiting done

1409
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,083
at my mother's funeral?

1410
01:18:57,117 --> 01:18:58,951
Roger, I apologize.
I had a bug.

1411
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:01,087
Yeah, well, you didn't
miss anything.

1412
01:19:01,121 --> 01:19:02,755
Does that make you
think of suicide?

1413
01:19:02,789 --> 01:19:04,256
Of course.

1414
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:06,092
That's what's so great
about it.

1415
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:13,299
You know, we sold actual death

1416
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,718
for 25 years with Lucky Strike.

1417
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:19,138
You know how we did it?
We ignored it.

1418
01:19:33,976 --> 01:19:35,510
Hold on.

1419
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:37,245
Can I go to Becky's
for New Year's Eve?

1420
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:39,647
- Talk to your mother.
- Can't you get a sitter?

1421
01:19:39,682 --> 01:19:42,784
Have your friend come here. You can
bang pots and pans at midnight.

1422
01:19:42,818 --> 01:19:45,136
It's a party. They can't
bring the whole party here.

1423
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:47,955
I'll stay until 9:00.
I'll put them to bed.

1424
01:19:47,973 --> 01:19:49,507
<i>Hello.</i>

1425
01:19:49,558 --> 01:19:52,060
Ask your mother.
We're in here.

1426
01:19:57,299 --> 01:19:59,484
So?

1427
01:19:59,518 --> 01:20:01,486
Anything new?

1428
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,489
I hate it.
You're ugly.

1429
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,977
What happened to you?

1430
01:20:11,163 --> 01:20:12,830
So?

1431
01:20:15,417 --> 01:20:18,119
Elizabeth Taylor,

1432
01:20:18,153 --> 01:20:20,321
what have you done
with my wife?

1433
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,512
You're free until lunch, but I
have to tell you something.

1434
01:20:27,546 --> 01:20:29,130
Just a minute.
What's that?

1435
01:20:29,164 --> 01:20:31,832
More bad news.
Giorgio died.

1436
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:33,968
His family sent over
his shoeshine kit

1437
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:35,853
because you were the only
one who called about him.

1438
01:20:35,888 --> 01:20:37,355
What happened to him?

1439
01:20:37,389 --> 01:20:39,273
I didn't ask.

1440
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:29,607
So the secret is to rub the
pot with a clove of garlic

1441
01:21:29,658 --> 01:21:31,359
and then add twice
the kirschwasser.

1442
01:21:31,393 --> 01:21:34,829
How wonderful that we can
just stagger downstairs.

1443
01:21:36,832 --> 01:21:39,400
I might just get undressed
in the elevator.

1444
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:41,786
I don't know if I can
make it to midnight,

1445
01:21:41,837 --> 01:21:44,705
but I do know we're not leaving
here until those kids are in bed.

1446
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:46,591
It's a beautiful fondue pot.

1447
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:48,576
- Where'd you get it?
- Bloomingdales.

1448
01:21:48,594 --> 01:21:50,711
The kitchen store. They have
everything you could think of.

1449
01:21:50,745 --> 01:21:53,965
Not everything.
Tell the story.

1450
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:57,802
Well, there's a guy
in my office.

1451
01:21:57,853 --> 01:22:01,639
He's very <i>flamboyant</i>
and he got arrested there.

1452
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:04,225
- Shoplifting?
- No.

1453
01:22:04,259 --> 01:22:06,310
But he was caught
red-handed.

1454
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:08,780
Apparently the men's room

1455
01:22:08,814 --> 01:22:11,816
is a locale for a certain
kind of assignation

1456
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:14,952
and the store detective's always going
in there and looking under the stall.

1457
01:22:14,987 --> 01:22:18,072
So, my regional sales manager

1458
01:22:18,106 --> 01:22:20,575
apparently takes
two shopping bags,

1459
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:22,443
puts his feet in them

1460
01:22:22,461 --> 01:22:24,829
while the love of his
life sat on the john.

1461
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,081
That is clever.

1462
01:22:27,115 --> 01:22:29,884
How the hell did he get caught?

1463
01:22:30,952 --> 01:22:32,786
How old are your children?

1464
01:22:34,173 --> 01:22:36,841
Um, 11 and seven.

1465
01:22:36,892 --> 01:22:39,477
Well, I might go
kiss them good night.

1466
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:41,512
Ours is a freshman at Michigan.

1467
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:45,016
- He didn't even come home.
- Oh, I'm not ready for that.

1468
01:22:45,067 --> 01:22:46,984
The house feels empty.

1469
01:22:47,019 --> 01:22:48,686
Then you get a phone bill.

1470
01:22:50,522 --> 01:22:53,024
Well, if everybody's
had enough cheese,

1471
01:22:53,075 --> 01:22:55,142
I'm gonna switch to chocolate.

1472
01:22:55,160 --> 01:23:00,031
But first, because it looks
like it's snowing,

1473
01:23:00,082 --> 01:23:03,784
I think it's time
we all took a trip to Hawaii.

1474
01:23:03,818 --> 01:23:06,204
We're having such a good time.

1475
01:23:07,322 --> 01:23:08,822
It's all set up.

1476
01:23:08,841 --> 01:23:10,991
I want to go to Hawaii.

1477
01:23:30,395 --> 01:23:32,196
- Oh!
- Ooh.

1478
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:34,348
- Isn't it incredible?
- Yeah.

1479
01:23:47,362 --> 01:23:49,697
<i>Oh, let me explain.</i>

1480
01:23:49,715 --> 01:23:53,033
I woke up in the morning
and Don was at a wedding

1481
01:23:53,051 --> 01:23:54,719
giving away the bride.

1482
01:23:54,753 --> 01:23:56,554
That's romantic.

1483
01:23:56,588 --> 01:23:58,256
How did that happen?

1484
01:24:02,928 --> 01:24:05,346
So, of course,
Kreutzer's yelling

1485
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,433
and Ginsberg says, "I'm sorry, but
what the hell do I know about ham?"

1486
01:24:11,553 --> 01:24:14,054
How could they let him near clients?
Haven't they learned?

1487
01:24:14,072 --> 01:24:17,909
Hey, do you think Joan and Roger
are still sleeping together?

1488
01:24:17,943 --> 01:24:19,694
Because his mother croaked

1489
01:24:19,728 --> 01:24:21,913
and she completely ignored him.

1490
01:24:21,947 --> 01:24:24,699
I don't know. We don't even know
if that really ever happened.

1491
01:24:24,733 --> 01:24:27,285
I've got pictures in my head.

1492
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:29,704
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.

1493
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:31,339
- You want some?
- Very funny.

1494
01:24:31,373 --> 01:24:33,040
Hey, I'm not hanging up.

1495
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:37,911
<i>Happy New Year.</i>

1496
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:41,248
Ted. What are you
doing here?

1497
01:24:41,266 --> 01:24:44,101
I heard there were four people
in the office on New Year's Eve.

1498
01:24:44,136 --> 01:24:46,387
I figured I owed it to the
team to at least stop by.

1499
01:24:46,421 --> 01:24:48,556
Oh, I'm just--

1500
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:51,925
there's a--
did you get my message?

1501
01:24:51,944 --> 01:24:54,895
I received them all.
And I apologize,

1502
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:57,481
but it was sort of a
retreat for my wife and I

1503
01:24:57,532 --> 01:25:00,267
and, well, apparently
I work too much.

1504
01:25:00,285 --> 01:25:03,237
Well, you know the problem.

1505
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:05,406
Yes.
Any solutions?

1506
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,124
There's one.

1507
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:09,160
I found this thing.

1508
01:25:10,629 --> 01:25:12,797
- What is this?
- It's an outtake.

1509
01:25:12,831 --> 01:25:16,550
He had his headset on
and was clowning around.

1510
01:25:18,136 --> 01:25:19,620
There's two minutes of it.

1511
01:25:22,891 --> 01:25:25,760
Look at this guy.
What a pain in the ass.

1512
01:25:25,794 --> 01:25:28,312
I was irritated
about it on the day,

1513
01:25:28,347 --> 01:25:31,098
but now I'm a little excited.

1514
01:25:31,132 --> 01:25:33,985
I think you can show him
making these faces,

1515
01:25:34,019 --> 01:25:36,970
with no music,
and say something like,

1516
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:40,608
"Koss Headphones
sound so sharp and clear,

1517
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:43,361
you can actually see it."

1518
01:25:45,914 --> 01:25:49,700
It always takes a crisis
to sell work this good.

1519
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:51,151
You think it's good?

1520
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:53,320
Makes me smile
more than the original.

1521
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:58,676
- Do you want to see the new voice-over?
- No.

1522
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:01,012
Well, I hope
I didn't ruin your evening.

1523
01:26:01,046 --> 01:26:04,632
Not mine, but there's people working
out there, Peggy. It's New Year's Eve.

1524
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:07,051
If you knew you had something,
you should have let them go.

1525
01:26:07,102 --> 01:26:10,304
- They know they can go.
- No, they don't.

1526
01:26:10,338 --> 01:26:12,356
Oh.

1527
01:26:14,726 --> 01:26:17,194
You're good in a crisis.

1528
01:26:19,614 --> 01:26:21,198
Thank you.

1529
01:26:21,233 --> 01:26:23,567
Happy New Year.

1530
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,074
<i>He likes you.</i>

1531
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,910
What did you hear?

1532
01:26:32,961 --> 01:26:34,361
All of it.

1533
01:26:41,091 --> 01:26:43,259
This is Galliano.

1534
01:26:43,293 --> 01:26:45,228
It's from Jonesy.

1535
01:26:45,262 --> 01:26:47,864
I'm glad he's giving
presents to someone else.

1536
01:26:47,898 --> 01:26:49,732
I can't stand
the constant bootlicking.

1537
01:26:49,767 --> 01:26:51,334
He's grateful.

1538
01:26:53,303 --> 01:26:55,555
- <i>Cent'anni.</i>
- What does that mean?

1539
01:26:55,589 --> 01:26:57,673
It's Italian for <i>l'chaim.</i>

1540
01:26:57,707 --> 01:26:59,892
It means "100 years."

1541
01:27:05,065 --> 01:27:07,049
What do you think
Dave paid for their place?

1542
01:27:07,067 --> 01:27:09,051
Arnold, don't.

1543
01:27:09,069 --> 01:27:11,554
Fine.
Don, what did you pay?

1544
01:27:11,572 --> 01:27:13,940
75.

1545
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:16,392
Well, you're a floor
higher than us.

1546
01:27:16,443 --> 01:27:19,779
Jesus.
Syl, did you hear that?

1547
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:21,364
Happy New Year.

1548
01:27:24,752 --> 01:27:27,837
We missed midnight.
It's 1:00.

1549
01:27:27,871 --> 01:27:30,006
We missed it.

1550
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,041
It's probably my mother.

1551
01:27:32,075 --> 01:27:33,459
Or Dave and Cathy.

1552
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:35,962
Face down in the hall.

1553
01:27:36,013 --> 01:27:37,346
Hello?

1554
01:27:39,383 --> 01:27:42,685
Um, Arnie, it's the service.

1555
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,971
Thank you.

1556
01:27:45,022 --> 01:27:46,022
Hello?

1557
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:49,758
Okay.

1558
01:27:53,363 --> 01:27:55,731
All right, tell them
I'm on my way.

1559
01:27:58,285 --> 01:27:59,602
I've got to go.

1560
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,042
I need cigarettes.
I'll walk you down.

1561
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:08,828
It's 1:00 a.m.
in a snowstorm

1562
01:28:08,879 --> 01:28:10,746
on a holiday on a Sunday.

1563
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,331
You are never gonna get a cab.

1564
01:28:12,382 --> 01:28:15,117
Don't even try
to talk him out of it.

1565
01:28:28,798 --> 01:28:31,734
- These them?
- Yeah, you see the boots?

1566
01:28:40,911 --> 01:28:43,579
What is it like to have
someone's life in your hands?

1567
01:28:45,282 --> 01:28:48,534
Well, it's a privilege
and an honor

1568
01:28:48,585 --> 01:28:50,953
to be trusted with
that responsibility.

1569
01:28:53,924 --> 01:28:55,341
There they are.

1570
01:29:03,967 --> 01:29:05,468
Look at that.

1571
01:29:05,502 --> 01:29:08,054
Time to quit smoking.

1572
01:29:08,105 --> 01:29:10,439
It's a good resolution.

1573
01:29:10,474 --> 01:29:12,808
Well...

1574
01:29:12,842 --> 01:29:14,810
that's one lucky patient.

1575
01:29:14,844 --> 01:29:17,563
Honestly, Don, the whole
life-and-death thing,

1576
01:29:17,614 --> 01:29:20,683
it doesn't bother me.
It never has.

1577
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:23,119
Guys like us,
that's why we get paid.

1578
01:29:23,153 --> 01:29:25,454
- Us?
- Fine.

1579
01:29:25,489 --> 01:29:27,690
You get paid to think about things
they don't want to think about

1580
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:30,859
and I get paid
to not think about them.

1581
01:29:30,878 --> 01:29:33,713
People will do anything
to alleviate their anxiety.

1582
01:30:31,188 --> 01:30:33,222
Did you read my Dante?

1583
01:30:34,758 --> 01:30:37,059
It made me think of you.

1584
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:42,398
I don't know how to take that.

1585
01:30:44,034 --> 01:30:46,268
It's beautiful.

1586
01:31:16,233 --> 01:31:18,300
What do you want for this year?

1587
01:31:20,237 --> 01:31:22,971
I want to stop doing this.

1588
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:29,111
I know.
