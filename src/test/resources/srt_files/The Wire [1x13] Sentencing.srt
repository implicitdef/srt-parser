1
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,156
Hey, now.

2
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,438
We called earlier, they said you were up...

3
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:38,372
and by the time we get here,
you're back asleep.

4
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:44,545
-Been there long?
-No.

5
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:47,610
20 minutes.

6
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:52,522
You know, we didn't want to
exactly disturb you.

7
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:54,891
I'm bored, is all.

8
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:57,056
Yeah, but still.

9
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:00,121
So, what you got for me?

10
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,295
-Spreads?
-Yeah.

11
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,406
Little Man. For sure.

12
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,274
That's good. Are you able to write?

13
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:29,226
Okay. Number two.

14
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:43,069
I can make Little Man,
because he's in the front...

15
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:46,604
trying to snatch the cash off the dashboard.

16
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,448
But the other one, he's outside in the dark.

17
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:58,586
-So....
-So, you know, it's okay.

18
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:05,456
Is there anyone here that you do recognize?

19
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,556
Sure. Wee-Bey.

20
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:15,663
All right.

21
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:20,504
Let me tell you where we're
coming from with the shooters.

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,475
We tracked their escape route,
and Landsman came up with their hoodies.

23
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,841
Now, DNA matched...

24
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,517
human hair from one of the hoodies
to Wee-Bey.

25
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,551
Freamon, he tracked
a call from the pay phone...

26
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:36,219
near the scene, to Stringer Bell's pager.

27
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:39,057
Now, the caller was
using Bey's beeper code.

28
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:43,024
Crime lab, they lift a print...

29
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:46,636
off a soda can near that phone,
and that matches Little Man.

30
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:51,671
You know, so, you know, I'm saying....

31
00:02:58,284 --> 00:03:01,117
Okay, hear me out.

32
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:03,481
There's a downside here.

33
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,183
We don't have the guns...

34
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,594
no prints from the scene, no witnesses.

35
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:15,158
But worse, we're going to be dealing
with a Baltimore city jury...

36
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,701
and a good man is hard to find in this town.

37
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:21,536
Twelve of them together, especially.

38
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:31,074
An ID of both your shooters...

39
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,453
will play a whole lot easier come trial.

40
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:41,984
Yeah.

41
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:47,023
Sometimes things just got to play hard.

42
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,770
We got everyone on our list except C.C.O.

43
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,711
We hit his mama's house...

44
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,941
and she says that he went up
to Wabash for some court date.

45
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:47,485
You can get on the computer
and see if any of the Sheriff's deputies...

46
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,850
can snatch him up in some courtroom.

47
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:54,916
Yeah. No, we got Ronnie Moe.

48
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:57,729
I'm looking at him
go in the jail van right now.

49
00:05:58,831 --> 00:05:59,855
All right.

50
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,962
-Fished our limit. Let's go home.
-"Sir."

51
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,504
-Huh?
-"Let's go home, sir."

52
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,406
You're looking at
a soon-to-be-made sergeant.

53
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:14,311
So what I'm saying is,
when we're around the troops...

54
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:16,973
you got to get used to
showing the proper respect.

55
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:20,279
So, "Let's go home, sir." All right?

56
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,798
What's the count?

57
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,267
So far we've picked up 1 2.
That leaves seven on the wing.

58
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,407
Anything worthwhile?

59
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:49,378
Some phone numbers that match,
scraps of nicknames, not much else.

60
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:50,470
We need something now.

61
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,485
They'll shut us down unless we come up
with something fresh to run with right now.

62
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:57,556
The wires are dead.
The bug in the club is useless.

63
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:00,216
They're moving out of there
even as we got up on them.

64
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,953
-To where?
-No clue.

65
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,655
But they're going to have to set up again.

66
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,160
Either Barksdale moves
to reset his distribution...

67
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,426
or he gives up the towers.

68
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:11,162
-If not Avon, then Stringer.
-And why not Avon?

69
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,200
With no priors, he's out
two hours after the bail review.

70
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:17,499
What we put on Barksdale
barely makes him break stride.

71
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,238
Okay, so we get a hint of
where they're setting back up.

72
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,246
We ask the State's Attorney for a new bug...

73
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:24,077
maybe even a wire if we get onto a phone.

74
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,741
Not while the deputy breathes air.

75
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,752
We'll be reassigned
before you finish typing up your affidavit.

76
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:30,321
How about the feds?

77
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:33,758
You think the Deputy's
going to let you take this mess federal?

78
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,690
Why does the Deputy need to know?

79
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,226
McNulty, you are a piece of work.

80
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:43,926
McNulty.

81
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,138
Yeah?

82
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,037
No shit.

83
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,339
No fucking shit.

84
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:59,083
It's Rhonda Pearlman.

85
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:02,585
She just got a call from an assistant
public defender in North Jersey...

86
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:05,782
who claims to represent
a man by the name of D'Angelo Barksdale.

87
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:09,025
Meet me in Homicide. Bring a tape recorder.

88
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,392
No drug lawyers? No Levy?

89
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,361
-Case got some legs on her, don't she?
-Don't she?

90
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:20,000
Quarter of a million dollars bail.
You believe that shit?

91
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:22,198
It hurts to even show that kind of money.

92
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:27,502
-Where Levy at? He ain't at the club, is he?
-No, club's out. We can't talk there no more.

93
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,510
-Come on, man, let's get out of here.
-What's up, baby?

94
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,050
So, this is it?

95
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,455
Look, before you go anyplace else,
before you talk anyplace else...

96
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,856
we got to think this through.

97
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,156
We're up to almost 20 arrests at last count.

98
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,564
And if you look at the probable cause,
they all read just like yours:

99
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,666
Information from a confidential source.

100
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,365
Don't this seem way too much
for one snitch?

101
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:58,841
I agree. My gut tells me a wire.

102
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:03,404
Either a phone or two,
or maybe something in a room somewhere.

103
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:06,209
Talked to your nephew
on the phone about the Jersey thing?

104
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:08,183
No. Of course not, man. No phones.

105
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:12,417
When I talk to him, I talk to him face-to-face,
in my office, in the back of the club.

106
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:16,152
-Fuck.
-It's good you moved out of there.

107
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,094
I don't know, man.
I mean, if they got a mike up in there...

108
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,428
they got you and me saying all kind of shit.

109
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,261
That reminds me. He said he'd be in tonight.

110
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:30,937
-Thing is, they take you and leave me?
-That's what's fucking me up, too, man.

111
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:34,672
Look, we'll know soon enough,
as soon as I start pressing for discovery.

112
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,248
What do you want to do
about the people they locked up?

113
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:40,250
-We got to pull them.
-That's showing a lot of money.

114
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:43,219
If we don't,
we run the risk of making them enemies.

115
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:45,790
Speaking of which,
where are you with your nephew?

116
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:47,791
Is he going to see the light or what?

117
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,657
Let me tell you something, man.
He family, all right?

118
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:52,090
He not going to buck.

119
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,961
A day or two in the New Jersey bullpen,
he gonna be crying...

120
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,262
waiting for bail money like the rest of them.

121
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:58,393
All right.

122
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:02,470
So, let's run the money through the families,
that'll hide it some.

123
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,569
-And don't use the same bondsman.
-All right.

124
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,372
Look, gentlemen, I know it's early...

125
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,845
I want you to start thinking
about who was charged...

126
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:11,711
and what kind of time they can do.

127
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:15,948
One of the ways to limit your exposure
is what's called a structured plea.

128
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:19,024
That means that you're going to
have to deliver your people...

129
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:21,354
all of them, down to a man.

130
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,224
I saw your girl today, for the idents.

131
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:27,323
How's she doing?

132
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,333
Okay, I guess.

133
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:32,395
She's out of the ICU.

134
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:34,734
Moving slow, but moving, you know?

135
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,870
Jimmy, you ain't been to see her?

136
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:40,740
No. I couldn't go in.

137
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,604
This ain't about you, right?

138
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:47,076
I get back from Jersey, I will.

139
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:51,682
I will.

140
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,655
You know, Cole and me,
we showed her the spreads.

141
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,622
Picked out Little Man, no problem.

142
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,494
Wouldn't go for Wee-Bey.
So, I tried the fat finger.

143
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:04,030
Damn near down on my knees begging her...

144
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:06,730
to make this play easier in court.
You know what she said?

145
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,765
"Sometimes things got to play hard."

146
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,642
Real police.

147
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,073
Oh, yeah.

148
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:27,118
-What the fuck did you do to her?
-I don't know.

149
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:32,556
You two in the same car
going to make for a long-ass drive to Jersey.

150
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:33,957
Shit.

151
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:15,402
Damn, man, it's just too still in here.

152
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:33,153
You know what? We can--

153
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,356
This place will be fine.

154
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:42,456
All we really got to do
is put a little safe in here someplace...

155
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:45,093
and let them know the count
comes here from now on.

156
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,494
Period.

157
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:50,902
Damn, boy, when y'all change up, y'all--

158
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:55,972
Y'all that paranoid?
You ain't even been up in there before.

159
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:58,149
I'm telling you, sis, this shit is different.

160
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,447
We are not going to talk about
nothing indoors. It's a new day.

161
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,322
Thing is, man,
we got to get back on our feet.

162
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:06,414
You know, I mean, the longer we hold off...

163
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,789
the harder it's going to be
to maintain the towers.

164
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:12,193
You want to get it back up,
you lean to me and String here.

165
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,390
-No, I ain't down yet.
-You need to step back.

166
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,093
She's right, bro.
You can't take a second chance here.

167
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:18,736
You know what I'm saying?

168
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:21,362
Until you fixed,
sis going to handle that money...

169
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:23,270
I'm going to handle the products.

170
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,206
-We're here for you.
-All right.

171
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:29,342
But you tell Roberto,
he got to make it a serious smoker.

172
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:31,780
I want them motherfucking fiends
in the projects....

173
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:34,147
I want them dropping like flies.
You feel me?

174
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:37,780
You send out the word,
you let them know we ain't dead yet.

175
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:42,155
-What about my nephew?
-Don't fret.

176
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:46,588
Give me a chance to get with Roberto,
and I'll get up to Dee.

177
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,359
Do what needs doing.

178
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,997
Tell him I'm sorry for putting him
out there like that.

179
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:55,133
And that I'm going to make it up to him.

180
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,935
You going to make it up.

181
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,134
Most def.

182
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,047
But again, I want to make it clear...

183
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:10,451
that all of this cooperation
is contingent on a commitment...

184
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:12,523
that my client finds acceptable.

185
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:13,682
Failing that...

186
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,125
-everything said in here, stays in here.
-Damn straight.

187
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,687
I'm sure a proffer in Maryland
plays much the same in Jersey, counselor.

188
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,857
And I do agree that with regard to matters...

189
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:25,994
involving drug trafficking,
your client has been helpful.

190
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:30,171
He's indicated a willingness to testify
that he was a lieutenant...

191
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:33,039
in Avon Barksdale's
drug distribution organization...

192
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:36,080
sold large quantities of drugs for his uncle.

193
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,775
Delivered money,
attended organizational meetings...

194
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:42,718
and on one occasion made a trip
to New York on the behest of his uncle.

195
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:45,790
All of which corroborates
much of what we already know.

196
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:49,221
What else is there?

197
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:51,127
The murders.

198
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,697
Man, why do you keep on that?

199
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,822
I already told you...

200
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,300
I don't know nothing about
that witness being killed.

201
00:14:58,403 --> 00:14:59,870
Which witness?

202
00:15:01,473 --> 00:15:02,940
Remember her?

203
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:05,033
Jesus.

204
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:09,778
-They did her?
-Yeah, about the same time they did the boy.

205
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:20,791
All of them bodies.

206
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,393
-They covering up, man.
-Yeah, that's what we think.

207
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,333
-No loose ends.
-I can understand the guard.

208
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,705
She got paid, so she had to go.

209
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:38,103
Orlando, he knew too much,
got to snitching, so he had to go.

210
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:41,245
But then there's the kid...

211
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:43,336
Wallace.

212
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,985
But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight.
Check in with Wallace.

213
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:50,054
Wallace?

214
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:52,282
He off the hook
since we helped the tower crew...

215
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:53,380
get that stick-up boy.

216
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,255
I'm telling you, man, Wallace is bugging.

217
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,794
Don't hardly even come out
of that room no more.

218
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:00,922
-Now, why he be like that?
-I'm thinking he might be getting high.

219
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:03,364
-Wallace?
-The boy's scaring me with his shit.

220
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:05,959
-All right, holler at me later.
-That'll work.

221
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:10,006
You got that shit on tape?

222
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:18,644
-God!
-His name is Brandon Wright.

223
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:22,715
Burned him, broke fingers,
gouged an eye out, all kinds of fun.

224
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:25,012
Wallace was the one who saw.

225
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:29,624
He saw the boy.

226
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:33,194
But he really didn't
think about what they'd do.

227
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:36,927
You must have known.
You were standing there by that pay phone.

228
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,935
-You knew.
-What was I going to do?

229
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:44,201
I don't call String, word get back uptown,
what's going to happen then?

230
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:47,472
So, you told Wallace to wait,
then you called Stringer...

231
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,774
and Stringer, he gathered the troops.

232
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:51,416
Yeah.

233
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:54,980
And down at the Greek's,
they got Wallace to point the finger, right?

234
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:59,716
Then they went in like cops with handcuffs,
so they could take their time on Brandon.

235
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:02,385
They dropped the body where we'd see it.

236
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:05,824
"Send a message to the 'jects," they said.

237
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:07,228
Wallace...

238
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,496
he couldn't handle that.

239
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:13,593
After seeing that, he wanted to get out...

240
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:16,163
go back to school.

241
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,038
We even joked about it,
him being 16 and all...

242
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,514
needing to go start back
over again as a freshman.

243
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,245
About a week ago, my uncle and String,
they called me down to the club.

244
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,647
Stringer, he's all worried about Wallace,
and I told him.

245
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:34,952
I said, "Wallace ain't no snitch."

246
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:37,926
Plus, he's out the fucking game.

247
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:40,625
I told him that.

248
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,626
But I needed to do more.

249
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:46,501
I should've done more...

250
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,934
but I didn't, and, fuck, that's on me.

251
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,838
Any idea who they sent at Wallace?

252
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:01,509
Come on, Dee, wild guess.

253
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:06,087
Man, I don't know, could've been anybody.
You know, shooters come cheap.

254
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,623
I don't think so. Not in the Pit.

255
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:12,330
Not in his crib.
I counted seven beds when I was up there.

256
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,265
-Where were the young'uns?
-Look, if I knew, I would tell you.

257
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:20,703
All right? I swear to God, I would tell you.

258
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:26,138
They've charged with Orlando
and the undercover cop...

259
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:28,270
but we're still hunting.

260
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,318
Him, he in Philly.

261
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:38,950
-How you know?
-I know 'cause I dropped him there.

262
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,046
Where?

263
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:43,389
I don't know, a corner, North end,
I don't know where he be staying.

264
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:46,055
Did Wee-Bey say anything
to you about the shootings?

265
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:49,791
We don't talk shop in the car.
It's a rule we got.

266
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,465
So, is that it?

267
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:58,168
Your client must realize
that any agreement...

268
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:01,109
is dependent on his full cooperation.

269
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:02,839
There ain't nothing else.

270
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:13,183
Deidre.

271
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,030
Tap, tap, tap.

272
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,832
She was one of my uncle's girls.

273
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:31,067
But we got people who put you with her
the night she's killed.

274
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,542
Yeah, I didn't know
that he was going to do her.

275
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:35,641
I swear. They played me.

276
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,239
How so?

277
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:43,886
My uncle gave me an eight-ball of coke.

278
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:47,120
Told me to take it over there to her.

279
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:50,154
I was surprised, 'cause, you know,
I thought he dumped her.

280
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,559
But he said, no, it wasn't like that no more.

281
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:55,328
So, he had Wee-Bey take me over there.

282
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,128
You know, I walked up,
knocked on the door...

283
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:01,637
she came to the door, all naked and shit,
with this little-ass robe on.

284
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,039
So, she's your uncle's girl,
but she comes to the door for you naked?

285
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:07,611
She used to do that shit
with me all the time, man.

286
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:11,273
Teasing. You know how girls do.
Maybe you don't.

287
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:14,215
I don't know.

288
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:18,852
Anyway, I'm like,
"Ain't you going to let me come in?"

289
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:21,050
She says "No,"
because she got to get ready...

290
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,888
for my uncle to come by later.

291
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:25,219
So, I give her the coke.

292
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:29,398
She laughs about how she's going to
put that shit on ice, for later on.

293
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:32,068
Refrigerate it.

294
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:37,364
I don't know shit about no refrigerator.
Like I said, I didn't go in.

295
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,841
I turned around,
started walking back to the truck...

296
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:41,343
and I heard this shot.

297
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,212
Wee-Bey, he come running back with
this big-ass .45 he liked to use so much.

298
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:48,114
Tells me how he was tapping
on the window, real soft.

299
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:50,811
How with the lights on,
she had to walk all the way up...

300
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:53,720
because she couldn't see
what was on the outside.

301
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:57,586
And when she gets up
to the window and looks out....

302
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,333
You did good, D'Angelo.

303
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:09,005
Yeah, you did.

304
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:26,682
Y'all don't understand, man.

305
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,555
Y'all don't get it.

306
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,587
You grow up in this shit.

307
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:37,092
My grandfather was Butch Stamford.

308
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:40,430
You know who Butch Stamford
was in this town?

309
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:47,803
All my people, man,
my father, my uncles, my cousins...

310
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,413
it's just what we do.

311
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:57,046
You just live with this shit...

312
00:21:57,956 --> 00:21:59,719
until you can't breathe no more.

313
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:06,355
I swear to God,
I was courtside for eight months...

314
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:11,158
and I was freer in jail than I was at home.

315
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:14,870
What are you looking for?

316
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,642
I want it to go away.

317
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,780
-I can't--
-I want what Wallace wanted.

318
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:25,048
I want to start over.

319
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,617
That's what I want. I don't care where.

320
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,847
Anywhere. I don't give a fuck.

321
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:35,085
I just want to go somewhere
where I can breathe like regular folk.

322
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:38,586
You give me that...

323
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,697
and I'll give you them.

324
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:47,605
No, that's great. Really great.

325
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:50,597
No, that's great. Really great.

326
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:52,767
Yeah.

327
00:22:55,346 --> 00:22:56,438
That's our move.

328
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:03,477
Okay.

329
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:15,860
We broke it open tonight. Wide open.

330
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:18,399
I'm bringing this case in big.

331
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:26,272
So, this squares things with Burrell, right?

332
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:31,772
To hell with the man.

333
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,647
But I think we might have enough
to reach out to the feds...

334
00:23:34,752 --> 00:23:36,583
try to run this thing through them.

335
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:37,677
Cedric.

336
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,087
He knows about the money, Marla.

337
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:42,259
He's known for a long while.

338
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:46,156
Fact is, I wouldn't be surprised
if it's why he picked me for this case.

339
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:50,527
What does he.... What are you going to--

340
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:53,832
He's got me if he wants me.
Thing is, I don't think he wants me.

341
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:56,367
Too much at stake.

342
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:58,803
Too much mess.

343
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:05,614
Kind of like this case.

344
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:13,082
I have to admit it, Jimmy,
this is a great case.

345
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:16,592
Not just because of Greggs,
because it goes to that and answers that...

346
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:19,219
but because of how deep it goes.

347
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,821
I mean, the murders, the money--

348
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:26,331
Jesus, I feel like I've been drunk
ever since that kid started talking to us.

349
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:27,961
You okay to drive?

350
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:30,540
I can drop you home.
You can pick up your car tomorrow.

351
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:35,545
No, I'm good.
I'm great, this was fucking great!

352
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:40,317
You want to try to go federal with this?
I am up for it.

353
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:45,117
I get cross-designated as an AUSA,
and we can really run with it, you know?

354
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,857
Career fucking case.

355
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,992
Anyway....

356
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:05,934
Ronnie, the thing at...

357
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:10,180
Levy's the other day, I was....

358
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:11,673
I was--

359
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:23,792
Jesus, Ronnie, not here.
What are you doing?

360
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:27,657
Like you never did it
in the headquarters garage before?

361
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:47,845
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

362
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:50,755
Look what just walked in
without a fucking escort.

363
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:54,380
Downtown Roy Brown, the living legend...

364
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,517
in his own mind.

365
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,629
Uptown Lester Freamon.

366
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:02,291
Fuck me, how long's it been?

367
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:06,025
Your retirement party, wasn't it?
And this is retirement?

368
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:08,162
Yeah. Nice fucking digs?

369
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:11,699
I asked my supervisor when
I'll see a little sunlight.

370
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:15,343
Runt cocksucker says,
"When your unit turns a profit."

371
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,540
But enough of my joy.

372
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:20,912
What do you guys need?

373
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,147
We need a trap and trace,
but not in Maryland.

374
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:28,188
-Pennsylvania, Philly.
-You got to go through them.

375
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:31,056
We try that, we lose a week,
they tell us it can't be done...

376
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:33,187
then another week to okay our subpoena.

377
00:26:33,297 --> 00:26:36,095
It's a little more complicated
than just a straight-up trace.

378
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,330
We actually need a list of phones in Philly
that called this number in the past week.

379
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,637
-What's the number?
-Drug lawyer, downtown office.

380
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:48,368
Thought Billing would be the place to look.

381
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:52,581
If we can do it, and I'm not saying we can...

382
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:55,208
it's going to be a fucking week, maybe two.

383
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:58,681
Thanks, Roy.

384
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,520
Lester, isn't this supposed to be the time...

385
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:04,686
you tell me how
all-fired fucking important this is?

386
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:15,202
The Philly number gives us the mope
who shot that female undercover.

387
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:23,942
I'm telling you, Fitz, it's the perfect case.

388
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:26,039
-You'll love it.
-It sounds great.

389
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:29,976
But like I said, Jimmy,
we're not fishing for drug cases anymore.

390
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:31,679
Try DEA.

391
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:34,189
No, that field office is too close to our CID.

392
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:37,125
We go there, our bosses know it
before a meeting is scheduled.

393
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,696
Your bosses don't know you're doing this?

394
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,191
Who'll be coming?

395
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:46,298
Me, a detective name of Freamon,
and Daniels.

396
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:51,499
I can speak for Daniels, brother.
He's played this thing out with real heart.

397
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,010
Come on, set something up.

398
00:27:57,515 --> 00:27:58,539
All right.

399
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,891
Could I get 10 copies?

400
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:14,488
-10 copies?
-10, right.

401
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,374
No problems?

402
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:27,568
No.

403
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:29,935
No?

404
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,415
All right, man, I'll get at you.

405
00:28:46,564 --> 00:28:48,031
You locked that door, right?

406
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:52,662
Yeah? All right, so listen.
It's not street-ready, all right?

407
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:55,465
So, everybody got to work
on their own cut and vial up.

408
00:28:55,573 --> 00:28:58,736
Now, listen to me,
tell them to get this straight.

409
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:04,813
Three parts of this, all right?
To one of raw, all right?

410
00:29:04,949 --> 00:29:07,474
And that's how we gonna do
until we get the new stash.

411
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:10,884
And I want you to put the word out there
that we're back up.

412
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:12,922
Understand me?

413
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:14,318
We're back up.

414
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:16,120
It's a good target.

415
00:29:16,994 --> 00:29:18,825
You guys have a pretty good case here.

416
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,227
Look at the violence alone.

417
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:23,698
There's at least a dozen murders,
including state's witnesses.

418
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:27,635
If you can help us squeeze the Barksdale kid
into a witness protection program...

419
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:29,103
we can run wild with this thing.

420
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:32,973
-No suppliers though.
-We're still looking for a way into that.

421
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:36,277
There was nothing on the wire
that took us toward New York.

422
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,783
The trouble is,
we have these post-9l1 1 protocols.

423
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:43,245
We can't pick up any new narcotics work...

424
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:46,016
unless it goes to priority
organized-crime targets.

425
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:50,025
Meaning Cosa Nostra or Colombians.
Or Russians maybe.

426
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,095
We don't have any Colombians in Baltimore.

427
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:53,458
We don't have any wise guys.

428
00:29:53,564 --> 00:29:57,193
All we got is a whole lot of locals
a little busy tearing the Westside apart.

429
00:29:57,301 --> 00:30:00,202
I hear you,
but the Bureau-wide protocol applies.

430
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:03,631
To run with you on this,
we need a recognized OC target...

431
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:06,869
or, even better, a connect to
counterterrorism or corruption.

432
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:08,536
You go near stuff like that...

433
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:11,046
we have something
we can bring to our ASAC.

434
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:12,877
What kind of corruption?

435
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:14,384
Don't know.

436
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:16,077
What kind you got?

437
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,890
Poot, we up yet?

438
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:24,154
-Where Roc-Roc at with the shit?
-Package in.

439
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:26,151
Who is it?

440
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:28,824
-Onion and them off-brand niggers.
-Onion?

441
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:34,067
-What the fuck they got?
-Some shit they call yellow tops.

442
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:35,632
Yellow tops?

443
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:40,069
Got them yellow tops, y'all, yellow tops.

444
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:46,807
Yellows tops.

445
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,818
-Got them yellow tops.
-Motherfucker, what the fuck is up?

446
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,048
Fuck is y'all doing?

447
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:55,920
Do what you feel.
But be ready to finish what you start.

448
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,956
What you doing?
This ain't no open market, you know that.

449
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:00,291
Ain't no market at all, nigger.

450
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,390
You ain't got shit to sell.
Back that ass up for those that do.

451
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:05,435
-You know what?
-What?

452
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:07,697
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

453
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:15,803
-See, that's why we can't win.
-Why not?

454
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:21,177
-They fuck up, they get beat.
-We fuck up, they give us pensions.

455
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,054
Close it! Get the fuck out of here!

456
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:47,269
Heard you ain't much as an eyeball witness.

457
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:50,475
Bad as any civilian.

458
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:53,076
Guess so.

459
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,886
Where we at?

460
00:31:59,924 --> 00:32:01,221
With what?

461
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:03,054
With the case, fool.

462
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:06,092
Jesus, give it a rest.

463
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,963
What's on the wire?

464
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,961
-Come on, man.
-Wire's dead.

465
00:32:16,474 --> 00:32:19,204
They changed up after we
hit them with raids.

466
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,278
Daniels didn't tell you?

467
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:23,074
Hell, no.

468
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:26,282
He only talks to me about the good shit.

469
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:29,814
About how y'all were
onto my shooters and stuff.

470
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,584
Yeah, well, we lost the wire,
but the good news is D'Angelo's flipped...

471
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:38,756
-and we're talking to the feds about maybe--
-Fuck both y'all.

472
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:45,535
She wants me to quit.

473
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:50,365
Says there ain't nothing worth this.

474
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,372
So, I promised her I'd think about it.

475
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,310
What do you say?

476
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:01,314
I don't know.

477
00:33:02,286 --> 00:33:06,620
I guess you should do what you need to.

478
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:09,691
But she's right.

479
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:12,818
It isn't worth it.

480
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,789
No?

481
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah. Probably not.

482
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:32,648
Anyway, what took you so long
getting up in here?

483
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:37,212
Shit, no cards, no flowers.

484
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:39,482
I mean, what the fuck, Jimmy?

485
00:33:39,623 --> 00:33:40,851
I couldn't, l...

486
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:44,556
I felt....

487
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,790
A case like this, it's always you or Sydnor...

488
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,096
or some other black cop
who ends up going undercover.

489
00:33:58,142 --> 00:34:00,133
I swear, if I could do it over....

490
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:05,175
If l....

491
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:08,044
If I could do it over...

492
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:12,112
you know what I'd do?

493
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:17,359
Put more tape on that fucking gun.

494
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:22,496
I'm sorry, Kima.

495
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:26,097
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:32,842
Anyway, since I got you up in here...

497
00:34:32,943 --> 00:34:34,638
acting like my bitch and shit...

498
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,648
with all your guilty-ass crying
and whatnot...

499
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:43,483
maybe you can do something for me.

500
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:47,747
She said you were doing good.
Said she was proud of you.

501
00:34:51,028 --> 00:34:52,518
How's she doing?

502
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:55,157
Still shook.

503
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,266
But she wanted you to have that...

504
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:01,429
and told me to tell you
she's sorry to be late with it.

505
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:04,968
Girl got such heart, you know?

506
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:06,667
Yeah.

507
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:12,778
This is enough for what
I got going now, man.

508
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,851
You give the rest back to her.

509
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:19,115
Are you sure?

510
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,461
Give her my love.

511
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:32,360
Right.

512
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:36,931
McNulty.

513
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:42,339
Don't tell her.

514
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:53,319
-What you got, man?
-Over there, man.

515
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:58,226
Un-fucking-believable.
Five guys got jumped. Not just you.

516
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:01,660
-Four other guys jumped me.
-I'm sorry, man.

517
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,059
It's got to be all the brutality complaints...

518
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:08,627
which means it ain't never gonna matter
how well I do on no fucking test.

519
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:11,572
You don't know that.
You might make the next list, you know?

520
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:13,269
You don't know.

521
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:16,442
Guess I ain't leadership material.

522
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:19,175
-Congratulations, Carv.
-Thanks.

523
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:22,909
Yeah?

524
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:42,164
The world is on its ass.

525
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,310
Guy called for you from the phone company.

526
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:51,313
Says he's got the number you wanted
for a house in Philadelphia.

527
00:36:51,415 --> 00:36:52,746
Beautiful, thank you.

528
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,389
-Good casework.
-Thank you.

529
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:05,358
I don't think I'm giving anything away...

530
00:37:05,462 --> 00:37:08,226
by telling that Arnold here
has had a file on Senator Davis...

531
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:09,299
for two and a half years.

532
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,631
It took us a while to see it,
but the quid pro quo is right there...

533
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:15,034
in that Westside redevelopment mess.

534
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:18,438
Barksdale, or his fronts,
grease enough city politicians...

535
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:22,569
and word comes back years in advance
where the development zone's going to be.

536
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,171
He buys up every piece
of garbage real estate he can...

537
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,773
flips it three or four times,
exaggerating the values.

538
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:29,375
The city's gonna pay him millions...

539
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:31,784
to condemn the properties
for the renewal project.

540
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:34,380
It's a lot to work with, but we're willing.

541
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:38,320
The question is,
can your cooperator give us the senator...

542
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:40,053
or any other political figure?

543
00:37:40,497 --> 00:37:42,897
-The cooperator?
-D'Angelo Barksdale.

544
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:46,167
What does he have for us on the money?

545
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:51,568
Nothing.

546
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:54,403
He gives you the drugs and the violence.

547
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,775
He gives you Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.

548
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,111
-And they give us the senator.
-Maybe, yeah.

549
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:03,380
You're talking about turning Barksdale
and Bell into cooperators...

550
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,580
and making the politicians
the primary target?

551
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:06,849
Of course.

552
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:07,157
No, fuck the politicians.
It's Barksdale and Bell.

553
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:09,819
No, fuck the politicians.
It's Barksdale and Bell.

554
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,857
Those guys have
turned West Baltimore into a free-fire zone.

555
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:14,260
No one's saying they walk.

556
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:16,855
What you are saying is that
if we bring you the case...

557
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:20,061
it's your intention to let Barksdale
and Bell reduce any sentence...

558
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,501
they get through cooperation?

559
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:24,938
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?
You're seeing all this ass-backwards.

560
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:28,705
Detective, in this office we have a mandate
to pursue political corruption.

561
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:30,245
Can you believe these guys?

562
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:32,144
-Jimmy, look.
-What?

563
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:36,078
Drugs and murder don't cut it anymore?
How about terrorism?

564
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,486
These guys have dropped 14, 15 bodies.
The witnesses, cooperators--

565
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:43,219
That kind of hyperbole
doesn't serve anyone, detective.

566
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,232
I think we're going with
a different direction on this.

567
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,032
Thank you for your time.

568
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:03,307
West Baltimore is dying,
and you empty suits...

569
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:07,179
are running around trying to pin
some politician's pelt to the wall.

570
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:12,046
Thought you was real police, brother.

571
00:39:38,015 --> 00:39:40,381
So, they got you all the way out here?

572
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,678
I started out thinking you was in Jersey.

573
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:46,083
You ain't in Jersey.

574
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,318
I figured they still got you
down in Central Booking.

575
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,358
But, all the way out here....

576
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,054
Do send a message, though.

577
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:57,690
Yeah, a message needs sending.

578
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,602
How y'all even find me?

579
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:05,302
Ain't no one going to keep
a mother from her son, right?

580
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:13,978
You know, he's always talking family.

581
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:17,643
"Family is the heart," he say.

582
00:40:18,055 --> 00:40:20,285
Well, I'm family...

583
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,414
ain't l?

584
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:26,452
What about me for once?

585
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:29,332
It ain't right.

586
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,267
What's right?

587
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:38,202
You like for him to step up,
take all the weight, and let you walk?

588
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:41,604
Because he will. You know he will.

589
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:44,680
But if he got to go away...

590
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:47,475
that mean you got to step up
and fill his shoes.

591
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:49,449
You ready for that?

592
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:51,984
Ma, you know I ain't.

593
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,390
I ain't ready,
and I'm never gonna be ready for this game.

594
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:56,982
-Dee, come on.
-Look.

595
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:00,557
They're giving me a chance to walk away...

596
00:41:01,031 --> 00:41:03,056
to start again someplace else.

597
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:06,998
And what you giving them?

598
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:14,167
Look....

599
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:19,213
He messed up, Dee, he knows it.

600
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:23,978
Now if you want to get even
with him, you can.

601
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,820
But if you hurt him,
you hurt this whole family.

602
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:31,689
All of us. Me and Trina and the cousins.

603
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:35,221
And Donette, too. And your baby.

604
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:37,331
Your own baby boy.

605
00:41:39,136 --> 00:41:41,696
This right here is part of the game, Dee.

606
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:43,565
And without the game...

607
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:46,199
this whole family would be
down in the fucking Terrace...

608
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,470
Iiving off scraps.

609
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:50,205
Shit, we probably wouldn't even be a family.

610
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:53,105
Start over?

611
00:41:54,284 --> 00:41:57,481
How the fuck you going to
start over without your peoples?

612
00:41:57,654 --> 00:41:59,349
Without your own child, even?

613
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:06,690
If you ain't got family in this world...

614
00:42:07,097 --> 00:42:08,860
what the hell you got?

615
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:17,501
This motherfucker Wee-Bey twitches,
there won't even be a trial.

616
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:22,603
Detective Carver, a word?

617
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,451
Shut the door.

618
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:44,366
What's up, Lieutenant?

619
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:48,698
Anything you want to tell me?

620
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,008
Been weeks now...

621
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:58,138
the Deputy Ops knows what's going on
in this unit almost before I do.

622
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:01,647
Except last week...

623
00:43:01,985 --> 00:43:04,715
we run the bug up
into Barksdale's club office...

624
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:08,847
and Burrell, for once, he's a step behind.

625
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:11,086
You see it?

626
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,556
-Maybe he--
-I see it.

627
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:20,164
I look around the office...

628
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,263
and I see that one of my people
is at the academy for in-service.

629
00:43:27,344 --> 00:43:29,608
Lieutenant, I swear, it wasn't my idea.

630
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:33,246
I'm minding my business,
doing my fucking job...

631
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,614
when the man calls me
for coffee and a Danish.

632
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:39,280
I mean, I never even been on
the eighth floor of that fucking building.

633
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:41,016
And there's the Deputy fucking Ops...

634
00:43:41,124 --> 00:43:43,649
telling me how concerned
he is about the case...

635
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,062
how he needs to be informed.

636
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:52,028
I mean, he's the Deputy fucking Ops, man.

637
00:44:05,682 --> 00:44:07,377
Couple weeks from now...

638
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:09,786
you're gonna be
in some district somewhere...

639
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:13,151
with 1 1 or 1 2 uniforms
looking to you for everything.

640
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:17,586
And some of them
are going to be good police.

641
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:20,220
Some of them are going to
be young and stupid.

642
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,230
A few are going to be pieces of shit.

643
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:25,893
But all of them will take their cue from you.

644
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:29,962
You show loyalty, they learn loyalty.

645
00:44:30,073 --> 00:44:32,837
You show them it's about the work,
it'll be about the work.

646
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:36,879
You show them some other kind of game,
then that's the game they'll play.

647
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,482
I came on in the Eastern...

648
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:52,286
and there was a piece-of-shit lieutenant
hoping to be a captain...

649
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:54,659
piece-of-shit sergeants
hoping to be lieutenants.

650
00:44:54,764 --> 00:44:59,201
Pretty soon we had piece-of-shit patrolmen
trying to figure the job for themselves.

651
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:03,398
And some of what happens then
is hard as hell to live down.

652
00:45:16,786 --> 00:45:21,416
Comes a day you're going to have to decide
whether it's about you or about the work.

653
00:45:35,238 --> 00:45:37,206
Grand jury came in Tuesday.

654
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,737
But you knew that, right?

655
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:44,478
We're working a flight warrant today.

656
00:45:44,848 --> 00:45:48,614
There's a lot to do here, in-office.

657
00:45:50,554 --> 00:45:52,784
I'd be careful with that, though.

658
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:55,619
I understand the trigger pull
used to be light.

659
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:29,491
Keep him down, keep him down.

660
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:34,025
You got him? Get him up there, get him up.

661
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:39,359
Bunch of low-bottom bitches.

662
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:42,801
-Get his wrists.
-Y'all didn't have to fuck with my ride.

663
00:46:48,612 --> 00:46:50,409
Motherfuckers got lucky.

664
00:47:04,928 --> 00:47:05,952
Yeah?

665
00:47:11,134 --> 00:47:13,830
Podunk lawyer in Denton's
giving the guards a hard time...

666
00:47:13,937 --> 00:47:16,735
about moving D'Angelo
from original jurisdiction.

667
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,830
Put the call through.

668
00:47:19,876 --> 00:47:20,865
Okay.

669
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,378
Officer Mace, ASA Pearlman,
you got a problem with the lawyer?

670
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,720
Okay, put the asshole on.

671
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:36,685
This is he.

672
00:47:46,202 --> 00:47:51,037
You do not make it easy, Jimmy.
I have to admit, I am deeply ambivalent.

673
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:53,709
-Excuse me?
-Sit.

674
00:47:54,577 --> 00:47:55,737
Sit!

675
00:47:57,847 --> 00:48:01,442
-Here.
-I heard from Bunk.

676
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:04,051
Philly. Great work.

677
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:06,148
You all did great work.

678
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:09,287
And the number of clearances
I'm looking at here...

679
00:48:09,392 --> 00:48:13,726
Christ, for the first time this year,
we got the clearance rate up over 40%.

680
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,161
That's on the one hand.

681
00:48:15,498 --> 00:48:19,161
On the other hand, I know the Deputy Ops
got a call from the first deputy...

682
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:20,702
U.S. Attorney this morning...

683
00:48:20,804 --> 00:48:24,399
asking whether an asshole such as yourself
really works for us.

684
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:28,537
Of course, this is the first the Deputy
hears his troops...

685
00:48:28,645 --> 00:48:31,079
are creeping behind his back
to take a case federal...

686
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:34,241
when they've already been told
the case is closed.

687
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:37,681
You're a good detective.

688
00:48:38,054 --> 00:48:40,784
And I've got to admit
you got some stones on you.

689
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:44,384
Did you actually call
the first deputy an empty suit?

690
00:48:49,132 --> 00:48:51,100
I want to see you land okay, Jimmy.

691
00:48:51,835 --> 00:48:54,861
So, tell me, where don't you want to go?

692
00:48:58,742 --> 00:49:02,838
You all know that Baltimore city jurors
are capable of just about anything.

693
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:05,471
Now, look, you want to sit
around for months on end...

694
00:49:05,582 --> 00:49:07,311
going through a bunch of half-heard...

695
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:10,648
half-said telephone conversations
and see how well you do...

696
00:49:10,954 --> 00:49:14,219
-I'll certainly respect the effort.
-It's not just talk on the wire.

697
00:49:14,324 --> 00:49:16,758
We've got seized money
and lot of dope on the table.

698
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,827
And a lot of violence.

699
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:20,259
All of which stops
way short of Mr. Barksdale.

700
00:49:20,363 --> 00:49:21,352
You know this.

701
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:25,161
All of it except for the New Jersey bust.
That one he eats.

702
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:27,369
Maybe he does.

703
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,403
Maybe he pleads to one count
of attempted possession...

704
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:32,907
and takes, I don't know, maybe three, four.

705
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:36,003
Maybe he can arrange
for everyone you have...

706
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:37,977
on those tapes to follow suit.

707
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:42,441
Maybe you get five-year pleas from those
with no prior felony convictions...

708
00:49:42,552 --> 00:49:46,249
10 years for those with one prior,
15 for two or more.

709
00:49:46,356 --> 00:49:47,948
What about the murders?

710
00:49:48,057 --> 00:49:50,457
Maybe we acknowledge
you've got Mr. Brice cold for...

711
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,324
murder of Orlando Blocker
and wounding of the police officer.

712
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,694
-Who?
-Wee-Bey.

713
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:57,592
Representing Mr. Brice...

714
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,328
I'm fairly confident that
to avoid the death penalty...

715
00:50:00,437 --> 00:50:04,464
he'll proffer to at least a half dozen
of your open murders.

716
00:50:04,574 --> 00:50:06,439
Naming co-conspirators?

717
00:50:06,543 --> 00:50:09,910
For that kind of cooperation,
I'd be willing to consider straight life.

718
00:50:10,013 --> 00:50:10,980
No, indeed.

719
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,709
I believe Mr. Brice is ready
to take sole responsibility...

720
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:16,376
for all of his crimes.

721
00:50:16,486 --> 00:50:19,819
Still, you walk away
with at least a half-dozen clearances.

722
00:50:19,923 --> 00:50:20,912
Assets.

723
00:50:21,024 --> 00:50:23,925
You take the strip club,
you take whatever trucks and cars...

724
00:50:24,027 --> 00:50:27,656
you can link to the drug trafficking,
and also whatever cash you've seized.

725
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:31,723
He's got dozens of other properties:
the funeral parlor, the towing company.

726
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:32,435
No. You get the cars,
because you can tie them to illegal activity.

727
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:35,734
No. You get the cars,
because you can tie them to illegal activity.

728
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,636
But there's nothing else of his to take.

729
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,334
So, you keep most of the money,
most of the real estate...

730
00:50:40,443 --> 00:50:44,243
and Stringer Bell stays on the street
with his hand on the throttle.

731
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:47,548
If you have a charge against Mr. Bell, file it.

732
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:52,110
Otherwise, I understand that nothing
in all those hours of tape implicates him.

733
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:59,088
Three or four years ain't enough, Maury.

734
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:01,627
Not for Avon Barksdale.

735
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:02,755
No?

736
00:51:07,003 --> 00:51:08,027
Make an offer.

737
00:51:08,137 --> 00:51:11,470
Part 14 of the circuit court
of Baltimore City now in session.

738
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:12,742
-Be seated.
-First up.

739
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:13,731
-Be seated.
-First up.

740
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:16,778
State versus Avon Randolph Barksdale,
Your Honor.

741
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,314
One count of possession
with intent to distribute...

742
00:51:19,415 --> 00:51:20,746
to wit, a kilogram of heroin.

743
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,148
-You have a statement of facts?
-Yes, Your Honor.

744
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:25,346
Mr. Barksdale is offering a plea of guilty...

745
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:28,117
in exchange for a maximum
of seven years in DOC...

746
00:51:28,224 --> 00:51:30,852
in consideration of
the following agreed-upon facts:

747
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,520
On or about the date
of September 17, 2002...

748
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,190
in the jurisdiction
of Essex County, New Jersey...

749
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:38,859
Trooper Robert Warren
of the Newark barracks...

750
00:51:38,968 --> 00:51:41,436
effected a traffic stop
on a rented Ford Taurus...

751
00:51:41,538 --> 00:51:43,665
traveling southbound near Exit 13.

752
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:46,207
That traffic stop resulted
from information gleaned...

753
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:50,336
from electronic surveillance of Mr. Barksdale
and his nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale...

754
00:51:50,446 --> 00:51:52,471
by detectives assigned to a special detail...

755
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:55,016
under the command
of a city narcotics supervisor.

756
00:51:55,118 --> 00:51:58,815
A search of the vehicle, rented
from the Avis location at B.W.I. Airport...

757
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:01,083
revealed that a kilogram
of nearly pure heroin...

758
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,057
was concealed beneath
the spare tire in the car trunk.

759
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,687
In accepting this plea, Mr. Barksdale
acknowledges his role in procuring...

760
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:11,824
those drugs with the intent to dilute,
package, and sell retail amounts of heroin....

761
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:15,996
Deidre Kresson, Roland Leggett,
Toreen Boyd, all tied to the same gun.

762
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:19,836
Plus, we got the stick-up boys,
Brandon Wright, John Bailey.

763
00:52:19,943 --> 00:52:22,138
With Orlando, that makes six.

764
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:24,270
Plus the attempted murder on a police.

765
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,608
That it?

766
00:52:25,882 --> 00:52:29,682
-I do better if I give them more?
-Life, no parole, means what it says.

767
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:32,380
This proffer keeps you off death row.
That's all it does.

768
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:35,321
You were on the wrong side
of a cop getting shot, Mr. Brice.

769
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:38,019
You want to dream
about straight life for these bodies...

770
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:40,322
you got to wake up
talking about Avon Barksdale...

771
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,591
-and Stringer Bell.
-No.

772
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:45,497
But for murders, you might as well
give them what you have...

773
00:52:45,602 --> 00:52:48,435
because anything you leave out
is outside the deal.

774
00:52:48,538 --> 00:52:51,132
If they learn about it later,
they can charge you later.

775
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,298
Fuck it then.

776
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:55,070
For another pit sandwich
and some potato salad...

777
00:52:55,178 --> 00:52:56,873
I'll go a few more.

778
00:52:59,148 --> 00:53:02,584
-How you want that?
-Medium rare, a lot of horseradish.

779
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:09,683
All right, I did Little Man...

780
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:12,260
thinking he might get weak
on that cop getting shot.

781
00:53:12,362 --> 00:53:14,330
Yeah? Where's the body?

782
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,194
Druid Hill. Behind the reptile house.

783
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,736
You get back in them weeds,
you might could find what's left of him.

784
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:23,499
All right, that's seven. What else you got?

785
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:27,376
How about them witnesses?

786
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:32,506
The security lady,
and what's his name, the maintenance man?

787
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,617
Gant?

788
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:36,582
Yeah, Gant.

789
00:53:37,086 --> 00:53:38,815
You did Gant alone?

790
00:53:43,426 --> 00:53:45,917
They're out of potato salad.
How about slaw?

791
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:50,465
Information gleaned
from electronic surveillance...

792
00:53:50,566 --> 00:53:54,127
would also show that
Mr. Watkins, a.k.a. Ronnie Moe...

793
00:53:54,237 --> 00:53:58,469
was integrally involved in the distribution
of heroin and cocaine in the high-rises...

794
00:53:58,574 --> 00:54:01,634
at 734 Fayette and 221 North Fremont.

795
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:04,872
In exchange for his pleading guilty
to one count of conspiracy...

796
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:08,314
he agrees to a sentence
not to exceed 15 years in DOC.

797
00:54:08,418 --> 00:54:11,478
Mr. Watkins, who is on probation
for a drug distribution charge...

798
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:14,522
that was adjudicated
in judge Prevas' court in August, 2001 ....

799
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:21,390
Cedric!

800
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:24,622
Major Cantrell.

801
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:27,502
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

802
00:54:27,603 --> 00:54:30,800
-So, where they sending you?
-Northwest. Spurgeon's retiring.

803
00:54:32,008 --> 00:54:35,444
-I heard that was going to happen.
-Ever feel like a change, give a yell.

804
00:54:35,545 --> 00:54:37,172
I could use a good shift lieutenant.

805
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,840
I mean, right now, the whole
fucking district's a mess.

806
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:41,348
What isn't?

807
00:54:41,451 --> 00:54:43,749
-Good seeing you.
-You, too.

808
00:54:50,526 --> 00:54:53,689
You see, this ain't no DEU. It ain't like that.

809
00:54:54,397 --> 00:54:57,264
When you all came downtown,
the job changed.

810
00:54:57,366 --> 00:55:00,563
Down here, we make big cases,
big hairy-balled cases...

811
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,433
Iike this Barksdale thing, right?

812
00:55:02,538 --> 00:55:05,666
And all that mess
you call police work down in the districts...

813
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:09,302
all that fuck-somebody-up
and rip-and-run bullshit...

814
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:10,970
it won't play down here.

815
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:14,672
You think I'm kidding.
This is what makes cases, gentlemen.

816
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:15,718
This!

817
00:55:17,553 --> 00:55:18,918
Remember that.

818
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:35,468
Nicely done.

819
00:55:45,114 --> 00:55:48,015
Motherfucker, I been here
since lunch, waiting.

820
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:50,381
Ain't nobody been through here.

821
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,347
You hear me?
I been waiting and y'all ain't about shit.

822
00:55:55,825 --> 00:55:57,554
Yeah, listen, listen to me.

823
00:55:57,927 --> 00:56:00,555
Look, if you feel like that,
then get off this phone...

824
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:03,029
come down here
and step to me then, nigger.

825
00:56:03,332 --> 00:56:04,890
Yeah, all right.

826
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:08,599
Yo, if Roc-Roc ain't here
in 10 minutes with my re-up...

827
00:56:08,704 --> 00:56:10,399
whoop his ass, man.

828
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,385
I understand you did
a tour in Homicide years ago...

829
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,449
but let me tell you how I run this unit,
because how I run it is how it runs.

830
00:56:31,594 --> 00:56:34,586
We work on a strict rotation.
You're up until you catch a call...

831
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:38,133
then you step down, work your case,
and someone else steps up behind you.

832
00:56:38,234 --> 00:56:42,068
This is the way we do business in a town
with 250, 300 murders a year.

833
00:56:42,438 --> 00:56:43,871
And it works.

834
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:49,107
You do not play the game for yourself,
you play it for us.

835
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:51,142
If you remember these few rules...

836
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:54,011
you'll find me to be
supportive and reasonable.

837
00:56:54,116 --> 00:56:55,879
Very reasonable, sir.

838
00:56:56,986 --> 00:57:00,114
-That's what they say about me.
-They say that, they do.

839
00:57:26,115 --> 00:57:27,343
Yo, Dink!

840
00:57:32,154 --> 00:57:34,145
What the fuck was that?

841
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,015
You take a nigger's money,
then you serve him?

842
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:38,593
What the fuck?

843
00:57:42,999 --> 00:57:45,092
I'm saying, you take their money...

844
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:47,965
then you send them round
and let some other nigger serve.

845
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,435
The way you doing it...

846
00:57:49,538 --> 00:57:51,836
someone snapping pictures
got the whole deal.

847
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:53,203
You hear?

848
00:57:59,248 --> 00:58:01,478
We got to tighten up around here, yo!

849
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,185
Jimmy.

850
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:15,153
Hell of a case.

851
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:17,728
Read all about it in the papers.

852
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:19,562
You done good, kiddo.

853
00:58:23,673 --> 00:58:25,004
I gotta....

854
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:35,277
D'Angelo Barksdale
supervised distribution...

855
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:38,080
in the low-rise courtyards
and was also involved...

856
00:58:38,187 --> 00:58:40,178
in the violence attributed
to the organization.

857
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:42,780
Further, he was arrested
by authorities in New Jersey...

858
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:47,022
in possession of a kilo of raw heroin
intended for distribution in Baltimore.

859
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:49,427
He acknowledges his role
as a leading conspirator...

860
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:52,592
and is already on parole
for two earlier counts of distribution...

861
00:58:52,702 --> 00:58:54,636
dating from March, 1999.

862
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:56,329
What are you asking here?

863
00:58:56,439 --> 00:59:00,967
As Mr. Barksdale has two prior convictions
and is insisting that the effort to purchase...

864
00:59:01,077 --> 00:59:03,545
and transport the kilo
was done on his own behest...

865
00:59:03,646 --> 00:59:06,706
and is refusing to cooperate against others
in the conspiracy...

866
00:59:06,816 --> 00:59:10,684
the state is offering only the maximum
allowable 20 years, Your Honor.

867
00:59:11,721 --> 00:59:15,350
Mr. Levy, this is your understanding
of the plea agreement?

868
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,291
-Yes, sir.
-Very well then, Mr. Barksdale.

869
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:21,227
-Can you hear me distinctly?
-Yes.

870
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,555
Are you now under
the influence of alcohol....

871
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,634
-Wee-Bey, man.
-How'd it go?

872
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:29,296
For life, no parole,
he puts himself in for Orlando...

873
00:59:29,405 --> 00:59:31,464
and the attempt murder on Greggs.

874
00:59:31,974 --> 00:59:34,499
Then he also takes Nakeisha Lyles...

875
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:38,671
Deidre Kresson, the two project murders
that match that gun...

876
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:41,648
both the stick-up boys, and Little Man.

877
00:59:42,018 --> 00:59:43,007
Little Man?

878
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,247
Yeah, body found up behind
the reptile house in Druid Hill.

879
00:59:47,423 --> 00:59:51,883
He gave us that one just for fun, I think.
He also takes William Gant.

880
00:59:53,963 --> 00:59:55,453
I know, it's bullshit.

881
00:59:55,564 --> 00:59:57,156
How'd he tell it?

882
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,166
-Boom.
-He said a contact wound?

883
01:00:02,638 --> 01:00:06,369
It doesn't play.
Gant had no compression, no stippling.

884
01:00:06,475 --> 01:00:08,807
Wound was to the front.
Bey's talking out of his ass.

885
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:12,506
I know, but this motherfucker's
just taking murders just to take them.

886
01:00:12,615 --> 01:00:15,550
He's taking life, no parole,
for shooting a cop, what the fuck?

887
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:17,846
Might as well try to spring Bird
for killing Gant.

888
01:00:17,953 --> 01:00:19,011
All rise.

889
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:49,717
Jesus, what the fuck did I do?

890
01:00:54,356 --> 01:00:56,153
You happy now, bitch?

891
01:03:53,269 --> 01:03:55,897
Are you the man with them jumbo sixes?

892
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:59,935
-How many you fucking want?
-Take about three or four hundred.

893
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:02,770
Damn.

894
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,812
All in the game, yo.

895
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:17,519
Right, but I didn't think--

896
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:23,866
For sure.

897
