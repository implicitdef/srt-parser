1
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,316
Wake up, Baltimore. It's 6:00 a.m....

2
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:28,616
Police!

3
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:44,218
Ready?

4
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:47,018
Freeze, FBl!

5
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,819
-All clear.
-Check upstairs.

6
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,719
Turn around.

7
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,619
Put your hands up. Behind your neck.

8
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,619
Keep them there.

9
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,321
No, nothing here. All clear.

10
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:56,424
All clear.

11
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,725
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.

12
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,625
Ain't got shit on me.

13
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,225
Fuck! You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you. Nothing!

14
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:26,726
Move, shitbird.

15
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,928
FBl, show me your hands!

16
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,829
Get down, fuck! Get down!

17
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,230
Nice.

18
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:21,431
Bingo.

19
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,231
-From behind your clothes washer.
-That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.

20
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,633
And on today's Chip Franklin Show
at noon...

21
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:44,233
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall
asking local retailers:

22
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,634
"What do you get
for the guy who has everything?"

23
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:48,734
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.

24
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,234
The Orioles continue to....

25
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:52,344
-We could take him now.
-Not enough profile.

26
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,145
Fucking feds.

27
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:59,344
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.

28
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:14,846
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?

29
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:18,846
The text message that told him to clean up,
it came from someone higher up.

30
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,247
Someone we don't know.

31
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,446
We leave him on the street
after these raids...

32
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:25,047
he'll probably make contact
with whoever's above him.

33
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:27,747
Either another text message or a meet.

34
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,948
What's with George Glekas?

35
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,847
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.

36
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:37,948
-Chester Karol Sobotka?
-It's Frank Sobotka's kid.

37
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,348
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?

38
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,848
Why? What for?

39
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,949
We hit the store this morning.

40
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:48,048
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.

41
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:51,249
So we go over to his house a half hour later
with the warrant...

42
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:55,850
and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations
looking at us like we're braindeads.

43
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,450
Homicide, Shea.

44
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,150
-This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
-Yes, sir.

45
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,050
Who caught the Highlandtown murder
the night before last?

46
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,850
Jay Landsman, sir.

47
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,551
I'll be right over.

48
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,952
Go get the interviews started.

49
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,153
-Lieutenant?
-Hey, Lt.

50
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:49,055
What the fuck is that about?

51
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,355
How did we do this morning?

52
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,454
Eton and Sergei are in. So is the madam.

53
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:57,455
Glekas, I'm not sure.

54
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:03,155
-The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
-What are they waiting for?

55
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:05,455
You don't wanna know.

56
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:06,056
Jesus, Larry....

57
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:07,055
Jesus, Larry....

58
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:10,656
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out
to a criminal lawyer real quick.

59
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,856
If the union guys can't handle this mess...

60
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,856
he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.

61
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:17,556
-Do you have any details?
-I don't know nothing...

62
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:20,257
except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.

63
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:23,157
-That's the only time?
-Visiting hours, yeah.

64
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:25,257
Look, everything's gonna be fine.

65
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:38,758
-FBl! All of you move, now!
-What the fuck is this?

66
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,759
-FBl, move!
-Against the wall.

67
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,959
He's here.

68
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,259
Got another problem here, Larry.

69
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,460
Big man on the docks.

70
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,361
You don't look so big now, do you?

71
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,964
Ma.

72
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:15,266
Pop.

73
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:31,168
It's gone.

74
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,169
And the money, too.

75
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,169
They say you need to come in.

76
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:42,169
They said the warrant
is at Southeastern police district.

77
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,070
They're out there now.

78
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,370
Showtime, Franky.

79
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,972
-Frank.
-Sir, any comment?

80
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,771
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?

81
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:14,171
What's your comment
on the charges being brought against you?

82
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:18,872
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?

83
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,773
How will you answer
the charges against you?

84
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:27,073
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working
all these dead girls for?

85
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:28,573
The Homicide unit, right?

86
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:32,573
The same Homicide unit that can't put
two and two together and pick up a phone...

87
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:36,373
Ieaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later
in The Baltimore Sun.

88
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:46,574
-What did you take from the scene?
-Photos, latents, spent casings.

89
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,075
Fuck.

90
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,675
They cleaned everything else?

91
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:58,476
Even for a supremely
fucked-up police department...

92
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,376
this takes the prize.

93
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,576
How'd the kid play it?

94
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,276
He signed a full statement.

95
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:14,777
He said that there was an argument
about a stolen car or two.

96
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:16,777
Think he'll open up and talk more?

97
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:18,978
He's been processed and assigned a PD.

98
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:23,377
If you want to take a run at the kid,
you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.

99
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,278
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. It's my bad.

100
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:36,579
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?

101
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:39,579
What's your name?

102
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,780
State your name.

103
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,880
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.

104
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,081
There is your name.

105
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,981
State your name.

106
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,082
No name?

107
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:16,882
-For now, we'll just call you Boris.
-Boris.

108
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,682
Why always "Boris"?

109
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,483
Racketeering. Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.

110
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,683
Conspiracy to violate
federal customs statutes.

111
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:30,283
White slavery.

112
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:35,384
Today we're only charging
the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.

113
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,884
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

114
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:40,284
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

115
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:46,985
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.

116
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:49,385
Help my union?

117
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:55,685
For 25 years,
we've been dying slow down there.

118
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,986
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.

119
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:04,186
My friends and their kids,
like we got the cancer.

120
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:07,986
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.

121
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:11,486
And now you wanna help us?

122
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:13,787
Help me?

123
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:22,788
-What's your full name?
-Michael McArdle.

124
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,588
-White Mike.
-Yeah, that's right.

125
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:25,988
Listen to this, Mikey.

126
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:27,688
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

127
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,988
dropped that body on Potee Street
the other night.

128
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,589
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with a Greek-ass name...

129
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,489
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

130
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,089
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

131
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,089
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

132
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:44,889
We hit your suppliers.

133
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:47,190
They cleaned up
and left you holding the dirt.

134
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,290
-Suppliers of what?
-You discussed a drug buy on this tape.

135
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,190
We also have photographs
tying you to your stash house...

136
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,291
and putting you at The Greek's warehouse
over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.

137
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:01,191
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.

138
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:16,392
-What's the plan?
-This is just a detention hearing, Frank.

139
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:19,193
You're not a flight risk,
you have no meaningful priors.

140
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,693
And so far they've only hit you
with one count.

141
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:24,693
The magistrate's gonna ask us
some basic questions.

142
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,293
Barring anything unforeseen,
you're out in an hour.

143
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,994
-I said nothing to them suits.
-All the better.

144
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:34,894
-This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
-The dope.

145
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:37,394
He's what, Greek?

146
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,895
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.

147
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:45,195
-And what about the guy they call Sergei?
-Sergei's straight muscle.

148
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:49,496
-Look, I need something to eat.
-Okay, what do you want?

149
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:52,595
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.

150
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:55,496
I'd fuck the order up.

151
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:59,697
It's gotta be strawberry?

152
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:01,597
Hook a brother up.

153
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:12,297
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.

154
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,398
It's all right.

155
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:22,698
Been what, a year?

156
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:27,199
Boy, you don't know,
I been dreaming of running into you again.

157
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,899
You got a focus. I give you that.

158
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,999
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?

159
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:34,699
I think you've done enough.

160
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,699
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.

161
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,200
He in jail now forever and a day.

162
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Stinkum? I mean, you closed the book
on that nigger your damn self.

163
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,301
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.

164
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,401
Leaving you.

165
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:54,001
-You looking for closure?
-Lookit, man, ain't no closure.

166
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,001
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave
and come up in this room right now.

167
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,801
See, all I know is whoever did him that way,
they gets got.

168
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:07,102
Whoever did him that way,
they still out there right now.

169
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:09,902
So now you gonna play like
you had nothing to do with it.

170
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:11,502
No, I can't lie.

171
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:16,003
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.

172
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,903
Anything after that, part of the game.

173
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,404
Maybe. But see,
I went past that with Brandon.

174
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:26,603
That wasn't me. That wasn't Avon, either.

175
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:31,404
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:

176
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,704
all that cigarette shit...

177
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,405
all that bullshit with the eyes.

178
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,905
See now, this man,
he building a rep for himself...

179
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:43,105
and he wants you bad.

180
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:46,505
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.

181
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:50,806
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker
from out of....

182
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:51,906
NYC?

183
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,306
Yeah, small dude.

184
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:58,606
What he go by?

185
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,607
Brother Mouzone.

186
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,307
I know you heard of him, right?

187
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,907
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...

188
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,108
I might be able to point you
in that direction.

189
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,608
Why?

190
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,008
What happened to your boy was business.

191
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:22,308
But how that shit happened,
you got the right to take that to heart.

192
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,609
I figure that'll make us even.

193
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,909
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?

194
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,909
-We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
-I gotta see my son.

195
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:36,710
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.

196
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,010
Not now, I need to get clean.

197
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,410
Sergei and them...

198
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,410
they did Mau Mau Willis.

199
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,411
-Why'd they chill him?
-He was welshing on the Jew.

200
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:54,812
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.

201
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,412
-Who's above those two, Mike?
-I don't know.

202
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:03,011
-You don't know?
-Never did wanna know.

203
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,513
God in heaven, Zig,
the cops do that to you?

204
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,514
Ain't the cops.

205
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:34,315
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.

206
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:37,215
I'm trying.

207
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,715
You know I'm trying, right?

208
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,016
-What happened?
-I don't know.

209
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,316
I got tired.

210
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,917
I got tired of being the punchline
to every joke.

211
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,818
You had problems,
you could've come to me.

212
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:06,117
You could've said something.

213
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:09,318
You wouldn't have heard.

214
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:13,618
You were always too busy
dredging up the canal.

215
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:17,619
Making sure the right bum got elected.

216
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,119
Buying another round for the house.

217
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:31,420
I always used to think you were working
all them hours you spent away.

218
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,420
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.

219
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,720
For you, for your mother.

220
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,121
I bet you didn't even tell her
I was in here, did you?

221
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,221
Maybe you did...

222
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,521
and she already took three Nembutals,
sleeping the day away.

223
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:54,021
-Leave her out of this.
-She's out of it, don't worry.

224
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:00,122
Pop...

225
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,823
when I seen what I did
to that kid down at the store...

226
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:09,122
it made me sick to my stomach.

227
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:13,923
-That ain't you, Zig.
-It ain't?

228
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:19,123
Because the same blood
don't flow for us, Pop.

229
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:21,824
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.

230
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:25,524
You're more like me than you know.

231
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:31,124
You're a Sobotka.

232
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:38,725
Fucked is what I am.

233
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:55,227
What the fuck can I say?

234
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:23,730
Best progress so far
is "White Mike" McArdle.

235
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,530
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.

236
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,630
We're gonna get Pearlman in today
to see what she can do to step him off.

237
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,630
Also, we're still hunting
the Sobotka nephew.

238
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,430
Herc and Carver are on that.

239
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,431
Still, my guess is the drug players...

240
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,531
even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.

241
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:45,231
The case gets thin when we get up to this...

242
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,631
Spiros Vondopoulos.

243
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:51,132
Boy, them Greeks
and those twisted-ass names.

244
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:53,631
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.

245
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:55,531
Yeah? Ass-fucking, too.

246
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:58,432
What exactly do we know
about Vondopoulos?

247
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:01,432
We should stay on him, see who he really is.

248
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,033
How about it?

249
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,533
Throw us a few
of your well-equipped surveillance teams?

250
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:10,533
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant,
I'm the only fed still in the room.

251
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,433
The US attorney has what he wants
with the union guys...

252
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:17,134
which means my field office
is pretty much over this case.

253
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,134
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.

254
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,235
I'm sorry for him...

255
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:28,835
and for you.

256
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:33,535
We should've paid more attention
to our own.

257
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:37,035
Like I could've stopped Ziggy
from what he'd done.

258
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:39,736
Like anyone could ever control him.

259
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,036
I was thinking of my boy, too.

260
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:46,736
They're dropping the net on all the guys.

261
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:49,737
Ain't no secret
things get lost in them cans now and again.

262
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:51,537
He'll be all right.

263
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:54,337
They tossed my house, Frank.

264
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:58,637
They don't do that when there's
a couple of cases of vodka missing.

265
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:05,638
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.

266
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,838
Heroin, Frank. From this house.

267
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,439
No, that ain't right. That can't be right.

268
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:19,339
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that. Nothing like this.

269
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,639
You knew?

270
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:25,940
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff
and seeing a little money...

271
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,340
what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?

272
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,140
No, Frank.

273
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,040
Once you gave him
a taste on the house, just....

274
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,341
That was never.... I mean, he knew. He knew.

275
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,141
Everything I did, the cans I let through...

276
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,841
the money we got from that
went to keeping what we had.

277
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:47,642
God damn it, Frank!

278
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:52,942
Don't let that excuse this. Not this.

279
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:59,243
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.

280
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,543
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.

281
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,143
"He can fix it."

282
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:33,245
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.

283
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:51,247
You got the new Harper's yet?

284
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,847
Now, you know stores down the way...

285
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:57,848
don't have nothing past Vibe
and Handguns Today.

286
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:00,648
Some titty mags, too, if you need.

287
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:02,948
All right. I got you.

288
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:06,048
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?

289
00:26:10,848 --> 00:26:13,749
Hey, boy. Told you I had something for you.

290
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,449
There you go.

291
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:17,949
That's my good boy.

292
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:10,554
Good day for a ship.

293
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,754
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.

294
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:21,255
Big Roy, let me have your card.

295
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,755
What do you want my card for?

296
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:27,555
Not you. Little Big Roy,
let me hold your card.

297
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,756
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.

298
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:33,455
-I'll work it for you.
-Work it for me?

299
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:37,256
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.

300
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,556
End of the week, you get paid.

301
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:55,958
Hey, Phil.

302
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:00,558
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.

303
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:02,759
I don't see no resemblance.

304
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:07,258
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?

305
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,961
Who's gonna work for me?

306
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:35,161
-A different look for our boy.
-Perry Ellis or something.

307
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:39,561
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking
motherfucker like you...

308
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:41,362
know the designer?

309
00:28:43,362 --> 00:28:45,062
Okay, I'm guessing.

310
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:48,762
It's a Joseph Abboud.

311
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,462
He puts dark buttons instead of brass
on his blazers.

312
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,462
That's the Abboud signature.

313
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:59,363
You know what they call a guy who pays
that much attention to his clothes, right?

314
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,863
A grown-up.

315
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:04,163
We're up.

316
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:08,264
-12-14, let's go.
-Copy, 1 1-34.

317
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:26,765
-That's a first.
-Sweat from a checker.

318
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:03,068
-You all right?
-Ready.

319
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:07,669
Maybe you ought to set up an easel
on the sidewalk...

320
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:10,569
-and do a sketch instead.
-I'm fine.

321
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:40,172
-Anything I ought to know?
-Yeah. Use the city.

322
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,272
Windows, mirrors, reflections,
anything like that.

323
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,573
Stay on my frequency, hear?

324
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:56,273
Vondopoulos should be coming out
of the garage on foot...

325
00:30:56,373 --> 00:30:58,473
-right about now.
-Copy that.

326
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:04,479
Beadie Russell. She wasn't much
when we started, you know.

327
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,479
But now she's got game.

328
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,682
Thank you.

329
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:27,887
1 2-14. I got him going into
a fifth floor room.

330
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:30,286
Note the number
then get down to the lobby.

331
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:33,087
-Wait on him there.
-Copy.

332
00:33:48,388 --> 00:33:51,688
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.

333
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:53,389
Copy.

334
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,589
-All this shit's going out to chassis?
-That's what they tell me.

335
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:10,590
We need a forklift. We're almost done here.

336
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:30,091
12-14. Vondopoulos and another man,
middle-aged, blue suit...

337
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:33,692
Ieaving the front door of the hotel.
They'rejust behind me. Copy?

338
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:34,792
Copy.

339
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:37,592
1 1-34.

340
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:41,692
Subject and companion, blue suit,
leaving the hotel any moment now.

341
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,793
Copy, we got the eyeball.

342
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:54,094
The man with Vondopoulos
has got to be big.

343
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:58,693
-I mean, look at that expensive suit.
-Yeah, with them buttons and all.

344
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:18,795
We leave the Benz here?

345
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:21,796
It's hot.

346
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:41,298
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?

347
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:42,597
Negative.

348
00:36:35,302 --> 00:36:38,503
-You about done?
-These nine here still got to be stripped.

349
00:36:38,603 --> 00:36:41,003
-Harder than it looks.
-What ain't?

350
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:47,203
-You hear how Moonshot got his name?
-Yeah, and I could give a fuck.

351
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:51,703
Who was the room registered to?

352
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:56,004
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.

353
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:59,504
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.

354
00:36:59,604 --> 00:37:03,204
We should run out the paper trail
on this guy, see what we turn up.

355
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:07,505
As to our only tangible piece of progress
from the raids...

356
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:10,306
what can we do for our friend White Mike?

357
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:14,306
He rolls on his suppliers,
and he can walk with a long probation.

358
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:17,906
-And we can move him, if he needs.
-Witness protection?

359
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:22,606
Why have the feds with you if they're
not gonna step up every now and then?

360
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:26,606
Wait a second. You're gonna give
a drug dealer a ride like that?

361
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:28,207
What about Frank Sobotka?

362
00:37:28,307 --> 00:37:30,707
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.

363
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:32,208
Or so they tell me.

364
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:35,307
The way I read it, they cared more
about busting up the union--

365
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:39,108
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?

366
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:43,308
You can't make him
any kind of specific offer yourself.

367
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:46,908
Only I can do that, and only after
I get an okay from my front office.

368
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:50,608
-She could plant the seed.
-There's no better messenger, Counselor.

369
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:54,609
Take a shot.

370
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:59,109
-You going to his house?
-The Union Hall. That's his house.

371
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,110
Thanks for waiting, Brucie. Sorry I'm late.

372
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,310
I shouldn't even be seen with you
at this point.

373
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,711
I just wanna settle our business
while we still can.

374
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,910
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands
on more cash, obviously.

375
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:12,911
The grain pier is dead.

376
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:18,011
Half the votes we had lined up
are walking sideways now.

377
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:19,611
They read the paper, Frank.

378
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:23,711
So what? So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?

379
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:26,312
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!

380
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:27,511
I'm not gonna lie.

381
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:31,213
No one is gonna stand with us
now that the FBI is on you.

382
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:33,512
-They're scared.
-Of what?

383
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,612
They took the money, Frank.

384
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:39,713
And now if they deliver the votes,
they figure the feds will be on them, too.

385
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:41,413
I'm sorry, Frank.

386
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:44,513
You find a way
of putting this FBI thing to bed...

387
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,313
maybe we can come back the next session
with the grain pier.

388
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:51,614
You'll have a couple of people down there
knowing they owe you a vote or two.

389
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:56,715
I don't know what else to say. I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.

390
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:02,615
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?

391
00:39:06,115 --> 00:39:09,215
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.

392
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,616
Now we just put our hand
in the next guy's pocket.

393
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:39,718
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something. Lamb or something.

394
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:41,618
I'm not hungry.

395
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,519
All this trouble.

396
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,219
-So, our associates, they are strong?
-Yes.

397
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,120
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.

398
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,320
If not, they will stand for us.

399
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,320
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.

400
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,421
We must make certain of this.

401
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,621
-Maybe there's another way.
-There is only one sure way.

402
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,021
Hear me out.

403
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,721
If I could guarantee
that Frank Sobotka and his nephew...

404
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:20,521
would be silent...

405
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:23,422
wouldn't you prefer that?

406
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,922
But you cannot guarantee this.

407
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:29,423
Frank's son,
the idiot who shot George in his store...

408
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:32,923
he is going to jail for a long time...

409
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,023
unless....

410
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:41,424
There was a young clerk wounded that day
in the store.

411
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:45,124
The prosecutors want to use him
as a witness.

412
00:40:45,324 --> 00:40:46,924
I know his family.

413
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:50,724
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.

414
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:54,925
If a man can have this,
why would he talk to the police?

415
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:57,224
What about Frank's nephew?

416
00:40:57,324 --> 00:41:00,625
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.

417
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,825
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.

418
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,325
You are fond of him, Spiros.

419
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:12,226
You should've had a son.

420
00:41:12,926 --> 00:41:15,226
But then I would've had a wife.

421
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:30,028
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight,
I'm gonna take it personal.

422
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:36,628
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.

423
00:41:39,828 --> 00:41:42,229
Where's a guy like that gonna run?

424
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,932
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha? Come on.

425
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:28,933
Nice and easy, honey.

426
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:31,733
-Come here.
-All right, come on, baby.

427
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,833
What's up, big man? Where the party at?

428
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,033
Ain't no party up in here, girl.

429
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:41,134
We thought Darnell and everybody
was gonna get their smoke on.

430
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,334
Don't you know Darnell?

431
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:45,834
What's this good boy's name?

432
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:47,435
Hey, boy.

433
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,834
How you doing today?

434
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,134
You been good? This a good boy.

435
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:56,235
-There it is.
-Car will be running.

436
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:02,936
What is it, Lamar?

437
00:43:11,236 --> 00:43:13,236
No need to prolong this.

438
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:15,636
No, we got time.

439
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:18,737
-You kill my man?
-No, he's resting.

440
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:26,838
-I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
-Not particularly.

441
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,137
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got
got here in Baltimore.

442
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:33,638
Stuck and burned before he passed.

443
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:37,338
-The game is the game.
-Indeed.

444
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,139
See, that boy was beautiful.

445
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:42,838
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him
the way y'all did.

446
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:44,339
You feel me?

447
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,939
-A year, you say?
-About that.

448
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,540
You've got some wrong information.

449
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,940
Man, you lying to live.

450
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
I'm at peace with my God.

451
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,540
Do what you will.

452
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:20,042
So you know?

453
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:24,342
What happened to your boy,
it's not my style.

454
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:34,943
The way you bleeding out your back,
looks like that bullet bore clean through.

455
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:38,944
9 mm at close range will do that.

456
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:51,445
Emergency. Do you need police
or ambulance?

457
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:54,345
I wanna report a shooting
over here at the new motel.

458
00:44:54,445 --> 00:44:57,745
-On North Avenue. Room 221 .
-Sir?

459
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,248
My pal, Beatrice.

460
00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:38,349
What, you gonna run me in again?
lsn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?

461
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:40,249
Stop it, just stop it.

462
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,749
-Talk to me.
-And say what?

463
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,650
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.

464
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,850
It didn't happen overnight.

465
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:07,851
I knew I was wrong.

466
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:13,052
But in my head, I thought I was wrong
for the right reasons, you know?

467
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:15,652
There are different kinds of wrong.

468
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:21,352
What're you doing here, Bea?

469
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:26,653
I'd like you to come in. Not in cuffs.

470
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:30,054
Because you want to.

471
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:33,754
I'm opening a door here, Frank.

472
00:46:43,154 --> 00:46:45,355
I can't promise you anything.

473
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:49,655
Just come in. We'll start from there.

474
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:58,355
You're better than them you got in bed with.

475
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:12,057
-Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
-Maybe he got lucky.

476
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:16,957
Maybe we didn't.

477
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:22,358
You think he ditched the Benz
because he picked up the tail?

478
00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:32,959
Nicky from the docks.

479
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:39,459
If you hadn't called last night,
I'd have never found you.

480
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:41,359
Relax, Niko, come on.

481
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,059
It's like I told you on the phone.

482
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:48,360
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.

483
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,060
I should have never gone down the road
with you people.

484
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,060
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.

485
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,260
There's no harm in that.

486
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:59,761
And you still have friends.

487
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:01,461
I'm busted.

488
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:06,761
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?

489
00:48:08,362 --> 00:48:10,662
-Christ!
-We will be a friend to him, too.

490
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:14,162
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.

491
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:19,262
Nothing is done, Niko. Nothing.

492
00:48:21,062 --> 00:48:22,263
Take a look.

493
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,163
That's not your name.

494
00:48:30,064 --> 00:48:32,064
Many names, many passports.

495
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:36,364
We can do many things.

496
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:44,364
What can you do for Ziggy?

497
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:50,265
We ask only loyalty.

498
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:07,966
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?

499
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:12,967
She asked me straight-up to come in,
so I'm here.

500
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:16,367
First, we need to know
what you're looking for.

501
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:19,268
We don't want any misunderstandings
later on.

502
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:23,768
I'm just looking for, you know,
some help with my son.

503
00:49:24,668 --> 00:49:28,468
-He can't jail where they got him.
-We move him to a county facility.

504
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:33,669
-What about my nephew?
-He gets arrested and charged.

505
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:36,269
But for his cooperation and yours...

506
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,669
we can live with straight probation.

507
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:44,570
But what we can and cannot do
for you and your family...

508
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:48,771
-depends on the level of your cooperation.
-You mean, how much I give you?

509
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,870
I got dirt on all of them.

510
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:56,371
I'll put myself in, too. Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.

511
00:49:56,471 --> 00:50:00,271
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.

512
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:02,672
I'll give you The Greek,
all them sons of bitches...

513
00:50:02,772 --> 00:50:06,072
just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.

514
00:50:06,272 --> 00:50:08,672
Mr. Sobotka, at this point
I have to advise you...

515
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,172
you need to retain
the services of an attorney.

516
00:50:11,272 --> 00:50:12,573
We're not gonna do this now?

517
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:14,573
You need to have a lawyer
present in the room.

518
00:50:14,773 --> 00:50:18,473
You have that, we can make this happen
first thing tomorrow.

519
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:29,774
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.

520
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:32,774
Why did you stop using your cell phone?

521
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:36,574
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?

522
00:52:02,382 --> 00:52:03,982
Under the bridge?

523
00:52:04,982 --> 00:52:08,783
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.

524
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:11,282
These guys,
they got a big operation to protect.

525
00:52:11,382 --> 00:52:12,983
They're global-like.

526
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:16,383
-They're really something?
-You got no idea.

527
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:19,683
I think I got a pretty clear picture
of what they're about.

528
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:25,083
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves
rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.

529
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,284
Heroin?

530
00:52:26,684 --> 00:52:29,784
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!

531
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:33,284
You ain't much more than a kid.

532
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:39,285
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?

533
00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:44,286
I flushed my fucking family, for what?

534
00:52:47,185 --> 00:52:49,786
You know what that is, Nicky? Do you?

535
00:52:52,486 --> 00:52:53,986
A condominium.

536
00:53:00,187 --> 00:53:01,787
I ain't going down there.

537
00:53:01,987 --> 00:53:05,387
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.

538
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:08,887
That's right. I'm gonna do
to those cocksuckers what they did to me.

539
00:53:08,987 --> 00:53:11,088
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

540
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:15,188
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.

541
00:53:16,888 --> 00:53:18,588
They can lean on that witness...

542
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:21,789
that kid that he shot,
the one that was there in the store.

543
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:24,288
The kid's gonna say that
Double G had the gun.

544
00:53:24,388 --> 00:53:27,189
That it was like self-defense or some shit.

545
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:31,290
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.

546
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:33,390
He could.

547
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:37,990
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.

548
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,390
-And for that they want what?
-Loyalty.

549
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,391
Motherfuckers!

550
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,993
I'll hear them out.

551
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:19,393
-All right, I'll drive.
-No, it's just me.

552
00:54:20,794 --> 00:54:22,994
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.

553
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:27,294
-Uncle Frank, me and Spiros--
-I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!

554
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:29,694
Go home!

555
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:44,706
Your way...

556
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:47,406
it won't work.
