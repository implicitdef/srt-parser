00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,997
This is the Persian empire...

3
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,374
...known today as Iran.

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,337
For 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...

5
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,048
...known as shahs.

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,720
ln 1 950, the people of Iran elected
Mohammad Mosaddegh...

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,264
...a secular democrat, as prime minister.

8
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,685
He nationalized British and U.S.
petroleum holdings...

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,813
...returning Iran's oil to its people.

10
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,775
But in 1953...

11
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:12,571
...the U.S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup d'état that deposed Mosaddegh....

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,741
...and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,496
The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.

14
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,540
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...

15
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,628
...while the shah had his lunches
flown in by Concorde from Paris.

16
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,464
The people starved.

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,969
The shah kept power through his ruthless
internal police:

18
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,888
The SAVAK.

19
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,642
An era of torture and fear began.

20
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,314
He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...

21
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:52,111
...enraging a mostly traditional Shiite
population.

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,074
ln 1 979, the people of Iran
overthrew the shah.

23
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:03,205
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.

24
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:11,171
lt descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.

25
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:18,137
Dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the U.S.

26
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,725
The Iranian people took to the streets
outside the U.S. embassy...

27
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,478
...demanding that the shah be returned...

28
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,980
...tried...

29
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,274
...and hanged.

30
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,278
Based on a true story.

31
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,323
U.S. Embassy, Iran - November 4, 1979

32
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,471
The carnival's a little bigger today, huh?

33
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,934
Windows are supposed to be
bulletproof, right?

34
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,144
Well, they've never been tested.

35
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,774
You just need to finish
filling out this section here.

36
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,734
We can process your visa.

37
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,121
We need some security.
Yes, it's your responsibility.

38
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,497
They're over the walls.

39
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,417
We should all split.
l'm gonna close up my office.

40
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,396
Oh, my God.

41
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,524
Marines to Number One. Fall back.

42
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,194
-Can anyone hear me? We need help.
-l need police right now. Right now, goddamn it!

43
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,030
- Jesus.
- Can anybody hear me?

44
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,032
There was a breach.

45
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,868
Just burn everything! Burn it now!

46
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,787
All right, burn everything!
All the files, file cabinet, safe.

47
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,846
Let's get a cart over here. Burn it all.
Come on.

48
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,891
Burn everything!
Burn the classifieds! Everything!

49
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,105
Don't fucking shoot anybody.

50
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,983
You don't wanna be the son of a bitch
who started a war.

51
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,943
They need an hour to burn the classified.

52
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,987
l need you to hold.

53
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:08,200
lf you shoot one person, they're gonna kill
every single one of us in here.

54
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,087
l'm telling you,
if we're going to go, we need to go now.

55
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,840
-Okay, we need to make a decision--
-Can we wait until the Iranian police come?

56
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,468
No, the police aren't coming.
lt's been 45 minutes.

57
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,638
-How do you know?
-The police have abandoned their posts.

58
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,140
lf the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.

59
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,643
The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

60
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,980
The prime minister may come tomorrow, but the
Komiteh are here today. So we have to evacuate.

61
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,233
Look at me. No one is coming.

62
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,445
Get the desk drawers. Everything.
Don't sort it.

63
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,948
Get it down to the incinerator in the vault!
Go, now!

64
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,033
Tear gas as a last resort only.

65
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,536
only if your life is under threat.

66
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,118
ln here, we are in America right now.
Outside, we are in Iran.

67
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,787
lt's on American soil--
- l'm not going out into that.

68
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,205
They're not safe here.

69
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,333
lf they get caught applying for visas
to the U.S.?

70
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,420
Mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.

71
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,339
-lf we're going to go, then we need to go now.
-Yeah, l'm in.

72
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,924
-Yeah.
-Yeah, let's go.

73
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,056
-l'm going outside.
-Why?

74
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,683
To reason with them.

75
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,421
Open the door!

76
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,298
Open the fucking door!

77
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,011
You said you wanted to see the world,
right, Tom?

78
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,263
Let me in! Let me in!

79
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,731
Burn it all. Come on.

80
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,651
Get the safe, get the filing cabinets,
get it all.

81
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,577
All four drawers,
l want them shredded right now.

82
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,538
Not gonna shred fast enough.

83
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,249
Grab the visa plates!

84
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,877
All four! And anything else
you see out there.

85
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,837
When in doubt, just shred it!

86
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,968
We got 1 0 minutes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Everything!

87
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,520
Get the shredder.

88
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,230
There are no police.

89
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,071
Jesus.

90
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,033
Leave the building, go now.

91
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,286
Iranians go first.

92
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,079
Now, hurry!

93
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,511
Who has made this?!

94
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,477
lt's done. They're in.

95
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,131
Okay, come on.
We gotta get off the streets.

96
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,841
This way. Up here to the left.

97
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,539
-These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
-Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

98
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,708
-These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
-Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

100
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,961

STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

101
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,295
You think the Soviets would put up
with this shit? They'd invade.

102
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,048
We helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.

103
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,425
-How many were there?
-At least 50. We're not sure.

104
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,636
- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?

105
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,680
No, l was screaming his name
because l was fucking him.

00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,074
Yes. ls White House joining?

119
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,826
They claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.

120
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,576
We wish it was.

121
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,452
We wish it was.

128
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,379
They're sticking.
No release till we expel the shah.

129
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,590
-Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
-He's half-dead and he's in chemo.

130
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,175
We took him in. He's ours now.

131
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,803
Great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

132
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,513
No, just the pricks on our side.

133
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,225
So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...

134
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,562
...they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

135
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,231
What about the six
who are with the Canadians?

136
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,276
We've got 60 in the embassy with guns
to their heads right now.

137
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,237
The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.

138
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,573
Banisadr's saying it'll be over
in 24 hours.

139
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,662
We leave the six where they are.
l'll go brief the president.

140
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,083
All right, let's get to it.

141
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,754
So far official comments about
the incident have been a model of restraint.

142
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,892
69 DAYS LATER

143
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,449
Iran's Revolutionary Guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists...

144
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,120
...blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.

145
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,041
It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been tightened.

146
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,879
This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.

147
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,089
There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.

148
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,053
ln this country, George Meany died
last night. He was 85 years old.

149
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,515
Yeah.

150
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,184
Yes.

151
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,646
What?

152
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,815
To begin with, of course...

153
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,652
...we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the American embassy compound.

154
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,197
They may not understand what
their ordeal means to their countrymen.

155
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,658
But this nation, their nation, is outraged.

156
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:47,450
And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.

157
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,286
And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIA

158
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,288
And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.

159
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,918
Actions of Iran
have shocked the civilized world.

160
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,879
Our embassy has been seized...

161
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:05,051
...and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.

162
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,222
The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.

163
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,600
NBC's situation in Iran has changed,
however.

164
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,357
-ls he back there?
-Office.

165
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,280
What happened?

166
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,241
The six of them went out a back exit.

167
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,910
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

168
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,787
Canadians took them in.

169
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,998
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

170
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,293
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.

171
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,670
-Why didn't we get them 1 0 weeks ago?
-Too dangerous.

172
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,299
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

173
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,760
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

174
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,387
What about the White House?

175
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,181
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

176
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,391
The Canadians are done.

177
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,228
They say they're bearing too much risk. Their
foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels. ..

178
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,939
...and told him she wants
the six of them out.

179
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,650
-Who else knows?
-Just the families.

180
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,528
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book. ..

181
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,573
-...on everybody who worked there.
-Jesus Christ.

182
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,909
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

183
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:15,121
But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.

184
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,000
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

185
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,752
And they'll know what they look like.

186
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,296
Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.

187
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,050
-Who's handling?
-State is coordinating in-house.

188
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,344
State?

189
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,804
-They don't do exfils.
-They do now.

190
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,432
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

191
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,643
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

192
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,521
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

193
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,690
State wants the blame, we'll give it to them.

194
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,485
What does he want me here for?

195
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,446
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

196
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,454
Okay.

197
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,374
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

198
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,417
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

199
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,962
-Bob?
-Thank you.

200
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,797
All right.

201
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,840
Mark and Cora Lijek.

202
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,427
Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular officer,
she's an assistant.

203
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,014
Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.

204
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,310
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

205
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,855
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attaché from ldaho.

206
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,816
A bit of an oddball, apparently.

207
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,194
He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.

208
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,947
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

209
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,991
He's smart and a climber.

210
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,242
Speaks Farsi.

211
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,245
He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.

212
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,707
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

213
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,418
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

214
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,170
...oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.

215
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,215
They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.

216
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,177
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

217
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,432
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

218
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,227
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

219
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,730
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains.. .

220
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,189
...to the crossing near Tabriz.

221
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,234
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

222
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,944
We wait till the weather clears up.. .

223
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,489
...then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.

224
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,284
We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.

225
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,412
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

226
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,423
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

227
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,050
Tony.

228
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,218
lt's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

229
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,804
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

230
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,348
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

231
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,892
State is handling the op.

232
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,310
l'm sorry, who is this?

233
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,898
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

234
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,650
Sir, if these people can read or add.. .

235
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,862
...pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

236
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,033
lt's winter. You can't afford to wait around till
spring so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.

237
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,787
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them. ..

238
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,915
...you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

239
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,918
- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.

240
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,629
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

241
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,839
-The government issued 70-something...
-Seventy-four.

242
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,591
...visas for American journalists.

243
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,760
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

244
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,806
lf they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.

245
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,100
North American accents
gives us limited options.

246
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,268
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

247
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,854
What about English teachers
at the international school?

248
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,690
lt's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.

249
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,484
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

250
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,781
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.

251
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,492
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

252
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,787
lt's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

253
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,622
Those kids are black.

254
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,499
Those are African kids.

255
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,877
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

256
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,713
l'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so.. ..

257
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,716
What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

258
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,926
Hold on.

259
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,638
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

260
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,891
What's in this picture?

261
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,310
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

262
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,148
- Snow.
- Right.

263
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,568
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

264
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,323
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

265
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,159
You don't wanna need one.. .

266
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,162
...but when you do, you don't do it yourself.

267
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,751
You have a better plan?

268
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,171
No, sir.

269
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,302
Whatever
the conflicting signals from Iran today...

270
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,887
...and for that matter, every day...

271
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,098
...about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...

272
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,977
...the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:

273
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,271
The hostages must be freed.

274
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,274
--claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them.. .

275
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,194
...it violates them for all nations.

276
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,570
We demand extradition...

277
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,196
We demand extradition...
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

278
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:58,362
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

279
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,450
...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

280
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:02,742
...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...

281
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,495
...has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.

282
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,374
He said if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages...

283
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,253
...the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.

284
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,382
Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.

285
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,385
Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.

286
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,304
An Iranian flag was burned...

287
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,308
...when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.

288
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,728
--also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians....

289
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,773
They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.

290
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,442
But l don't understand
what they should do now.

291
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,195
Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?

292
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,739
l don't think that justice is the worst thing.

293
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,700
When did people first tell you that torture
was going on in Iran?

294
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,788
They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow."

295
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,708
President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, lmam--

296
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,211
Forgive me, his words, not mine.

297
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,545
--a lunatic.

298
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,715
Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

299
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,217
He would've been referred to as a barbarian.

300
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,095
That's why they're saying
that their current regime.. ..

301
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,721
The shah did more for women's rights--

302
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,016
l think you'd better--
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

303
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,412
At one point,
the mob cornered one of the Iranians.

304
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,999
When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.

305
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,959
Just hit him again!

306
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,629
We're not gonna take it anymore!
We're sick of it!

307
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,048
America!

308
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:46,846
Even in our little community here, l mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.

309
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,058
They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.

310
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,437
Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.

311
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,773
Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.

312
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,025
l'm mad as hell.

313
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:03,946
I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in Network, you know? l've had it.

314
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,700
And if need be, l'll bear arms again.

315
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,495
And that's the way it is
Wednesday, January 1 6th, 1 980.

316
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,916
The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.

317
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,427
- Hello?
- Buddy man.

318
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,054
l'll get Mom.

319
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,722
l'm looking for you.

320
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,184
Did you do your homework tonight?

321
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,103
-Yeah, it was easy.
-Excellent. What are we watching?

322
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,356
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

323
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,857
Tell me, what channel is it on?

324
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,275
Five.

325
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,364
All right.

326
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,535
-What'd you do at school today?
-Nothing. l don't know. Nothing.

327
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,956
Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

328
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,958
After school l got some baseball cards.

329
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,543
-Mm-hm.
-That was fun.

330
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,021
Okay, you know those
science-fiction movies?

331
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,816
Star Trek, Star Wars.
They need an exotic location to shoot.

332
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,443
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

333
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,903
Now, imagine this:

334
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,325
They're a Canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.

335
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,993
We put it out there--

336
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,954
The Canadian producers put it out there.

337
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,747
--that we're looking at Egypt, lstanbul.

338
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,420
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too."

339
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:47,133
l fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.

340
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,511
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

341
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,722
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

342
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,392
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

343
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,270
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

344
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,272
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

345
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,232
-No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
-Chambers.

346
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,526
John Chambers.
He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

347
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,655
He's got an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes.
Did a bunch of contract work for us in the past.

348
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,451
l go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

349
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,636
l went outside for 30 seconds. Could you
give me a break? l can't breathe in this house.

350
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,806
- l need some fresh air. l can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

351
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,809
-Who saw me go outside? l'm just curious.
-That's not the point, Bob.

352
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,228
-lt doesn't matter who saw you go out.
-Did you see me?

353
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,731
-No.
-l did, okay? l saw you.

354
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,901
Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.

355
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,908
Sοme Americans are missing.

356
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,243
Lοοk at the repaired list οf embassy emplοyees.

357
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,330
Τhe numbers dοn't match.

358
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,416
Finish assembling the pictures frοm the embassy.

359
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,127
All l need is their faces and l will find them.

360
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,046
Yes, sir, it will be dοne.

361
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,768
We want you to go to L.A.

362
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,396
lf you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.

363
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,273
Don't fuck up.

364
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,901
The whole country is watching you.

365
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,153
They just don't know it.

366
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,578
My creation.

367
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,748
My creation.

368
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,089
What the fuck, Brian?

369
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,465
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

370
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,842
What an idiot.
lt really hurt.

371
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,219
l'm sorry.

372
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,347
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

373
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,311
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

374
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:14,071
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

375
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,991
lf he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.

376
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,582
Mr. Chambers?

377
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,667
Kevin Harkins.

378
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,962
Hey, Tony.

379
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,279
Watch your head.

380
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,364
What are you shooting?

381
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,408
Monster movie.

382
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,577
Yeah? Any good?

383
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,039
Target audience will hate it.

384
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,707
Who's the target audience?

385
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,459
People with eyes.

386
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,379
Talk to me.

387
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,716
lt's an exfil.

388
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,051
From where?

389
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,637
Worst place you can think of.

390
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,180
Universal City.

391
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,730
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

392
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,233
They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.

393
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,235
They're hiding out in Tehran.

394
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,697
-And that's who l'm gonna go get.
-What am l making?

395
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,575
l need you to help me make a fake movie.

396
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,244
Heh. You came to the right place.

397
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,581
l wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

398
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,750
-That we're not gonna make.
-No.

399
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,670
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

400
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,797
-Without actually doing anything?
-No.

401
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,548
You'll fit right in.

402
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,931
Let's see.

403
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,976
Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.

404
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,063
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

405
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,940
Here's your director.

406
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,275
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

407
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,778
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

408
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,782
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

409
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,243
The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins...

410
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,620
...who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.

411
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,749
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

412
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,085
You need a script. You need a producer.

413
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,420
-Make me a producer.
-No.

414
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,923
You're an associate producer at best.

415
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,635
lf you're gonna do a $20 million
Star Wars rip-off.. .

416
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,639
...you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.

417
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,725
Somebody respectable.

418
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,144
With credits.

419
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,814
Who you can trust
with classified information.

420
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,025
Who'll produce a fake movie.

421
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,069
For free.

422
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,170
Hi. l only got a couple of minutes.
l'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

423
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,921
- Mazel tov, Lester.
- Ah.

424
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,591
l'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

425
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,846
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

426
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,683
...all of whom chant "Death to America"
all the livelong day.

427
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,435
You want to set up a movie in a week.

428
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,022
You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.

429
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,691
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here. ..

430
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,361
...into a country that wants ClA blood
on their breakfast cereal. ..

431
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,032
...and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

432
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,951
Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

433
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,871
Right.

434
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,374
Look, l gotta tell you.

435
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,504
We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.

436
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,130
Sir, the car is here.

437
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,808
You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?

438
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,019
Well, they're getting the ratings,
l'll say that for--

439
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,825
We're gonna need a script.

440
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,919
Here, come on, come on, come on.

441
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,254
-No, it's fine.
-Stop.

442
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,594
Okay.

443
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,856
l love you.

444
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,784
Sahar, how are you doing?

445
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,245
Fine, thank you.

446
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,707
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

447
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,544
All this time. They never go out.

448
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,642
Sahar knows.

449
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,440
How about The Horses of Achilles?

450
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,067
No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.

451
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,405
-lt's ancient Troy.
-lf it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

452
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,615
Hey, Kenny, please.

453
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,159
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

454
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,786
lt doesn't matter. lt's a fake movie.

455
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,457
lf l'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

456
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,252
The cardinal wants
all cover options on his desk Friday morning.

457
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,672
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.

458
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,134
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

459
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,844
Fine.

460
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,456
Hey, is A006 still on the open list?

461
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,124
Yeah, l'll hold.

462
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,629
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.

463
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,549
Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

464
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,178
Argo. A science-fantasy adventure."

465
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,556
-lt's in turnaround. lt's dog shit.
-lt's a space movie in the Middle East.

466
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,350
-Does it matter?
-Can we get the option?

467
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,019
Why do we need the option?

468
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:05,065
You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.

469
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,318
Just let me do the talking.

470
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,738
l've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard...

471
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,573
...but l can handle him.

472
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,036
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

473
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,830
Up like a carny ride.

474
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,039
One month, yeah.

475
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,583
-Who are you again?
-Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

476
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,127
He's the money.

477
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:30,382
Look, what do you say 1 5 thou
and let's close on this?

478
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,094
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

479
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,722
No. l would like you to bullshit me, Max.

480
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,390
All right.

481
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,268
l enjoyed your films. The early ones.

482
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,564
l took this meeting out of respect,
because l wanted to say no to your face.

483
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,608
Thank you. Very respectful.

484
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,277
You're finished, Lester.

485
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,696
Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.

486
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,450
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

487
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,077
They're screaming for sci-fi.

488
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,456
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

489
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,419
Well, what can l say?

490
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,212
Congratulations.

491
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,925
But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.

492
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,847
Couple of weeks ago, l was sitting at
Trader Vic's, l was enjoying a Mai Tai...

493
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,724
...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

494
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,976
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

495
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,438
Seems he was attached
to star in Zulu Empire...

496
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,815
...which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

497
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,069
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

498
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,155
...because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

499
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,908
They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental.. .

500
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,367
...so the movie's kaput.

501
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,746
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

502
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,749
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

503
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,168
So the way it looks to me--

504
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,170
Through the cataracts, l grant you.

505
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,130
--is that you can either sign here...

506
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,300
...and take $1 0,000
for your toilet paper script.. .

507
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,677
...or you can go fuck yourself.

508
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,597
With all due respect.

509
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,438
You really know Warren Beatty?

510
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,359
Yes, l do. l took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.

511
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,319
Taco?

512
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,839
Got any kids, Lester?

513
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,050
Yeah. l have two daughters.

514
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,719
You see them much?

515
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,805
l talk to them once a year.

516
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,933
-Maybe.
-Why is that?

517
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,438
l was a terrible father.

518
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,527
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

519
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,989
You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.

520
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,242
You?

521
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,078
Yeah, l got a son.

522
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,456
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

523
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,045
You're divorced?

524
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,047
Taking time off.

525
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,260
He needs to be, you know. ..

526
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,469
...where he is.

527
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,932
Kids need the mother.

528
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,319
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

529
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,448
Listen.

530
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,993
Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.

531
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,079
Thorough background examinations
should be expected.

532
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,458
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
l need another week, Jack.

533
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,752
You don't have it.

534
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,796
We got an office.

535
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,883
We got business cards.

536
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,885
We got a poster.

537
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,097
lf l'm the Revolutionary Guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.

538
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,225
Six people's lives depend on this.

539
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,647
lt's not enough. lf we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.

540
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,816
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

541
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,987
l did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

542
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,282
lf you wanna sell a lie... .

543
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,827
You get the press to sell it for you.

544
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,540
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

545
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:36,670
Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.

546
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,672
They have costumes and everything.

547
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,592
No, no, no, l can't.
Variety has an exclusive on that.

548
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,929
ls there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?

549
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,181
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

550
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,432
Iran.

551
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,186
Look, l can get you in, but you're
gonna have to promise me at least half a page.

552
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,481
No, no, this thing's an event.
lt's gonna be a spectacle.

553
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,172
Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

554
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,423
You're doing the reading?

555
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,759
l'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

556
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,886
Great. l'll call you.

557
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,931
Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.

558
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,434
-You know her?
-l was married to her.

559
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,269
Oh, my God, lraq is amazing.

560
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,562
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

561
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,147
Iran with an N?

562
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,899
Yeah. We're very excited.

563
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,359
You ever watch the news?

564
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,277
What does the title refer to?

565
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,614
The Argo. You know, it's the thing.

566
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,532
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece,
or what?

567
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,618
No, no. lt's the ship. lt's the spaceship.

568
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:36,623
lt goes everywhere.
lt goes all throughout space.

569
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,416
So it's the Argonaut.

570
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,085
No.

571
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,379
-What does "Argo" mean?
-l don't know.

572
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,630
You don't know?

573
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,257
lt means "Argo fuck yourself."

574
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,096
Excuse me. May l have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

575
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:55,809
lf our artists could settle in.
We're just about ready to begin the reading.

576
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,729
Argo, by Mary Ann Boyd.

577
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,107
"Fade in on starship landing.

578
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,817
Exterior, bazaar.

579
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,820
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

580
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,664
The people working here are not diplomats.

581
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,291
ln fact, as lmam Khomeini said...

582
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:24,337
...we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.

583
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,008
All evidence proves
that these people are spies.

584
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,846
ln the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful...

585
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,640
...our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:

586
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,518
At this time we want
to expose the hateful acts. ...

587
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,854
Our world has changed.

588
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,274
The fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

589
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,526
The ship is turning around.

590
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,194
Fire the thrusters!

591
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,780
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill anyone.

592
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,324
were completely unjustified.

593
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,160
They and all others must know...

594
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,872
...that the United States of America
will not yield...

595
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,749
...to international terrorism or to blackmail.

596
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,628
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

597
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,882
--are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.

598
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,552
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists.. .

599
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,557
...but itself and its ClA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

600
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,518
"The story was told,
but there are infinitely more.

601
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,563
Three setting suns.
The princess's robes fall from her body."

602
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,566
lf we find his ship
we will find our chance.

603
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,362
Aboard the Argo lies
my hope, my hero, my husband.

604
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,908
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

605
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,953
You wonder where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.

606
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,078
You wonder where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

607
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,245
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

608
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:43,041
What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

609
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:43,708
What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"

610
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,544
The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.

611
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,923
--Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.

612
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,344
Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.

613
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,553
For life?

614
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,098
They will remain until the shah is returned.

615
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,894
But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital...

616
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,231
...leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran...

617
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,608
...harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.

618
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,534
"We cut outside to the Shidoori Dome...

619
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,536
...holding on a single red flower...

620
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,122
...as it grows from the ruins
of a starship in the desert.

621
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,918
Fade to black." The end.

622
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,926
There is it. What'd l tell you?

623
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,053
First shot of the picture.

624
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,642
Argo fuck yourself.

625
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,228
Argo fuck yourself.

626
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,835
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

627
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,628
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

628
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:26,769
Brace yourself. lt's like talking to
those two old fucks on The Muppets.

629
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,524
Aliens and robots?

630
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,444
Yes, sir.

631
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,323
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now...

632
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,283
...that is funded by the ClA?

633
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,076
Yes, sir.

634
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,998
-What's wrong with the bikes again?
-We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

635
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,792
You think this is more plausible
than teachers?

636
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,338
Yes, we do.
One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.

637
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,715
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.

638
00:43:55,924 --> 00:44:00,428
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad
with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

639
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,889
There are only bad options.

640
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,557
lt's about finding the best one.

641
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,560
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

642
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,480
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

643
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,689
By far.

644
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,993
The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

645
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,162
Thank you, sir.

646
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:07,537
l'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

647
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,373
Barely claim me as it is.

648
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,293
Your "in case of's" good?

649
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,879
lt's just Christine.

650
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,759
l should've brought some books
to read in prison.

651
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,969
No.

652
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,638
They'll kill you long before prison.

653
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,808
-Thanks for the ride.
-Yeah.

654
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,153
Studio Six.

655
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,573
We got a green light. Keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.

656
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,034
Argo fuck yourself.

657
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,513
Your attention, please.

658
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,184
This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.

659
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,218
"We are a nation of 35 million.

660
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:50,389
And many of these people are looking
forward to martyrdom."

661
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,895
-Hey.
-Hey.

662
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,980
Come to bed.

663
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,149
ln five minutes.

664
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,372
You know, she pleaded with me.

665
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,376
When it started in the streets
nine months ago...

666
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,921
...she begged for us to leave.

667
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,925
She packed our bags, and l said:

668
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,262
"You know what?
You know, just a little bit longer."

669
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,683
And all l was thinking was:

670
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,395
"Stay.

671
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,189
This is good for me.

672
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,775
Stay.

673
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,446
Show Newsom you got the balls."

674
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,122
l can't believe l put Kathy in this position.

675
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,049
l think we're gonna die here.

676
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:38,122
ISTANBUL, TURKEY - JANUARY 27, 1980

677
00:48:56,558 --> 00:49:00,978
"Iran is 1 00 percent
not in a prerevolutionary state."

678
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,190
ClA brief, November 1 st, 1 979.

679
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,359
Can't be right all the time.

680
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,027
Kevin.

681
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,737
When'd you get back?

682
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,157
The shah escaped in a 747.. .

683
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,702
...so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it off the runway.

684
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,912
But you kept busy.

685
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,125
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

686
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,086
lt's getting worse.

687
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,214
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

688
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,260
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

689
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,971
When you leave, they match them up. ..

690
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,515
...to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

691
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,644
So if they look, they'll see l didn't come
into the country with six people.

692
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,146
lf they look.

693
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:51,195
When you land, you should go straight to
the Ministry of Culture and lslamic Guidance...

694
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,822
...to kiss the ring.

695
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,200
Get on record as having applied
for a film permit.

696
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,121
lf they catch you later, at least they'll be
confused while they're torturing you.

697
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:08,045
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

698
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,974
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

699
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,477
Uh, film production. Business.

700
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,649
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

701
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,863
l would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till l got here.

702
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:38,117
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.

703
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,807
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

704
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:05,311
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

705
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,271
Somebody with one of the families talked.

706
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,814
Mother of God.

707
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,776
Yeah, l just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

708
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,403
He thinks he can
get them to sit on it, for now.

709
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,364
Your guy better get them...

710
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,909
...and get the hell out.

711
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,662
The captain has informed
us that we have entered Iranian airspace.

712
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,334
We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.

713
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,202
This film crew is just yourself?

714
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,705
No, we have six more from Canada
meeting us today.

715
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,707
You like to film at the bazaar?

716
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,043
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

717
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,504
Landmark sites.

718
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,297
l see.

719
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,967
The exotic Orient.

720
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,762
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

721
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,557
You came to us at a complicated time.

722
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,728
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

723
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,147
l understand.

724
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,484
The function of this office is purification.. .

725
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,946
...as well as promotion for the arts.

726
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,825
l'll review this for the minister.

727
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,994
Okay. Thank you.

728
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,213
Lester, you're working late.

729
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,299
Till the dawn's early light.

730
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,344
You got stamina, Lester. l wanna be you.

731
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,389
Well, l'm 1 50 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.

732
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,484
Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

733
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,153
Thank you for what you're doing.

734
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,781
l was expecting more of a G-man look.

735
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,868
l think you're thinking of the FBl, sir.

736
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,996
Ah. This way.

737
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,845
-These are blank, you know. Stamps.. ..
-Yeah, l'll take care of this.

738
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,182
How long?

739
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,185
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

740
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,686
And you'll fly out with them?

741
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,730
Yeah.

742
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,565
There's something you should know.

743
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,027
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

744
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:10,032
We don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.

745
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,208
Hi.

746
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,252
My name's Kevin Harkins. ..

747
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,921
...and l'm gonna get you home.

748
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,008
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

749
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,096
lt's theater of the absurd.

750
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,849
-What are our chances?
-Your chances are good.

751
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,144
"Good"? Well, what's the number value
of "good"?

752
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,063
Thirty percent chance
of being publicly executed?

753
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,775
Can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?

754
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,153
There are no Canadians in the country
for normal reasons.

755
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,863
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

756
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,700
They accused him of being an American
at the airport. They held him for an hour.

757
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,911
We can't hold up under that.
We don't know what the hell movie people do.

758
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,204
That's why l'm here.

759
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,875
l'm gonna help you. l'll be with you
the whole way. This is what l do.

760
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,085
Have you gotten people out
this way before?

761
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,921
This would be a first.

762
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,010
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

763
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,679
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads. ..

764
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,599
...just for having American names
in their phone books.

765
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,225
You've been here an hour.

766
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,811
And you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, Mr. ..?

767
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,313
Harkins.

768
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,315
That's your real name?

769
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,150
No.

770
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:14,907
l know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

771
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,117
But it is time to go.

772
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,207
We've got orders to close the embassy
and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.

773
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,421
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. l'm serious.

774
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,509
No, no, no, this is what, the part when
we say this is so crazy it might actually work?

775
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,511
Joe, l saw it in Burma. They get people out.

776
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,931
Snitches in banana republics?
They get them over the border after the coup.

777
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,140
That's your opinion, Joe.

778
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,476
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

779
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:47,105
lf we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

780
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,816
-You got a problem lying, Joe?
-Point is, we can't stay here.

781
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,112
lf we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

782
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,865
Pat and l have discussed it.
lt's the risk we took.

783
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,577
That man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.

784
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:04,039
And if he loses, it's our lives.

785
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,334
And his life too.

786
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,671
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

787
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,047
We gotta go.

788
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,015
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

789
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,726
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

790
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,813
Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.

791
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,064
And then add to that.

792
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,651
Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?

793
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,986
The only way this works. ..

794
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,823
...is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you dream like them.

795
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,492
Get started tonight.

796
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,204
l'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

797
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,503
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

798
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,046
What's your name?

799
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,049
Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.

800
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,051
That was convincing.

801
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,886
Kathy, what's your name?

802
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,084
The Love Boat
will be seen 1 5 minutes from now.

803
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:35,047
The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...

804
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:39,301
...will not divert the attention of the
United States from the plight of the hostages.

805
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,179
--is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant....

806
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,850
Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...

807
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,853
...over that country's invasion
of Afghanistan....

808
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,481
The United States
is now moving toward a decision...

809
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,691
...to boycott the Summer Olympics
in Moscow....

810
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,071
Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.

811
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,575
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

812
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,732
"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.

813
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,818
He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew.. .

814
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,571
...at the Khayyam entrance
to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m."

815
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,615
They called your bluff.

816
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,368
-Maybe they're cooperating.
-Absolutely not.

817
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:51,164
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. lt's the hive.

818
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,666
Seven Canadians, Jack.

819
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,961
Never give them multiple shots at a cover.

820
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,963
Are they even ready?

821
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,381
They're getting there.

822
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,091
There's no prize for "Most lmproved."

823
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,969
l don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence...

824
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,763
...and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up. ..

825
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,765
...when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?

826
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,789
You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

827
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,877
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

828
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,670
They suspect something?

829
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,590
What l know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.

830
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,177
We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.

831
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,680
We won't do it.

832
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,185
He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.

833
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,562
lt would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.

834
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,856
What else do we have to do, all right?

835
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,567
He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding. ..

836
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,404
-...which is that they don't know we're here!
-That's the ball game, okay?

837
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,698
Look, we don't have any other choice!

838
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,201
Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?

839
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,119
We're not in the ClA.

840
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,872
lt's suicide.

841
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,124
l'm asking you to trust me.

842
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,710
l don't trust you.

843
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,799
This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?

844
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,594
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.

845
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,847
lt's too dangerous.
l won't bring my wife into the bazaar.

846
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,267
Joe?

847
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,818
So we'll see you at 2.

848
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,762
So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.

849
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,474
l haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

850
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,353
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

851
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,690
Sorry. Okay.

852
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:31,783
Hello?

853
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,958
Who was that?

854
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,005
-Mark?
-Yeah?

855
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,884
l'm scared.

856
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,470
lt's okay.

857
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,519
Where are they?

858
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,021
ln the kitchen.

859
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,416
This is what l do. l get people out.

860
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,754
And l've never left anyone behind.

861
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,800
l wish l could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

862
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,225

You play along with me today,
l promise you, l will get you out tomorrow.

866
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,868
Fuck.

867
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,327
Shit.

868
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,856
Hang on.

869
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,656
You all right?

870
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,080
Okay. Tell me who you are.

871
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,041

01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,208
ls this film a foreign-bride film?

885
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,419
Sorry?

886
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,046
A film where a foreign bride comes to Iran. ..

887
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:40,758
...but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs...

888
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,469
...and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.

889
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,096
Oh, no.

890
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:55,773
The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.

891
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:00,528
This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

892
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,908
You can find many items
such as paper, spices.. .

893
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,619
...precious metals, all right here.

894
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:08,995
Right this way, please.

895
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,752
This way.

896
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,143
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

897
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,481
lf l was to say you're looking through the
wrong end of that viewfinder, would l be right?

898
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,360
Yup.

899
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,701
Just a little further.

900
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,943
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

901
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,503
He wants the photograph you took.

902
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,756
lt's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.

903
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:47,176
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

904
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:50,013
That's okay. You can tell him he can have it.

905
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,391
Please, please, just take the photograph.

906
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,235
Peace be upοn yοu.

907

01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:12,952
Sahar.

912
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:27,133
He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.

913
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,187
No, no, no! No! Canada!

914
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,396
Canada!

915
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,857
l would like to suggest that we end our visit.

916
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,284
Yοu knοw, sister...

917
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:57,455
...thοse whο are with him, Rasοοl οf Allah,
we are tender amοng οurselves.

918
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,165
But stern against the Kufar.

919
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,209
As Gοd wills it.

920
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:06,047
But thοse whο sit silently have sinned.

921
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,509
Hοw else may l help, sir?

922
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,011
Nο, nο, just οne thing.

923
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,515
Hοw lοng have they been here?

924
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,809
Pardοn?

925
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,853
The guests of the Ambassador.

926
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,230
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

927
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,692
Τhey arrived twο days agο.

928
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:32,198
Fοrgive my intrusiοn, οne must be vigilant.

929
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,369
Everyοne in this hοuse is a friend οf Iran.

930
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,363
How'd it go?

931
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,616
What about tomorrow?

932
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,494
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

933
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,709
For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...

934
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,919
...one week after humiliation in lllinois.

935
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,379
l love New York.

936
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:32,300
And l love Connecticut too.

937
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,094
How did he win here? Well, he had help.

938
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:39,891
l'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.

939
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:44,103
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

940
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:48,232
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

941
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,194
The six with the Canadians
are coming out.

942
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,831
Who signed off on this?

943
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,792
-You. Where was your passport issued?
-Vancouver.

944
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,252
-Where were you born?
-Toronto.

945
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,421
"Torono." Canadians don't pronounce the T.

946
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,007
Some Komiteh guard
is actually gonna know that?

947
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,969
lf you're detained for questioning, they will
bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

948
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:20,348
Mary, who were the last three prime ministers
of Canada?

949
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:23,309
Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

950
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,144
-What's your father's name?
-Howard.

951
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,063
- What's his occupation?
- Fisherman.

952
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,482
Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

953
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,400
What's your date of birth?

954
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,736
February 21 st, 1 952.

955
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,863
- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.

956
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,783
Associate. Last movie you produced?
- High and Dry.

957
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,451
-Who paid for that?
-CFDC.

958
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,954
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

959
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,830
-Leon?
-Shoot him. He's an American spy.

960
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,294
Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.

961
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,588
You have to know your résumé
back to front.

962
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:57,093
You really believe your little story's gonna make
a difference when there's a gun to our heads?

963
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,180
l think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

964
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,560
Okay.

965
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,734
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

966
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,373
You have a call.

967
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,343
What is it?

968
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:40,595
Go to black on green.

969
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,390
Go.

970
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,017
-lt all just changed.
-What?

971
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,769
-They're calling the game. You gotta come back.
-What?

972
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,647
Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.

973
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:54,358
Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.

974
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,402
So if the six of them...

975
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,197
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

976
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,744
Fuck. Goddamn it. l never would have exposed
them if l wasn't authorized to get them out.

977
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:07,622
-lt's over, Tony.
-lf they stay here, they will be taken.

978
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:12,543
-Probably not alive.
-Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

979
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,380
Six Americans get pulled out
of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed.. .

980
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,466
...it's a world outrage.

981
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,594
Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...

982
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,430
...with the ClA at the airport and executed?

983
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:29,477
lt's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

984
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,273
We're responsible for these people.

985
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:38,069
What we are is required to follow orders.

986
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,321
I'm sorry.

987
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,082
Fuck!

988
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,964
Come in.

989
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,176
Ready to try again.

990
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:07,181
You're ready. You worked hard.

991
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,227
Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be.. .

992
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,521
...just to relax.

993
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,398
Okay.

994
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,400
You did good.

995
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:19,610
Thanks.

996
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:35,292
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

997
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,838
Nothing gets left.

998
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,388
So you know.

999
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:52,977
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.

1000
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,150
lf we tell them now, they'll panic.
l think it's best if you just don't show.

1001
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,696
lt was always a fucked mission.

1002
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,657
You came closer than anybody else.

1003
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:22,923
lf it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break

1004
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:30,014
When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay

1005
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,977
Ahem. lt's off.
They want us to pack up the office.

1006
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,814
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

1007
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,050
He's late.

1008
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:25,522
O'Donnell.

1009
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,941
Somebody's responsible...

1010
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,943
...when things happen, Jack.

1011
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,153
l'm responsible.

1012
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,948
-l'm taking them through.
-Tony?

1013
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:48,295
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1014
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,756
-N.E. shut that down.
-l say it's back on.

1015
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,676
-l can't do it. lt's backstopped.
-Hey, wait a minute.

1016
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:56,845
What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?

1017
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,807
Carter's gotta say yes for us
to get the tickets.

1018
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,818
lt's time to go.

1019
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,204
All right.

1020
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,750
-Where's Engell?
-He's in a meeting.

1021
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:29,837
-Pull him out.
-Uh.. ..

1022
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,171
Pull him out!

1023
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,173
Thank you so much. l really appreciate it.

1024
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,426
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

1025
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,511
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

1026
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,096
Sahar will be fine.

1027
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,015
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1028
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,518
-You two leave right now, right?
-We'll be on a train in half an hour.

1029
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,769
Good.

1030
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,566
N.E. said no.

1031
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:55,404
This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!

1032
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,780
lt is going!

1033
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,949
Jack, you are this close.

1034
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,993
Am l? Am l really that close?

1035
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,120
You are this goddamn close to the line
with me.

1036
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,832
l am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1037
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,461
You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!

1038
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:20,179
Get to your plane, Claude.

1039
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:30,647
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.

1040
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,817
The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.

1041
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,988
Passports came straight from Ottawa
last week. They're clean.

1042
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,240
Find the White House chief of staff.

1043
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:41,492
How would l find him?

1044
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,661
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1045
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,749
The second checkpoint is immigration.

1046
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,667
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1047
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,420
It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.

1048
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,007
They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.

1049
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,967
You'll say you don't know what happened.

1050
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:01,053
And if you believe they lost the white slip...

1051
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,388
...they'll believe it too.

1052
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,351
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

1053
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:10,354
Where are his kids?

1054
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,563
What?

1055
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,273
Where do his kids go to school?

1056
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,782
Thank you, thank you.

1057
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,201
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1058
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,622
White House.

1059
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:33,377
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.

1060
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,879
Yeah, l'm afraid it is an emergency.

1061
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,257
Hold for the chief of staff's office.

1062
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,009
The third checkpoint is the trap.

1063
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:42,803
lt's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

1064
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:45,681
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

1065
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,101
And all of whom are looking for Americans.

1066
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:01,989
Hello?

1067
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,949
Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.
- Wait, wait, who?

1068
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,911
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

1069
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,164
They are going to be captured.

1070
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,456
David, pick up!

1071
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,643
Zurich. lt's under Harkins.

1072
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:42,487
l'm sorry, sir, l don't seem
to have these reservations.

1073
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,951
Telex on flash.

1074
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,954
Would you mind checking again, please?

1075
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,382
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

1076
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,481
My apologies. lt just came through.

1077
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:26,865
Swissair says they picked up the tickets.

1078
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,701
Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.

1079
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,995
We told them to shut that down.

1080
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,528
There you go.

1081
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,796
Not here.

1082
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,778
When did you come to Iran?

1083
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,113
Two days ago.

1084
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,948
What was the purpose of your visit?

1085
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,619
We are looking for locations for a film.

1086
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:43,502
We have a--

1087
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:48,548
Oh, yeah. l've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

1088
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,718
lf you want to take a look at that. All right?

1089
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,949
Ahem.
- You can go.

1090
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,168
Come on, come on.

1091
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:42,144
Swissair Flight 363
is now boarding Rows 1 8 to 35.

1092
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:18,805
We're going to. ...

1093
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,046
We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.

1094
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:54,633
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1095
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,301
They should have boarded already.

1096
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,053
Still no answer in L.A.

1097
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,287
Sir.

1098
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:37,801
Yes, it's a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

1099
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,678
Here you can see our notices.

1100
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,850
Of course l speak Farsi.

1101
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:48,228
l wish to make a film in Iran.

1102
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,456
No, l'm the writer.

1103
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,542
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1104
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:15,171
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

1105
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:18,008
Alien villains have taken over the hero's planet.

1106
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:21,344
They fight for their families and
take back the city.

1107
01:33:21,512 --> 01:33:27,851
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

1108
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,022
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1109
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:39,195
The people...hold that... the people are inspired tojoin him.
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

1110
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,743
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1111
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:52,208
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

1112
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:03,511
You don't go until we verify.

1113
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,101
l understand.

1114
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:12,437
Sir, you can call our office.

1115
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,938
They'll verify.

1116
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:42,050
- lt'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

1117
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,096
-We're just going to the Producers Building.
-Yeah, l understand. We're shooting right now.

1118
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:23,842
Swissair announces
final boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.

1119
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,560
Reset! We're back to one.

1120
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,687
- All right, reset.
- We're going again!

1121
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,857
-We're just right at the Producers--
-Right away, everyone! And rolling!

1122
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:41,317
-We're going to the Producers Building.
-We're rolling.

1123
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:20,607
Sorry, pal. We're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agent.

1124
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:22,108
Sir!

1125
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,039
Studio Six Productions.

1126
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,375
May l speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1127
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:43,713
l'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May l take a message?

1128
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:04,776
Doors are closing for Flight 363 to Zurich.

1129
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:14,244
We can go.

1130
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,630
You keep these. lt's a gift.

1131
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,284
Miss.

1132
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:00,910
Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?

1133
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,583
Swissair 363,
you are number two for departure.

1134
01:40:14,925 --> 01:40:18,761
Ladies and gentlemen, from
the flight deck, we are number two for takeoff.

1135
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:58,885
Swissair 363, you are cleared for takeoff.

1136
01:41:02,973 --> 01:41:04,849
Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.

1137
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:11,207
We got wheels up.

1138
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:12,792
Wait.

1139
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce...

1140
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:34,939
...that alcoholic beverages are now available
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1141
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,445
I love you.

1142
01:43:23,488 --> 01:43:25,781
They're clear. Ha-ha-ha!

1143
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:27,450
Yes! Yes!

1144
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,453
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1145
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,787
Yeah, man.

1146
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:33,956
They're out!

1147
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:37,335
-They're out! They're out!
-We got them out!

1148
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:41,797
They're out!

1149
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,803
Yes!

1150
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:50,139
Great work, boys.

1151
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,307
We did it!

1152
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,489
You are admitted to the Republic of lraq.

1153
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,868
We made history tonight.

1154
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:57,373
History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.

1155
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,542
Quote's the other way around.

1156
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:02,712
-Yeah, who said it?
-Marx.

1157
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,672
Groucho said that?

1158
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:11,721
Call the Times, nail it to the goddamn door.

1159
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:13,597
ClA are the good guys.

1160
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,599
The Canadians are the good guys.

1161
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,476
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1162
01:45:18,228 --> 01:45:22,732
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

1163
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,401
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1164
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,154
No ClA.

1165
01:45:28,363 --> 01:45:29,905
ls that right, Jack?

1166
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:33,784
lnvolved in what?

1167
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:37,288
We were as surprised as anybody.

1168
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,959
Thank you, Canada.

1169
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,837
We knew that each day they stayed there...

1170
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,673
...the danger was becoming greater.

1171
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:51,927
We had been looking for a solution to have them
leave the country during the past three months.

1172
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:54,764
Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.

1173
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:58,726
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford. ..

1174
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:01,645
...Kathy Stafford.. .

1175
01:46:02,939 --> 01:46:04,648
...Mark Lijek.. ..

1176
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:10,488
We Americans will be forever grateful
to our great friend and ally to the north...

1177
01:46:10,655 --> 01:46:14,909
...for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.

1178
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:16,327
Bob Anders.

1179
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:19,205
Here, or anywhere in the world...

1180
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,956
...Canada will pay...

1181
01:46:22,292 --> 01:46:26,295
...for this violation
of the sovereignty of Iran.

1182
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:30,674
Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

1183
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,223
So l'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
l'm having breakfast.

1184
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,476
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1185
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,021
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1186
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,649
And l said to her-- Do you know what l said?

1187
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,192
No, what?

1188
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:50,194
"Argo fuck yourself."

1189
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,015
All set.

1190
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:22,351
Thanks a lot.

1191
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:34,488
Ha!

1192
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:39,368
Heh. And l left my autograph book at home.

1193
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,709
His Eminence called me.

1194
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,085
He wants to see you.

1195
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,296
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1196
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,757
He wants to give you the lntelligence Star.

1197
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:56,802
You're getting the highest award of merit. ..

1198
01:47:57,012 --> 01:48:00,347
...of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

1199
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,225
Ceremony's on the 1 4th.

1200
01:48:03,393 --> 01:48:06,562
lf they push it a week, l can bring lan.
That's his winter break.

1201
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:12,401
The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.

1202
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,613
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

1203
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,242
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

1204
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:21,869
That's right.

1205
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:26,081
lf we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.

1206
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:29,919
-l thought we did.
-Ha.

1207
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:33,380
Carter said you were a great American.

1208
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,758
Great American what?

1209
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,760
He didn't say.

1210
01:48:51,107 --> 01:48:52,358
What happened to your picture?

1211
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:55,194
lt's in turnaround.

1212
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:39,071
Can l come in?

1213
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:35,878
The Iran Hostage Crisis ended on
January 20, 1981, when all remaining
hostages were released.
They spent 444 days in captivity.

1214
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:47,556
The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented efforts of the
Canadian embassy in freeing the six held in Tehran.
To this day, this story stands as an enduring
model for international cooperation between
governments.

1215
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:55,397
All of the Houseguests returned
to the U.S. Foreign Service after
their ordeal in Iran.

1216
01:50:56,941 --> 01:51:06,909
Oscar-winning makeup artist
John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s
Intelligence Medal, its highest civilian honor.
He and Mendez remained friends
until Chambers' death in 2001.

1217
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:15,668
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star was returned
to him in 1997, when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

1218
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:33,686
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

1219
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:31,136
They went in, as you know, under
the guise of creating a motion-picture film.

1220
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:35,974
But that it had a very high possibility
of failure.

1221
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:38,435
And after it was successful, of course...

1222
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:41,396
...it was a great temptation
