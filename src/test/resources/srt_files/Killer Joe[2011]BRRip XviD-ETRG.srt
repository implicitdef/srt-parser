1
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,166
Dottie!

2
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,000
Dottie, God damn it, wake up!

3
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,966
Shut up, T-Bone!

4
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,369
God damn it, Dottie, let me in!
T-Bone, shut up!

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,809
Dottie!

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,644
Wake Up!

7
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,006
Dottie!

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,966
Open the goddamn door!
Dottie!

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,883
Get out of that fucking bed
right fucking now!

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,647
Dottie, open this door!

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,484
Dottie!

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,127
Dottie, please open the door!
...Dottie!

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,722
Dottie, I gotta take a piss!

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,084
Wake up, it's me!

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,800
Shit!

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,961
Hold on!

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,004
- Open the goddamn door!
- I'm coming, just a second.

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,206
Shut up!

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,641
Oh, God, put some clothes on,
for Christ's sake!

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,251
Well, hell,
I didn't know who you were.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,891
Shit.

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,329
Close the goddamn door!

23
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,846
You answer the door like that,
if you don't know who the hell it is?

24
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,331
Nothing you never seen before.

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,880
Nothing half of Dallas County
hasn't seen before.

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,961
Shut up.

27
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,804
Dad here?

28
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,530
He's asleep.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,364
Dottie's here, ain't she?

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,002
- Did Adele throw you out?
- No, I need to talk to Dad.

31
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,884
Why'd she throw you out?
Did you hit her again?

32
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,564
No, I didn't hit her.

33
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,051
Hey' look,

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,202
would you please put some clothes on?

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,011
- My God, I never heard so much...
- It's a bit distracting.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,003
Your bush staring me in the face.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,445
All right! Jesus.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,045
God damn it!

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,044
Help yourself.

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,248
What'd you do?
Chop up some clover?

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,651
Where'd you get this shit?

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,563
I bought it from you.

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,930
This is that?

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,921
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,525
Adele threw him out.

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,887
So what? The boy can talk.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,485
I need a place to stay' all right?

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,927
Why'd she throw you out?

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,211
It's a long story.

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,323
Sharla, get me a beer.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,368
What'd you do? Hit her again?

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,721
No, God damn it! I didn't hit her.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,201
It's not like
you never hit her before.

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,203
This ain't none
of your goddamn business, Sharla.

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,408
- Hey, I live here.
- Calm down.

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,562
Listen, Dad,
I gotta listen to your naked wife

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,483
- giving me the third degree?
- I'm not naked.

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,768
Why do you let her walk around here
like that'?

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,001
- Like what?
- It's the middle Of the night.

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,048
She answered the door
with her beaver puckered out

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,122
- like it was trying to shake my hand.
- You hush your mouth'

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,124
- She didn't know who you were.
- That ain't the point, God damn it.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,249
I don't want Dottie looking
at her own stepmother's pussy.

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,850
That's it. I'm going to bed.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,410
I've heard all the shit
I can take in one night.

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,209
Good night.

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,209
You little shit,
I'm going to fucking kill you!

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,091
- Cut it out!
- Sweet dreams!

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,127
- ...kill you!
- Damn it.

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,929
Enough on the weed!

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,166
He can stay here tonight!

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,969
Hey, I'll stay as long
as I goddamn feel like it!

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,283
If he stays here any longer, I'm
liable to hurt the little bastard!

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,522
- Don't go to bed mad.
- Good night! Fucker!

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,082
- Don't die in your sleep!
- Goddamn hick!

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,285
What the fuck?

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,011
- Now I'm in the fucking doghouse.
- Hey, put some pamts on

78
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,684
I need to talk to you
about something.

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,127
- I need pants for that?
- So we can get out of here.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,521
- I'm not going out.
- Come on, this is private stuff.

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,443
Then fucking whisper!

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,841
I need you to put some pants on.

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,967
- No.
- Come on.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,051
I need $6,000
or some guys are gonna kill me.

85
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,849
You'd better get out of town, quick.

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,645
- If you could just give me $1,000?
- I don't have it.

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,609
Hey, I could hold them off
with $1,000.

88
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,330
Chris, I do not have it.

89
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,211
I wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for Mom.

90
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,601
Then she goes and kicks me out.

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,329
You hit her, didn't you?

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,686
God damn it, no!

93
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,762
I didn't hit her, I told you.

94
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,763
Why'd she kick you out?

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,527
I threw her up against the fridge.

96
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,523
She stole two ounces of coke from me.

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,126
That's bullshit.
Adele doesn't snort cocaine.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,164
She sold it.

99
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,250
Gave it away to that goddamn Rex,
'cause the shit's gone.

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,721
She was the only other one
knew where it was. Then tonight,

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,646
she comes up to the house
with her car running like a watch.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,645
Which? The gold Cadillac?
You're shitting me.

103
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,485
- Piece of shit hadn't run in years
- What'd I tell you?

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,643
So my blow is gone
and now these guys are gonna kill me.

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,161
And my own mother for Christ's sake.

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,811
so...?

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,444
- Huh? What?
- You gonna loan me the money?

108
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,488
- No.
- Man, I'm fucked.

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,841
I hadn't had $1,000 in
my whole life.

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,445
How'd you like to?

111
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,841
- How'd you like to have $15,000?
- Jesus.

112
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,490
No, just hear me out.

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,603
Every goddamn time,
What about the farm?

114
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,125
Leave the farm out of it.

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,043
I'm talking about something
way easier than that.

116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,406
Ugh!

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,290
This ought to be good.

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,488
You ever hear of Joe Cooper?

119
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,328
- No.
- He's a cop.

120
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,243
A detective, actually.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,847
Okay.

122
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,764
He's got a little business
on the side

123
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,921
What's he do?

124
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,204
He's a killer. He kills people.

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,960
Yeah. so?

126
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,051
Mom's got
a $50,000 life insurance policy.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't look at me like that.

128
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,448
Well, who's the...
What do you call it?

129
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,761
Beneficiary.

130
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,444
- Dottie.
- Dottie?

131
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,130
- The whole thing? The whole $50,000?
- Yup.

132
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,685
She didn't
leave nothing to me?

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,287
Of course not, you dipshit,
Why would she do that?

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,805
I'm her ex-husband.

135
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,326
She hates you, Dad.
You know that.

136
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,647
How much something like that cost?

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,688
Well, I hear he charges 20.

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,842
Thousand? Jesus.

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,730
Listen, this isn't really something
we can cut corners on.

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,007
I'd say it's worth it
not to get caught.

141
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,801
I mean, Killer Joe's a professional
He'll do this right.

142
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,724
How do you know?
Who told you about this?

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,450
Never mind that.

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,087
I want to hire him on spec
Ask him to do it for free

145
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,367
and then give him
a cut of the insurance money.

146
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,966
Well, after we pay this guy

147
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,761
- and we clear $30,000
- 30 thousand.

148
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,241
- We split it four ways
- Three ways.

149
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
- How do you figure?
- You, me and Dottie.

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,006
What about Sharla?

151
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,687
What about her?

152
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,921
She gets a cut.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,604
The hell she does,
She ain't family.

154
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,728
She's been my wife
longer than Adele was.

155
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,767
It's less money.

156
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,080
It's less money for you.

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,244
And it's more money for you.

158
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,651
I'm the father here.

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,526
I found her, She's my ex-wife.

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,170
Not you, Not Dottie.

161
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,164
Okay, fine.
We'll just split it four ways.

162
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,807
I ain't agreeing
to nothing, okay?

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,926
This is murder we're talking about.

164
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,608
I'm not just gonna stand here
nodding my head.

165
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,051
Look at it this way.
Is she doing anybody any good?

166
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,246
What do you mean?

167
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,529
Is anybody gonna care
if Mom's not around any more?

168
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,364
Yeah. Rex.

169
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,245
Son of a bitch screws
anything draws breath.

170
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,449
- That doesn't mean he doesn't care.
- He'd be tickled pink.

171
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,568
You should see the way
she treats that poor bastard.

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,010
Probably about the same way
she treated me.

173
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,609
What's better for Dottie?

174
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,365
Having $10,000,
so she can go to that Amazon school

175
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,081
or having a beat-up,
old, ugly, naggy alcoholic mother

176
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,288
for another 20 years or so?

177
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,726
- I see your point.
- Exactly.

178
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,371
So long as Dottie never knows
what we're talking about.

179
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,207
We're really doing her a favour.

180
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,566
Yeah.

181
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,048
What are you doing here?

182
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,885
Got in a fight with Mom.

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,171
You build this city all by yourself?

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,246
Yeah.

185
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,086
Sure did.

186
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,450
Brick by brick.

187
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,568
I heard that at the wedding.

188
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,928
Scared the shit out of me.

189
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,527
Sleep talking gives me the creeps.

190
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,768
Yeah. Gotten worse.

191
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,969
About every night.

192
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,726
She's not seeing anybody yet?

193
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,885
Don't hold your breath.

194
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,681
Truth be told,
I think she's still a... You know.

195
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,000
What?

196
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,320
A virgin?

197
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,726
Let me just call him.

198
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,041
And at least just set up a meet
and talk to the guy.

199
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,805
We don't got to decide anything
right now.

200
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,962
- ANSEL Okay.
- Okay. good.

201
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,408
I heard y'all talking
about killing Momma.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,048
I think it's a good idea.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,001
Well, there you go.

204
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,926
This is murder we're talking about.

205
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,209
That looks hard.

206
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,486
Who are you?

207
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,442
Joe Cooper. Joe Cooper.

208
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,488
You scared me to death.

209
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,771
Excuse me.

210
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,689
And I apologise.

211
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,286
I knocked on the door,
but you had the TV on too loud

212
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,409
to hear me,
so I decided to let myself in.

213
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,446
It's okay.

214
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,604
That looks hard. From a TV like that.

215
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,490
You should have a teacher.

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,610
I'm Joe Cooper.

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,366
I'm supposed to meet Chris here
at 10:30.

218
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,249
He's not here.

219
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,526
Well, I'm a little early.

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,329
He's usually late.

221
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,171
Could I trouble you
for a cup of coffee?

222
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,326
Sure.

223
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,563
Why don't you sit down
and I'll take your jacket.

224
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,841
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

225
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,481
Can I ask your name?

226
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,884
I'm Dottie.

227
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,405
Hello, Dottie.

228
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,686
Hi.

229
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,927
What?

230
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,165
What are you?

231
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,490
I mean, what do you do?

232
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,010
I'm a detective.

233
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,885
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

234
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,405
Like Magnum P.I?

235
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,811
No.

236
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,042
He's a private detective.

237
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,091
I'm in the Dallas Police Department.

238
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,288
- He ain't real, either...
- No.

239
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,521
I'm real.

240
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,849
I read it's nothing like them shows
with car chases and all.

241
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,684
A lot of paperwork.

242
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,009
I read some policemen
go their whole lives

243
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,764
without shooting their guns.

244
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,410
Probably true.

245
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,570
- You ever drawn your gun?
- Oh, sure.

246
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,246
You ever shot anybody?

247
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,762
- Yes.
- Who?

248
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,883
Nobody you'd know.

249
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,246
Did they die?

250
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,967
Well, they have. Yes.

251
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,086
Wow.

252
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,445
What's the most exciting thing
that's ever happened?

253
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,210
Hmm.

254
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,202
I went into this house.

255
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,485
I heard an awful screaming
coming from

256
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,409
inside in the back.

257
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,609
And it was pitch dark.

258
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,087
So I followed the sound of the scream
back to a bedroom.

259
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,643
And I didn't know
what the hell to expect.

260
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,846
Yeah.

261
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,926
When I opened the door
suddenly just... Whap!

262
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,762
There's this huge, fat man

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,410
was on top of me.

264
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,447
- Screaming and kicking and clawing
- Oh, my God.

265
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,724
And the thing was,

266
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,921
there was nobody else even there.

267
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,529
And he wasn't trying to hurt me,
He wanted me to help him.

268
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,846
Why?

269
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,200
See, he got into a fight
with his girlfriend, right?

270
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,681
She'd been having an affair, so...

271
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,927
In order to teach her a lesson.

272
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,044
That's what he said.

273
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,409
"Teach her a lesson."

274
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,051
He doused his genitals
with lighter ﬂuid

275
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,282
and he set them on fire.

276
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,284
You believe that?

277
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,130
It's true.

278
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,687
That poor miserable bastard
set his own genitals on fire

279
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,525
just to teach his girlfriend
a lesson.

280
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,809
I guess he showed her.

281
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,328
I wonder if she ever got over it.

282
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,122
- Was he all right?
- No.

283
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,846
No, he was not all right.

284
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,167
He set his genitals on fire.

285
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,650
I had an aunt
who set herself on fire once.

286
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,761
Yeah?

287
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,081
Not on purpose, though.
She was wearing this long lace dress

288
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,083
and she got it caught in the furnace.

289
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,447
She died
before they could put the fire out.

290
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,965
Really?

291
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,684
They say she's the one
in the family I look the most like.

292
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,650
Her name was Vivah.
Isn't that a pretty name?

293
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,051
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,724
I don't think
she ever got married, though.

295
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,685
You gonna answer that?

296
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,044
It's for you.

297
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,491
My dad couldn't get away from work.

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,404
I was wondering if you could meet us
at Bob's Muffler.

299
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,248
There's some place private
where we can talk?

300
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,971
There's a pool hall next door,
out of business.

301
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,883
Just off Harry Hines.

302
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,208
Bring Dottie,
she'll show you the way.

303
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,042
Don't change plans on me again.

304
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,888
Listen, I'm really sorry.

305
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,449
Could you try
to make a little more noise...

306
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,923
Why don't you try kissing my ass?
Son of a bitch.

307
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,890
Are you gonna kill my momma?

308
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,565
I don't know.

309
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,127
- Why?
- I was just curious.

310
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,366
My momma tried to kill me
when I was real little.

311
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,646
She put a pillow over my face,

312
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,371
because she cared more about herself
than her little baby.

313
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,683
She didn't love me like a momma
should love a little baby.

314
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,081
And she was happy, because
she thought she'd done it.

315
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,447
And then I couldn't grow into
something better than she'd been.

316
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,010
Had ever been.

317
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,441
She hadn't done it.
She didn't send me back to Him.

318
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,762
She just made me sick.
Made me not be for a while.

319
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,410
But then I was.

320
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,602
She was sad that I was,
and I always will be.

321
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,524
How do you know that?

322
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,491
Know what?

323
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,408
That your mother tried to kill you?

324
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,609
Because I remember.

325
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,528
This is my father, Ansel.

326
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,361
Ansel.

327
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,485
Like a beer?

328
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,770
No. No, thank you. Look.

329
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,808
I don't have a lot of time, so...

330
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,360
Alright
Let's get right To it.

331
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,643
If that's all right.

332
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,562
All right.
Well, first Off,

333
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,490
me and my father
never done nothing like this before.

334
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,047
We don't want to do it,
but it's got to be done.

335
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,131
That's got nothing to do with me.

336
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,326
All right.

337
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,249
Well, sir

338
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,170
instead of me kicking this off,
maybe you could tell us the questions

339
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,931
- we need to ask?
- It's pretty simple.

340
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,002
You're gonna pay me for a service
that I'm going to perform.

341
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,326
Uh-huh.

342
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,165
You're going to give me
the particulars of her schedule.

343
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,244
Her habits.
I'll act on them accordingly.

344
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,011
I won't give you many details
on my activities,

345
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,162
because the less you know,

346
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,401
the better for everyone involved.

347
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,365
All right.

348
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,330
Now I only have a couple of rules
that I insist on sticking to.

349
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,004
- Insist.
- Okay. Yeah.

350
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,323
If you're caught,
if you're implicated in this crime,

351
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,290
you are not under any
circumstances to reveal

352
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,528
my identity or participation.

353
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,090
Oh, of course.

354
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,289
If you break this rule,

355
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,840
you'll be killed.

356
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,681
Do you understand?

357
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,366
- I...
- I must be absolutely clear

358
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,487
on this point.

359
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,770
I understand.

360
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,330
Do you understand?

361
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,406
Yeah.

362
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,762
My payment is $25,000 in cash
in advance.

363
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,887
No exceptions.

364
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,643
- 25?
- Yes, sir.

365
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,807
- I thought you said 20.
- I was told 20.

366
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,041
25.

367
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,246
Is that a problem?

368
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,847
We don't have a problem with 25
That's not our problem.

369
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,848
Then what is your problem?

370
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,446
We have a problem with the advance.

371
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,800
- No exceptions.
- Sir, let me explain.

372
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,121
One of the reasons we're
interested in having this done

373
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,682
is my mother holds
a very large insurance policy.

374
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,727
They usually do.

375
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,928
Now we thought
if we can guarantee payment

376
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,082
after the policy had been covered...

377
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,084
Look, this really isn't open
for discussion.

378
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,323
- The conversation is finished.
- Please. this isn't...

379
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,406
What did you think this was huh?

380
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,164
Let's Make A Deal?

381
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,449
This is serious business
you're fucking with here, boy.

382
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,649
- I'm aware of that.
- No, I don't think you are.

383
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,002
I don't take you seriously.

384
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,169
This is gonna get done
one way or another.

385
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,320
Our conversation is finished.
I never met you.

386
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,521
You never met me.

387
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,161
Ofcourse, we never discussed
the possibility of a retainer.

388
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,404
What do you mean?

389
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,482
You know how to reach me.

390
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,528
Call me if she's interested.

391
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,083
Hey, man,
you talking about my sister?

392
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,089
Is that who she is?

393
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,171
Jesus.

394
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,762
What's he mean, "retainer"?

395
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,604
What do you think he means?
He means Dottie.

396
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,089
But retain what exactly?

397
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,131
Just how stupid are you?
Are you really that stupid?

398
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,284
- Watch your fucking mouth!
- What are we gonna do, Dad? Huh?

399
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,805
We gotta think of something.

400
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,326
- We could kill her ourselves!
- Are you gonna kill somebody?

401
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,131
You can't even tell time!

402
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,771
Well, what do you suggest,
smart-ass?

403
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,366
Well, we can forget
about the whole thing.

404
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,010
Or we can

405
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,450
give him Dottie.

406
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,846
Yeah,
it might just do her some good.

407
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,884
Don't be silly.
Nobody's ever gonna see them.

408
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,124
What are you so worried about anyway?

409
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,050
It's not like you can see your face
in any of them.

410
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,810
- Personal call?
- Uh-uh

411
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,167
Two large pepperoni pizzas, please.

412
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,047
That photo shop behind the mall.

413
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,925
You worry too much.

414
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,650
Just some pimply-faced lime girl

415
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,449
who never seen one before
in her life.

416
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,163
Nothing that big anyway.

417
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,641
What time you gonna pick me up?

418
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,202
8:30? What do you expect me to do
until then?

419
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,321
Hold on, Jenny.

420
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,051
Can I have some money
so I can fix supper?

421
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,691
Jenny, I gotta call you
after my shift.

422
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,001
I can't' I have to... Yeah.

423
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,730
Yeah, me, too.

424
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,444
What are you fixing
for supper tonight?

425
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,568
- Just some casserole.
- You gonna make a salad?

426
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,801
Mmm-mmm.

427
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,768
Why don't I give you
a few extra dollars?

428
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,808
Get yourself a new dress.

429
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,605
- We're having a guest for supper.
- Do we have to dress up?

430
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,843
I'm just saying
you'd look real pretty in a dress.

431
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,524
Was it your boyfriend on the phone?

432
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,801
What do you mean?

433
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,086
That wasn't your boyfriend?

434
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,606
- I'm married, silly.
- I won't tell Daddy.

435
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,681
I don't know
what you're talking about.

436
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,808
That was Jenny,
an old friend from high school.

437
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,564
Here you go.

438
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,642
I said no black Olives.

439
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,242
Fire up another supreme.
No black olives. I'm taking my break.

440
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,370
- Eat.
- Is he cute?

441
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,329
Stop talking like that.

442
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,368
You should have a cute boyfriend.

443
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,247
I had a boyfriend in the third grade.

444
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,163
I never told nobody.

445
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,527
His name was Marshall. He was fat.

446
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,886
He loved me.

447
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
You need to go out more often.

448
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,442
Nobody ever knew
we were going together.

449
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,002
We didn't see each other at recess,
we didn't sit together at lunch.

450
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,845
We never wrote notes and he didn't
walk me home from school.

451
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,684
When would you see him?

452
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,921
In class, at school.

453
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,081
I mean, alone.

454
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,764
We didn't see each other alone.

455
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,571
- Ever?
- That would have spoiled the secret.

456
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,081
How'd you know
you were going together,

457
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,049
if you never spent any time alone?

458
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,566
We just knew. If we talked about it,

459
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,688
it wouldn't have been what it was,
which was true

460
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,761
What was true?

461
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,925
Love. We loved each other.

462
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,725
How do you know he loved you,
if y'all never talked about it?

463
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,450
Because he loved me with pure love.

464
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,206
Well,

465
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,451
not many like that around, I guess.

466
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,806
It's Joe, isn't it?
Joe's coming over.

467
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,046
Joe who?

468
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,804
I don't remember.

469
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,565
His eyes hurt.

470
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,687
Huh?

471
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,966
What?

472
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,123
- Met him?
- Mmm-hmm.

473
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,051
What's he like?

474
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,248
He told me I should get a teacher
for my kung fu.

475
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,885
Yeah?

476
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,724
And he had me make him some coffee.

477
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,928
- What's he like?
- I don't know.

478
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,001
Hey, Ansel.

479
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,686
Now you just forget about Jenny
She's an old friend

480
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,000
and I don't need any trouble
from your daddy

481
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,161
over an old friend, you hear?

482
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,930
- You should have a cute boyfriend.
- Shh!

483
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,802
Hey, y'all talking about me?

484
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,850
- Your ears must've been burning.
- No, sir.

485
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,402
I was just telling Dottie here
how pretty she'd look in a new dress.

486
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,608
Yeah, I'll ride you
over to the Thrifty

487
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,206
and maybe we'll pick you out
something pretty, all right?

488
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,850
Is everyone getting dressed up?

489
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,400
Yeah, we're all getting dressed up.

490
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,165
Hey, can I get some money?
We're out of beer.

491
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,288
My purse is downstairs.

492
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,571
When are you gonna tell that girl
it's just gonna be her and Joe?

493
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,007
- She'll figure it out
- You gotta tell her.

494
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,281
That girl's not like other people.

495
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,124
God damn it,
she don't put two and two together

496
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,565
like you, me and Chris.

497
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,285
What are you so worried about?

498
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,761
She never been on a date before.

499
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,884
- It ain't a date.
- It's the closest thing

500
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,121
she'll ever come to one.

501
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,851
Except for some fat kid
that didn't even know it.

502
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,001
What fat kid?

503
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,241
You talk to that girl

504
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,482
else you're liable
to blow this whole thing real good.

505
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,444
- What am I supposed to say?
- Tell her the story, for God's sake.

506
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,562
Why do you have to make everything
so difficult?

507
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,768
- What story?
- The situation.

508
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,444
Tell her
why Joe is coming over tonight.

509
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,723
- How am I supposed to get to that?
- If she don't know

510
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,003
what's expected of her,
she might disappoint him.

511
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,844
I'm riding her over to
the Thrifty, ain't I?

512
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,408
Ugh!

513
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,930
What about my beer money?
...Sharla.

514
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,247
What fat kid?

515
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,931
Hope you have a spare.

516
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,240
Daddy?

517
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,486
Daddy.

518
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,683
Hey, hey, look at you.

519
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,681
You look like a
goddamn movie star.

520
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,361
Turn around.

521
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,280
Turn around.

522
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,084
Yeah, just like
a goddamn movie star.

523
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,930
I feel funny.

524
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,091
Oh, don't say that,
You look beautiful.

525
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,204
My butt's too big.

526
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,409
Well, let me let you in
on a little secret.

527
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,251
- Guys like big butts
- They do not.

528
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,849
I'm speaking from experience.

529
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,888
Sharla doesn't have a big butt.

530
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,486
Yeah, well, give her some time.

531
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,051
Why aren't you dressed yet?

532
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,891
'Cause I'm not gonna stay for supper.

533
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,244
What do you mean?

534
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,322
Chris and I got some business
to attend to

535
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,401
Where's Chris?

536
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,529
So it's just gonna be you
and Joe for supper.

537
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,008
- I should change.
- No. No.

538
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,766
- No. honey.
- Yeah, I should.

539
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,728
Dottie, I think it'd be nice for Joe,
if he saw you looking pretty.

540
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,121
- Yeah, I'm going to...
- Listen, honey. Dottie!

541
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,767
- Just settle down. Dottie!
- Let go of me, I have to change!

542
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,091
- Dottie, wait a second!
- Change! I have to change!

543
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,446
I have to change!

544
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,205
Dottie' don't close
that fucking door on me.

545
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,282
I have to change!

546
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,964
God damn it!

547
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,287
Hold still, you little bitch.

548
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,127
- What the hell's going on in here?
- What the fuck!

549
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,202
What the hell's going on?

550
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,370
- She wants to take off her dress.
- So?

551
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,044
Well, don't you think she looks nice?

552
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,043
Let her change, if she wants.
You put on whatever you like.

553
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,807
- Don't you think she looks nice?
- Hey, let her change, Dad!

554
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,086
Let her change!

555
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,322
- Hang on a goddamn second.
- Hey

556
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,165
Let her change.
...Change.

557
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,686
What are you doing here?

558
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,569
We're on our way out.

559
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,211
- We discussed this.
- Well, don't push it. We're leaving.

560
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,124
That's right, junior. Don't push it.

561
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,011
Now, we make arrangements,

562
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,448
I expect the details
to have some attention paid to them.

563
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,090
Let's go, Dad.

564
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,170
You understand?

565
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,401
Yeah.

566
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,771
Good boy.

567
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,851
Where is she?

568
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,604
She's changing.

569
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,686
Too bad he didn't
meet Sharla first.

570
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,570
He could've dated her,
I wouldn't have minded so much.

571
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,564
That's my wife you're
talking about, fuck head.

572
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,290
Yeah. Right.

573
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,286
Dottie?

574
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,564
It's me, Joe Cooper.

575
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,486
We're alone now.

576
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,321
You don't wanna come out,
it's okay.

577
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,006
You stay in there
as long as you like.

578
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,163
Casserole smells nice.

579
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,405
I wish I had a funny story
about first dates

580
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,767
or casseroles, but I don't.

581
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,882
Maybe one will come to me.

582
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,491
Maybe not.

583
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,162
Lee Hazlewood. Okie from Muskogee.

584
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,330
I don't have a funny story
about Lee Hazlewood, either.

585
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,811
Or Oklahoma.

586
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,686
I guess Oklahoma's
kind of funny anyway though.

587
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,248
I grew up, looking at Oklahoma.

588
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,081
From the south bank
of the Red River.

589
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,570
When I was a boy,
the border between Texas

590
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,042
and Oklahoma
was actually the middle of the river.

591
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,203
You fish the north bank,
you caught Okie fish.

592
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,049
I caught Texas fish.

593
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,410
Sometime since then,
we gave our half of the river away.

594
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,650
Now the whole damn thing
belongs to Oklahoma.

595
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,925
South bank.

596
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,088
That's the border now.

597
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,967
I'm not sure why we did that.

598
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,404
But it makes me mad.

599
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,722
Ifs kind of like giving away

600
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,850
your front porch.

601
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,841
- How are you?
- Fine.

602
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,605
You wanna know how I am?

603
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,445
How are you?

604
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,607
I'm fine. Thank you.

605
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,684
You look nice.

606
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,927
Thank you.

607
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,764
I changed.

608
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,242
I didn't know it was just gonna be
you and me for dinner

609
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,527
Someone should have told you.

610
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,804
They did Just now.

611
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,009
What did you change from?

612
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,360
A dress.

613
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,324
I'd love to see it.

614
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,170
Your eyes hurt.

615
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,770
I beg your pardon?

616
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,400
Dottie, do you trust me?

617
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,845
Not quite.

618
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,726
Good.

619
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,920
Lovely.

620
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,045
I'm a virgin.

621
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,041
I know.

622
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,646
Ay!

623
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,886
- Tuna casserole.
- Yes.

624
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,362
- May I serve?
- Please.

625
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,091
Thank you.

626
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,246
Mmm.

627
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,649
I'd really like to see that dress.

628
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,404
It wasn't right.

629
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,244
May I see it anyway?

630
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,364
How you gonna kill my momma?

631
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,322
That's not appropriate
dinner conversation, Dottie.

632
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,485
Unless you poison her.

633
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,930
Will you be the detective
who investigates?

634
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,331
Probably not.

635
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,765
Sometimes.

636
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,009
Is that a problem?

637
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,244
That's convenience.

638
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,804
So are homes.

639
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,486
Yes.

640
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,324
I love my brother.

641
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,922
I remember when Momma and Daddy
were getting a divorce.

642
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,441
She just told us. She was drunk.

643
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,489
She said,
"I don't love your daddy no more".

644
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,884
"I never loved him."

645
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,331
And I screamed something
that didn't make any sense.

646
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,971
Ran out of the house
to the front yard.

647
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,610
Chris came out.
He hadn't said anything.

648
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,924
He just laid on top of me.
He stretched his body out like this.

649
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,361
Laid on top of me
till I stopped crying.

650
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,521
- Dottie...

651
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,443
We never talked about it ever.

652
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,730
Bring the dress.

653
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,484
- Now?
- Yes.

654
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,689
Why wouldn't you wear that for me?

655
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,490
'Cause it's not me.

656
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,282
Not when you're not in it.

657
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,205
- I once had a boyfriend.
- Put it on.

658
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,725
Alright.

659
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,207
Where are you going?

660
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,170
- I was going to put on the dress.
- I said put it on.

661
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,921
I was.

662
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,561
Here.

663
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,608
I wanna see you put it on.

664
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,440
Stop.

665
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,684
Take off your socks.

666
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,323
Take off your brassiere.

667
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,971
Take off your underwear.

668
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,486
Babies?

669
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,964
Put on the dress.

670
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,411
Come here.

671
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,410
Right behind me.

672
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,287
Put your hand inside my pants.

673
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,890
Do you feel that?

674
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,727
Yes.

675
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,563
What's that feel like?

676
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,489
I don't remember.

677
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,004
How old are you now?

678
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,241
12.

679
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,245
So am I.

680
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,449
Switch places with me.

681
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,450
Your boyfriend?

682
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,611
- Marshall.
- Marshall.

683
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,205
He was fat.

684
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,851
Uh-huh.

685
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,322
He loved me with pure love.

686
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,844
It was our secret.

687
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,486
Nobody.

688
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,330
Oh.

689
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,645
Come on!

690
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,083
1,000 on On the Nose,
on 5 on the eighth at Lone Star.

691
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,323
ANNOUNCER
On My Mind there in sixth.

692
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,767
And it's Mango, Cliff, Rick's Café

693
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,889
and way, way back there, Bella Luna.

694
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,606
Less than half a mile to go
as they move into the far turn.

695
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,809
Betty Boo leads a nose
on the outside. Yes I Can...

696
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,882
It's still Tilt a Whirl
with a tenuous lead.

697
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,803
Legal Tender and Endearing Manners

698
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,120
strikes the front
just outside the eighth pole.

699
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,201
Come on, 5.

700
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,049
Cavalier coming down hard
the centre of the track

701
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,121
and Daddy Mike is right there.

702
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,964
- Come on, 5. Come on, 5, come on 5!
- Towards the inside,

703
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,087
- coming on through
- Piece of shit.

704
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,650
...but it's Endearing Manner
that's come on now

705
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,121
- to take the lead as they come...
- He held back!

706
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,686
- And in a spectacular finish...
- He held back!

707
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,651
A spectacular upset, Endearing
Manner has won the impossible!

708
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,724
17 to 1,
resolved at Lone Star here today.

709
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,040
God damn, motherfuck!

710
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,920
- Hey.
- Time's up brother.

711
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,085
You asked for an extra week
three weeks ago brother.

712
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,245
- You told me you had a plan
- No, listen, I called you.

713
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,288
- I called you at 11:00
- This the plan?

714
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,646
Come on, G-Man.

715
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,242
Yeah, the money is coming to you
by about, Motherfucking...

716
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,285
Son of a bitch!

717
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,444
You little motherfucker!

718
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,010
Where you going?

719
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,005
Piece of shit!

720
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,362
Here you go, here you go!

721
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,241
Chris.

722
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,926
Hi Digger.

723
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,131
How you been, boy?

724
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,130
Pretty good. How about yourself?

725
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,487
Oh, fair to middling.

726
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,925
Blood pressure.

727
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,881
You taking medicine?

728
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,042
Yeah, alt that.
No salt, low stress.

729
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,246
Course, Amy keeps making that fried
chicken. You know I can't resist it.

730
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,730
How is Amy?

731
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,929
Well, she's all busted up
right at the moment.

732
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,641
You remember Dumpling,
that old bluetick we had?

733
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,126
Yeah, sure, Dumpling.

734
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,971
Yeah, well, we had to put him
to sleep yesterday morning

735
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,764
- Oh, no.
- Yup.

736
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,126
Well, you missed yourself
a hell of a party

737
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,201
a couple of weeks ago.

738
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,486
Sorry I missed your birthday.

739
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,409
Well, I'm glad
you missed my birthday.

740
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,000
I just wish you hadn't
missed the party.

741
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,401
How many people we have
out there at the place, G-Man?

742
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,481
A couple hundred.

743
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,523
Oh, hell, it wasn't that many.

744
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,608
- 150 anyway.
- No shit.

745
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,171
Sorry l missed it.

746
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,284
Yeah, good old party.
Lots of barbeque.

747
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,841
Hey, G-Man here,
he played the accordion.

748
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,531
That's right.

749
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,841
- Hey, wasn't that gal out there?
- What gal?

750
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,446
Well, the one that's always
sniffing around Chris's shit here.

751
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,161
What the hell's her name?

752
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,163
The one with the great big caboose
on her...

753
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,884
- Arlene?
- Arlene.

754
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,644
Yeah, Arlene.

755
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,204
You'd better look out for her, boy.
She may be too much woman for you.

756
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,521
Well, she'd better stay away
from the barbeque

757
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,608
or she'd be too much woman
to fit through the door.

758
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,568
Damn, you make me laugh.

759
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,849
Hey, listen, I'm just gonna have the
boys here kick the shit out of you.

760
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,207
You'd better pay me my money
in a couple of days

761
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,526
or I'm gonna wrap you up
in electrician tape

762
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,082
and bury you in a coffin
about 10 feet deep. Huh?

763
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,321
I'll tell Amy you asked about her.

764
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,731
That'll make her smile.

765
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,207
He really likes you.

766
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,483
- Stay the hell down!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

767
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,289
- Easy, Easy.
- Oh, my God, what happened?

768
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,002
- Fuck!
- Chris! Shit. You look rough, boy.

769
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,241
Them old boys caught up to you huh.

770
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,483
Dad! I think they broke my hand!

771
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,925
- What did they do to your face?
- Excuse me.

772
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,764
- You want to go to the hospital?
- I think he does.

773
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,049
- I got beat up.
- What happened to you? - I got beat up!

774
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,207
Can we get a wet rag?

775
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,890
They put the fucking boot to you,
or what?

776
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,561
That son of a bitch Digger Soames?

777
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,648
They do all they were going to?

778
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,404
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead.

779
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,289
- Your nose is broken.
- Is that all?

780
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,891
What'd they say to you?

781
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,123
What the fuck do you think they said?

782
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,601
- I reckon they want their money.
- No shit!

783
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,681
Hey, you want a beer?

784
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,171
Where'd they find you?

785
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,129
Fucking Sport of Kings.

786
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,281
Did you see Bill there?

787
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,489
I don't know, why?

788
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,891
He owes me 10 bucks.

789
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,446
I'm going to bed. Come on Ansel.

790
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,561
We have to go to the hospital.

791
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,688
No' he's fine.
He just got a whupping.

792
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,649
- Ansel! Come on!
- All right, then.

793
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,848
I guess we're gonna turn in.

794
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,409
Dottie, go on.

795
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,849
Good night Chris.

796
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,328
I want to know what kind
of progress you're making.

797
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,124
It's being taken care of.

798
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,247
Yeah, right.

799
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,521
You've been fucking my sister

800
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,881
and my mother's a hell of a lot
healthier than me at the moment.

801
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,644
Do you want me off the job?
Say the word.

802
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,490
When are you planning on doing it?

803
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,440
Tonight.

804
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,366
Really?

805
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,168
So you'd be leaving tomorrow then?

806
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,403
No, no, no,
the retainer's for the money.

807
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,726
I'm not leaving until I get my money.

808
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,081
I don't like that.

809
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,207
Well, I don't care.

810
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,328
I don't want you near my sister.

811
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,249
I don't care.

812
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,001
And if I tell you the deal's off?

813
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,167
Then I'll leave right now
and you'll never see me again.

814
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,971
Your call.

815
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,202
Who you into for this money?

816
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,530
I won't tell you.

817
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,165
Digger Soames?

818
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,850
How'd you know that?

819
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,922
What did he say he'd do to you,
if you don't pay him?

820
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,331
You know that too?

821
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,085
He'll do it.

822
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,290
Aren't you supposed to arrest people
who commit murder?

823
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,730
I like Digger.

824
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,561
Do it.

825
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,366
- Mr Tim.
- Hey Joe.

826
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,291
Joe, Joe. Thank God.

827
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,846
I was afraid I wouldn't get here.
I'd be too late, Thank God.

828
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,571
Listen, we got to stop this.
Alright?

829
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,165
I've been in a lot of trouble
all my life,

830
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,089
but I never did nothing
like this before.

831
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,004
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to waste your time.

832
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,890
I mean, I hate that bitch.
I always hated her.

833
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,401
I just can't be the one, you know?

834
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,847
But the main thing really is Dottie.

835
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,083
You know, my sister
never did nothing to nobody.

836
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,571
- (CAR LOCK BEEPS}
- You got to give her up,

837
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,130
'cause I can't look her in the eyes otherwise.

838
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,931
I mean, you can't have her.
I can't let you have her.

839
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,765
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

840
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,286
Hop in.

841
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,409
Shit. OW!

842
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,201
Fuck!

843
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,684
I started a farm once.
It seemed like the life I wanted.

844
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,282
Work for myself outside a lot.
Live in the country, smoke dope.

845
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,285
Watch TV. That's all I really want.
So I started a rabbit farm.

846
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,771
I built it with my own two hands.

847
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,322
Lumber, chicken wire,
water bottles, pellets, rabbits.

848
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,970
I loved those little bastards.

849
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,769
They smell like shit
and they fuck all the time,

850
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,604
but they're awful easy going animals.

851
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,524
A rat, a skunk or something
got into the pen

852
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,364
and it was rabid
and awful hot out too.

853
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,204
And they just tore each other up.

854
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,443
Their eyes rolling and foaming
at the mouth and screaming.

855
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,922
You know rabbits scream?
They sound just like little girls.

856
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,122
I mean, it was disturbing.

857
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,962
I started selling dope for a living.
I knew more about it, so...

858
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,611
So I can't pay this guy
and I don't even really want to.

859
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,970
You gotta get out Joe.

860
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,725
You gotta leave my sister
alone forever.

861
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,090
What's going on?

862
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,761
Jesus.

863
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,846
Easy.

864
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,690
- Put her feet on the floorboard.
- Alright.

865
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,724
- Alright?
- Yeah.

866
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,721
Put that in the trunk and shut it.

867
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,889
Give me some light.

868
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,488
- I was watching that, Chris.
- Listen.

869
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,091
- I was watching a show.
- I know.

870
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,686
- I wanted to see how it turned out!
- He don't catch the bird, okay?

871
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,207
- It just goes on and on and on.
- Yeah?

872
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,165
Listen, honey.

873
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,446
I know, you know what's going on,
okay?

874
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,447
I don't got to explain it to you.

875
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,681
Mmm-hmm.

876
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,691
If I'd known
how this would all fall out

877
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,051
I might have done things different.

878
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,121
No.

879
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,810
What's wrong?

880
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,325
For God's sake.

881
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,286
Shit.

882
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,601
- Good Morning y'all.
- Good morning.

883
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,000
Morning.

884
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,124
What was her maiden name, Ansel?

885
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,203
I need it for the file.

886
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,088
Yes, sir. Rogers.

887
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,367
Adele Carolyn Rogers.

888
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,450
- Is there gonna be a trial?
- No. No.

889
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,643
- Joe knows what he's doing.
- I ain't never been to a trial.

890
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,842
Did you see the shot in the paper?
Her car?

891
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,287
Joe knows what he's doing' all right?
They couldn't do no autopsy,

892
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,204
'cause there wasn't much
left to speak of.

893
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,008
- How'd it go?
- Let's just get out of here.

894
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,483
- Little son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

895
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,202
I am not talking in front of Dottie.

896
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,890
She knows what's going on.

897
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,401
- I'm not talking in front of her.
- What happened with Filpatrick?

898
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,764
I ain't talking in front of Dottie!

899
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,764
They're not gonna pay you
the money, are they?

900
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,968
- Dad?
- Ansel, calm down.

901
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,170
- Dad?
- Ansel! Don't make a scene!

902
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,562
Who told you about Adele's policy?

903
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,881
Rex! Rex told me.

904
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,850
He just mentioned it in conversation.
Will you, for the love of God...

905
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,001
When?

906
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,447
- In conversation.
- Not how, when?

907
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,725
A few weeks ago.
Me and Mom just had a big fight...

908
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,564
- Oh, Christ.
- I told you, Ansel.

909
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,091
- What happened?
- I told you from the start.

910
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,162
- Shut up!
- Don't tell me to shut up!

911
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,083
- I'm not the one who blew this thing.
- What happened, Dad?

912
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,242
You show up at our place,
tell everyone what to do.

913
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,249
How we're all gonna see
a hundred grand!

914
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,481
God damn it, you tell me right now.

915
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,450
Dottie is not the beneficiary!

916
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,771
- Rex is the beneficiary!
- I don't understand.

917
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,651
- It's not real tough.
- Explain it to me.

918
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,161
Dottie does not get the money.

919
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,569
- Rex gets the money.
- Wait.

920
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:29,283
Dottie does not get $50,000 boy!

921
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,967
Rex! Rex!

922
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,371
Rex gets the $50,000.

923
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,404
- That's not right.
- That's the way it is! That can't be.

924
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,570
- Go talk to Filpatrick yourself!
- I was told!

925
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,880
Because he told me!

926
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,962
Rex told me, he told me!

927
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,248
Rex was Momma's boyfriend.

928
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,926
Just shut up Dottie, He told me!

929
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,241
- He was lying. - Why would he do that?
- Why do you think?

930
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,324
No. No, he couldn't have
known I'd do this.

931
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,367
Who told you about Killer Joe?

932
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,846
Oh.

933
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,486
Oh, God.

934
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,328
I told you. - Yeah.
Did I tell you?

935
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,006
Oh my God, I'm fucked.

936
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,090
Piece of fucking fuck-suck-cake!

937
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,729
I don't believe you God.

938
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,370
You'd better believe it!

939
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,528
'Cause the sooner you believe it,
the sooner you figure out a way

940
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,284
to pay Killer Joe his money!

941
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,688
- We gotta get going.
- Not to mention Digger Soames.

942
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,728
- Gotta get going y'all.
- For what?

943
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,080
Funeral's in a half hour.

944
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,969
Y'all get going.
I gotta think of something.

945
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,491
I wish you would.

946
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,325
We're all so much better off
whenever you do.

947
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,927
Where's Joe?
He's coming back, isn't he?

948
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,206
Yeah.

949
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,807
- He's coming back all right.
- Yeah, he's coming back all right.

950
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,804
Let's hit it. We gotta get
your mother tn the ground

951
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,122
- I'll take Dottie.
- Dottie!

952
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,169
Yeah, we'll be along.

953
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,481
Ms Smith, when you're done
fumigating the gates of hell.

954
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,849
Hey, Chris.

955
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,488
Why don't you do us
all a big favour?

956
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,449
Just go kill yourself.

957
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,685
Do you feel bad?

958
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,241
Yeah.

959
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,966
I feel like maybe I'm not supposed
to be on Earth or something.

960
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,967
Do you remember them shows
you used to put on with your knees?

961
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,411
Huh?

962
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,605
We'd be laying in bed and you'd get
a flashlight and put your knees up

963
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,489
and put a pair of sunglasses
on one knee

964
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,006
and some kind of hat on the other?

965
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,086
Yeah.

966
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,683
Put on a little show.

967
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,084
"Greatest Show on Earth“
is what you called it.

968
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,281
Yeah?

969
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,686
Into time and forever, from now on,
no more adventures,

970
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,842
time outs or king's exes.

971
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,926
Everlasting one more time
than you can say,

972
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,288
into infinity and outer space, Amen.

973
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,208
Nothing's worse than regret.

974
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,127
Not cancer,
not being eaten by a shark, nothing.

975
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,448
Joe's coming back isn't he?
'Cause I...

976
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,931
I'm leaving.

977
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,331
- I think maybe...
- I want you to come with me.

978
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,686
Where?

979
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,006
Mexico.

980
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,649
No, further. Peru.

981
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,850
In South America.

982
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,806
- How we gonna get there?
- We'll drive.

983
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,846
We can drive it.

984
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,400
- Chris...
- Do you like Texas?

985
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,810
These people talk about it like
it's such a great place and all,

986
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,247
but it's really just a bunch of
goddamn hicks and rednecks,

987
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,971
with too much space
to walk around in!

988
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,682
- It's warm.
- Let's go.

989
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,531
Let's just go.

990
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,441
- Now.
- To the funeral?

991
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,650
Hey, if we're gonna pull this off
we gotta gas up.

992
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,290
- I have to see Joe.
- No, Dottie.

993
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,407
I have to see him.

994
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,925
We have to go to Peru now!

995
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,561
Well, then you go by yourself.
'Cause I have to see Joe!

996
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,649
I'll make you a deal.

997
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,730
We'll go to the funeral
and you can see Joe after.

998
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,206
No funny stuff, Promise.

999
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,691
You swear?

1000
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,481
I swear.

1001
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,445
You can't tell Joe
we're going to Peru, okay?

1002
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,648
You can't tell him goodbye,
not outright.

1003
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,565
- Okie-dokie.

1004
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,768
And you can't tell
Dad or Sharla, either,

1005
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,321
'cause they're mad at me right now
and might try to spoil our trip.

1006
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,530
- I understand.

1007
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,926
You excited?
You wanna go?

1008
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,684
I'm always excited.

1009
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,122
We can do this. We can pull this off.

1010
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,442
Not if somebody makes me mad.

1011
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:44,045
Rex didn't even bother to show up.
Son of a bitch.

1012
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,331
Bow down thy ear to me.
Deliver me speedily.

1013
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,007
Be thou my strong rock
for a house of defence to save me.

1014
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,611
I would be glad to
rejoice in thy mercy.

1015
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,969
For thou has considered my trouble.

1016
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,965
Thou has known
my soul in adversities.

1017
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,087
And thou has not shut me up
into the hand of the enemy.

1018
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,891
Thou has set my feet
in the Lord's room.

1019
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,842
Have mercy on me, oh, Lord.

1020
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,808
I am forgotten
as a dead man out of mind.

1021
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,644
We are gathered here
to put to eternal rest

1022
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,409
Adele Carolyn Rogers-Smith.

1023
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,206
Beloved mother of two children,
Christopher and Dorothy.

1024
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,208
Devoted to her family and community.

1025
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,366
Hey Rex.

1026
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,210
Hands on the car.

1027
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,562
- Fucking asshole.
- Whatever.

1028
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,241
Dottie!

1029
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,081
It's us!

1030
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,931
We stopped by the K-Fry-C.
You hungry?

1031
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,840
Dottie!

1032
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,447
Chris!

1033
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,364
- Hey. Fetch me a beer, would you?
- He's not here.

1034
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,570
- Hey Joe.
- Dottie here?

1035
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,450
She's asleep.

1036
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,202
- Where's Chris?
- I don't know.

1037
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,328
Do you want some chicken?
We stopped by the K-Fry-C.

1038
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,004
Yes, please.

1039
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,924
Sure, help yourself.
It's right here on the stove.

1040
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,604
Fetch it for him, would you, hon?

1041
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,444
Sure, white or dark?

1042
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,527
Leg.

1043
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,570
You want a beer?

1044
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,005
Yes, please.

1045
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,803
Set that on the table, please?

1046
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,884
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1047
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,245
Funerals make people hungry
for some reason.

1048
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,441
Huh.

1049
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,010
I'm starving.

1050
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,080
Mmm.

1051
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,288
- You hear about the insurance?
- Sharla.

1052
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,170
- Yes, I did.
- I don't know what to say.

1053
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,242
You don't have to say anything.
It's not your fault.

1054
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,482
- Yeah, but
- Chris.

1055
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,689
That Chris is so stupid, I could
have told you he'd fuck this up.

1056
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,762
- Why didn't you?
- Why didn't I?

1057
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,207
It's just an expression, really.

1058
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,847
What is?

1059
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,760
What she said. That she could
have told you Chris would fuck it up.

1060
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,763
I've never heard of that expression.

1061
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,128
- A manner of speaking, really.
- I never liked that little bastard.

1062
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,326
- You haven't?
- Mmm-mmm.

1063
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,085
He's just no good.
You can't trust him.

1064
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,640
- You never really hit it off.
- All he cares about is himself.

1065
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,924
- That's not fair.
- Bullshit fair, it's true.

1066
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,844
It's really all anybody cares about
if you think about it.

1067
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,050
- No wonder.
- No wonder what?

1068
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,687
No wonder Chris wound up
the way he did.

1069
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,971
- What the fuck did I do?
- Just shut up.

1070
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,051
I mean, how stupid do you have to be

1071
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,521
to let an idiot like Rex
take advantage?

1072
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,409
- Rex?
- Yeah, Rex.

1073
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,841
- What about Rex?
- I said...

1074
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,651
I said, how stupid do you have to be
to let an idiot like Rex

1075
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,643
- take advantage?
- Yes, I heard what you said.

1076
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,724
- Tell me about Rex.
- Rex is Adele's boyfriend.

1077
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,006
Was.

1078
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,529
Was Adele's boyfriend.

1079
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,885
Tell me about Rex.

1080
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,327
- What do you want to know?
- Not you.

1081
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,084
- You.
- What?

1082
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,845
You. Tell me about Rex.

1083
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,326
What do you mean?

1084
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,687
Now, you know the man, don't you?
I mean, you have met.

1085
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,161
- Yeah, ofcourse.
- Tell me about him.

1086
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,366
I don't know what you mean.

1087
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,962
Is he tall? is he fat? is he Chinese?

1088
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,850
Where does he work, how old is he,
do his ears hang low?

1089
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,447
Is he unlike other men?
Tell me about Rex.

1090
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,168
Rex is..

1091
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,691
I don't get this, really.

1092
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,523
Who told you
about our arrangement?

1093
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,726
What arrangement?

1094
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,565
The contract between
myself and this family?

1095
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,091
- Ansel.
- Why?

1096
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,049
Well, she is my wife. Joe.

1097
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,885
- I wasn't addressing you, sir.
- Okay.

1098
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,083
- Why did he tell you?
- I'm his wife, like he said.

1099
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,324
Were you gonna get
a cut of this money?

1100
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,971
- Sure.
- Why?

1101
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,206
'Cause I'm his wife, like he said.

1102
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,326
Did you advise Ansel
against the idea?

1103
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,366
No.

1104
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,487
Why?

1105
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,770
You could have told him
Chris would fuck it up.

1106
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,407
It's none of my business.

1107
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,323
But it is, isn't it?

1108
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,449
I mean, it is your business.

1109
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,730
What are you getting at?

1110
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,086
If you were going to
share in the money,

1111
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,686
then it is your business, isn't it?

1112
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,481
Yeah, I don't know.

1113
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,531
Yet you did not advise Ansel,
your husband, against it?

1114
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,967
Look, I wanted some of
that money alright.

1115
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,611
If... If, Chris could
pull this off, then I...

1116
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,444
Were you gonna split Ansel's share?

1117
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,524
or were the four of you
gonna split it evenly?

1118
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,204
- We didn't discuss that.
- I'm sure you did.

1119
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,682
You're a practical woman.

1120
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,326
Well, I assumed
that I would take a fourth.

1121
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,488
Not one-half of one-third?

1122
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,769
- No, a fourth, four ways.
- Instead of one-sixth.

1123
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,571
One-sixth.

1124
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,884
No. Four ways.

1125
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,962
So the remainder of the money

1126
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,203
would be split evenly
after I'd been paid my fee.

1127
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,808
- $25,000.
- Right, right. Right.

1128
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,805
- Yeah, right after you were covered.
- Which means equal shares.

1129
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,563
What would those four equal
shares come out to?

1130
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,241
- I haven't done the math.
- Well then do it with me. Right now.

1131
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,121
The insurance policy gets covered.

1132
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,851
The agent Filpatrick
cuts Ansel a cheque.

1133
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,651
Dottie, That would be Dottie.

1134
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,366
Right, best of all
possible worlds, Dottie.

1135
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,885
Look, I don't know
why we're doing all this.

1136
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,371
We're not gonna see
any of that money.

1137
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,885
Just watch my feet here, alright?

1138
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,200
Alright. Mhmm.

1139
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,806
- So Ansel gets the cheque.
- Dottie.

1140
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,247
- Dottie.
- Look, if the cheque is for 100,

1141
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,049
We Pay you 25.

1142
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,645
- How much?
- 25.

1143
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,204
How much, though, the policy is for?

1144
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,681
However much. How much?

1145
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,882
- 50 thousand.
- That much.

1146
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,646
- 50 minus your 25.
- Right, minus my 25,

1147
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,285
but you said 100, didn't you?

1148
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,885
Yeah, however much,
minus your money.

1149
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,007
No, but you said 100.

1150
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,525
- Yeah, however much.
- The cheque is for 100.

1151
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,847
- However much.
- But you said 100.

1152
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,844
However much,
minus your 25.

1153
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,771
She was mistaken, Joe.
It's 50.

1154
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,725
Alright?

1155
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,286
Is it?

1156
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,806
Yeah.

1157
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,088
Stick around for witches
as Christopher Lee

1158
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,164
unearths a whole coven
at the Horror Hotel.

1159
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,608
Join us for more of our George Raft
marathon. Starting with Whistle Stop.

1160
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,168
Fuck! Come on!

1161
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,361
Isn't it?

1162
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,567
No.

1163
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,650
Wait a minute!

1164
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,803
In case of accidental death,
the figures double.

1165
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,410
Right, Filpatrick told us that
this morning, didn't he Ansel?

1166
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,807
- Nah ah.
- Yeah, I think he did.

1167
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,201
Ansel?

1168
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,441
Did he?

1169
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,001
- No.
- I think he did.

1170
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,081
So...

1171
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,884
- It's not 50?
- No.

1172
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,331
It's 100.

1173
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,763
- Like I say, however much.
- However much.

1174
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,242
- Look, what are you getting at?
- What do you mean?

1175
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,131
- I made a mistake alright?
- Yes, you did.

1176
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,409
- I said 50 or 100. However much.
- Mmm-hmm.

1177
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,324
Y'all gonna do this now?

1178
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,880
You said that you
never cared for Chris.

1179
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,371
I haven't, I don't.

1180
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,564
And you also said
that Rex is an idiot.

1181
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,971
Yeah, right.

1182
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,050
And you also said that the cheque
was for 100.

1183
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,490
Or however much!

1184
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,770
- I was just wondering.
- What are you getting at?

1185
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,570
Oh fuck.

1186
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,085
Whose dick is that?

1187
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,246
Where did you get those?

1188
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,090
That's not Ansel's dick.

1189
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,964
Is that your dick, Ansel?

1190
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,241
No.

1191
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,088
Yes, it is, darling. You were drunk.

1192
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,604
How about that one?

1193
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,366
Nope.

1194
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,440
That one?

1195
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,651
Make sure now,
you might have been drunk.

1196
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,691
- No.
- Hmm.

1197
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,007
Whose dick is it?

1198
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,570
You just stop that.

1199
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,964
- That must be your boyfriend.
- Oh, please.

1200
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,527
- Your boyfriend Rex.
- Oh, please now.

1201
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,803
That idiot.
The one who's getting all that money.

1202
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,809
- I didn't know!
- All 100 grand.

1203
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,003
Just stop it! I didn't know
anything about this, I swear.

1204
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,770
Were you aware of this, Ansel?

1205
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,491
- I'm never aware.
- Of course not.

1206
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,251
Whose is it?

1207
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,123
You son of a bitch!

1208
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,642
There's no need for name calling.
I haven't called you any names.

1209
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,326
I am a guest here, You be polite.

1210
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,081
Now.

1211
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,729
Whose little dick is that,
and do not lie to me.

1212
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,724
You lie to me, and it will be
the last lie you ever tell.

1213
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,522
- Rex. - Rex?
- It's Rex - Who?

1214
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,090
- Rex!
- Correct.

1215
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,170
Ansel, please!

1216
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,289
Ansel is not too inclined
to assist you at this point in time.

1217
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,925
Are you Ansel?

1218
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,685
No, I'm not.

1219
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,764
In fact, Ansel's doing just fine
standing over there.

1220
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,760
Yes sir.

1221
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,769
That's what I thought.

1222
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,487
- Let me go, you motherfucker!
- What did I say about insulting me?

1223
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,366
We'll give you the money,
I swear it.

1224
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,369
We'll give you as much money
as you want!

1225
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,522
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1226
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,640
No. ifs not.

1227
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,644
Rex picked up the settlement
this afternoon.

1228
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,961
What?

1229
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,566
He gave it to me before he left.

1230
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,250
100 grand.

1231
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,524
God Almighty.

1232
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,806
Where did he go?

1233
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,402
Worthless, of course.
It's made out to Rex.

1234
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,767
Where did he
say he was going?

1235
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,248
- He was unavailable for comment.
- I don't understand.

1236
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,250
Why didn't you get him to...

1237
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,691
I can...

1238
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,921
I can get him.

1239
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,208
Looks like you need a new boyfriend.

1240
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,250
I'll be your boyfriend,
just for a little while.

1241
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,765
Just stay down.

1242
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,411
Stay down.

1243
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,006
Look at me.

1244
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,171
Suck this.

1245
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,564
Go fuck yourself!

1246
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,121
If you insult me again,

1247
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,283
I will cut your face off
and wear it over my own.

1248
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,090
Do you understand?

1249
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,726
Ansel!

1250
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,165
You made your bed.

1251
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,725
That's right.

1252
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,890
Now lie in it.

1253
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,731
Now suck it!

1254
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,526
Please.

1255
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,326
Do you want me
to wear your face?

1256
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,001
Now suck it.

1257
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,201
Easy.

1258
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,524
Easy.

1259
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,166
Oh yeah.

1260
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,561
Oh yeah, Here we go.

1261
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,611
Alright.

1262
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,247
Hey.

1263
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,080
Hey!

1264
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,326
What do you think?

1265
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,291
I don't!

1266
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,561
Now listen carefully, both of you.

1267
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,204
I performed a service
for this family.

1268
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,728
And I deserve my payment in full.

1269
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,882
Because of a misunderstanding
with the insurance,

1270
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,764
I won't receive any cash
for my services.

1271
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,565
That is unfair.

1272
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,691
I don't care to hear excuses
or placement of the blame.

1273
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,041
I hold you all equally responsible.

1274
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,730
Reach around and grab my ass.

1275
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,560
Reach around and grab my ass.

1276
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,961
There you go. Grab it, That's it.

1277
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,720
I was fortunate,
however, in thinking ahead.

1278
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,371
I secured a retainer for my services.

1279
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,521
Since I fulfilled my obligation,

1280
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,004
and since my cash
is not forthcoming,

1281
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,250
that retainer is now mine.

1282
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,446
It belongs to me.

1283
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,960
and I'm taking it with me
when I leave.

1284
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,284
You're very good at this.
Please moan.

1285
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:51,330
Chris doesn't agree
with the concept of the retainer.

1286
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:56,808
He's coming here tonight to
attempt to take it with him.

1287
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,801
I can't,

1288
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,041
allow him to do that.

1289
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:12,961
This family can't allow him

1290
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,290
to do that!

1291
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,565
We have to go.

1292
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,889
It's suffocating me.

1293
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,283
I can't be around them any more.

1294
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,843
Do you understand me?

1295
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,368
I'll slaughter all of you!

1296
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,565
If this family allows Chris
to leave this trailer,

1297
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,768
I'll slaughter all of you like pigs!

1298
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,088
Do you believe I'd do that?

1299
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,204
I am asking for your help.

1300
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,125
Will you give it to me?

1301
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,481
Ansel?

1302
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,086
Yes, sir.

1303
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,887
Now, you're a very beautiful woman.

1304
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,928
Don't you think so, Ansel?

1305
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,489
I hadn't given it much thought.

1306
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,126
- No! -
- Wrong answer!

1307
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,087
She's a very beautiful woman.

1308
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,724
And that's sweet.

1309
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,805
Don't you think so?

1310
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,561
Easy.

1311
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,686
Now, hey.

1312
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,606
- I want you to tidy up the kitchen.
- Okay.

1313
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,921
And you're gonna set the table
for a proper meal.

1314
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,001
Okay?

1315
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,566
Get that chair.

1316
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,089
And we're all gonna sit down.

1317
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,324
- for dinner.
- Okay.

1318
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,369
Just the four of us.

1319
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,442
Understand? Look at me.

1320
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,565
Just the family.

1321
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,604
Get that chair.

1322
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,084
How you doing, guy?

1323
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,966
- Where'd you get them pictures?
- Oh, that's hardly important.

1324
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,811
I guess.

1325
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,889
I mean, all she did was suck his cock
and try and steal your money.

1326
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,803
It could have been worse.

1327
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,726
How?

1328
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,240
Well...

1329
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,964
No, I suppose that's
about as bad as it gets.

1330
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,565
Listen.

1331
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,926
Go spend some time with your wife.

1332
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,886
Sharla.

1333
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,521
Yes?

1334
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,765
Are you okay?

1335
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,884
Yes, I'm fine, Ansel.

1336
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,725
Are you sure?

1337
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,890
Yes, I'm sure.

1338
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,606
Okay.

1339
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,844
Shut up, T-Bone!

1340
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,009
Hey, son.

1341
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,926
- Dottie here?
- She's in the bedroom.

1342
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,887
Oh thank God, I'm starving.
You hear from Joe?

1343
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,924
He's in his bedroom.

1344
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,045
You eat already?

1345
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,605
Hi Chris.

1346
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,886
Junior.

1347
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,405
You're home.

1348
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,926
Hi, Joe.

1349
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,404
I ehh, heard about the money.

1350
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,729
I gotta tell you, I'm all broke up
things didn't work out.

1351
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:50,088
- Yeah me, too.
- It's the way the world turns, right?

1352
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,446
Huh?

1353
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,807
It's the way the cookie crumbles?

1354
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,006
Yeah, okay.

1355
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,731
Caveat emptor, you know what I mean?

1356
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,325
Shall we dine?

1357
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,286
Dear.

1358
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:08,289
Smells heavenly. Chris, Ansel,
you hungry for some K-Fry-C?

1359
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:13,211
- I'm not really that hungry.
- Well, you should join us Ansel.

1360
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,645
All of us.

1361
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,202
Chris, have a seat right here.

1362
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,806
There we go. As it should be.

1363
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,446
There we are.

1364
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,321
Sharla, have a seat.

1365
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,281
Thank you.

1366
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,050
This is lovely.

1367
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,768
Who would like to say grace?

1368
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,566
Dottie.
Would you do the honours?

1369
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,165
Mmm-hmm.

1370
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,009
Dear Jesus, thank you for the food.

1371
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,564
Thank you that we're all here
together and safe.

1372
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,724
We're sorry Momma's dead.

1373
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,003
We hope you'll give her a place
to stay in heaven.

1374
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,686
Please forgive us
for anything we did wrong.

1375
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,048
We would all like a place
to stay in heaven, too.

1376
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:17,768
In the Lord's name, which is
Jesus Christ, we say, "Amen."

1377
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,161
Amen.

1378
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,485
That was beautiful.

1379
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,807
Thank you.

1380
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,771
Let's eat.
Sharla, would you grab us some drinks

1381
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,008
and get young Chris a plate please?

1382
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,203
- White and dark?
- Yes please.

1383
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,487
Ansel, get that potato salad started
will you?

1384
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,886
And potato salad.

1385
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,849
- I love potato salad.
- And potato salad.

1386
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,962
Iced tea.
Is that homemade Sharla?

1387
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,441
- Yes, it is.
- I only need one scoop of that.

1388
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,568
Will you get Dottie some potato salad
on there, please?

1389
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:52,484
How about that you start with that
and we'll get you some more

1390
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,562
if you like.
- That's perfect. Can I start now?

1391
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,530
- Yes, you may. Sharla, white or dark?
- It doesn't matter.

1392
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,047
Do you want some potato salad?

1393
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,805
Yes, please.

1394
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,406
- Sharla, potato salad?
- No, thanks.

1395
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,330
- Sharla, your mascara's running.
- Fuck you.

1396
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,571
Everybody.

1397
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,568
I have an announcement to make.

1398
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,369
You've all probably noticed that

1399
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,649
Dottie and I have been spending
an awful lot of time together.

1400
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,604
The fact is, we've fallen in love.

1401
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:31,129
So it's my privilege to tell you that
I've asked her to be my bride.

1402
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,603
And she has accepted.

1403
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,771
- Haven't you, dear?
- Yes.

1404
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,765
- Well i for one would like to say...
- Shut up.

1405
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,761
A toast.

1406
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,609
To my future wife.

1407
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,091
When's all this
supposed to take place?

1408
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,688
Well, we're leaving
right after this delicious meal.

1409
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,205
Is that right?

1410
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,161
Yes.

1411
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,161
You can't have my sister Joe.

1412
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,610
What do you mean, Chris?

1413
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,047
I mean, I can't let it happen.

1414
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,162
You're not gonna marry my sister.

1415
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,085
- I don't think ifs up to you.
- Shut up.

1416
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,640
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- You say another word, old man,

1417
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,961
and I will rip your head
off your shoulders.

1418
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,405
Now, Chris,

1419
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,802
I can certainly understand
your love for your sister.

1420
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,241
But you got to cut the
old apron strings sometimes.

1421
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,642
Okay, I'm not going to discuss it.
She's my sister.

1422
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,608
I'm taking her with me.
We're leaving here.

1423
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,091
We should let Dottie decide.

1424
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,730
Dottie doesn't have
a say tn the matter.

1425
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,241
- Oh, I believe she does.
- You believe wrong.

1426
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,402
Dottie' go get your stuff.

1427
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:50,044
Dottie, stay seated.

1428
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,080
Dottie.

1429
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,402
Stay seated.
Dottie.

1430
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,084
Dottie, sit down.

1431
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,321
Dottie.

1432
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,561
Dottie. go get your stuff now.

1433
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,210
- Dottie.
- Dottie.

1434
