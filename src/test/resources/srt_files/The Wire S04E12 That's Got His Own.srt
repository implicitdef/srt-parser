1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,941
Oh!

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,030
Oh, man!

3
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,628
Fuck.

4
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,110
Fuck.

5
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,181
- What's next?
- One to the head.

6
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,810
I keep it quick.

7
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,049
Not yet, motherfucker.

8
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,649
You shoot live rounds
like paint,

9
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,023
boy, you'll be the shit,
you hear?

10
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,824
Yo, but these really do
look like Glocks.

11
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,888
Yeah, they make them
look that way.

12
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,662
Yo, why you shoot low?

13
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,159
All right, if you're close,
aim for the head.

14
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,105
If not, think vest.

15
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,505
That's the way you said it.

16
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,739
A'ight.
Boy's learning.

17
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,205
- You going inside this one too?
- I'm gonna do the whole block.

18
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,766
It's bad enough
you popped the top

19
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,040
off one house
and give us a body.

20
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,478
What the fuck do you think
you're doing now?

21
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,039
- An experiment.
- An experiment?

22
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,052
Oh, fuck me.

23
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,316
I'm dealing with
Madam Curie here.

24
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,586
This nail here
comes from a nail gun,

25
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,185
and it comes from the house
with a dead man inside.

26
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:32,186
Every other house
has screws that H.C.D. uses.

27
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,359
We find these in the plywood
anywhere in this city,

28
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,096
and there's a body inside.

29
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,833
Gosh, that's good work.

30
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,398
No, I'm very impressed.

31
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,446
Do you see
a tool belt on me?

32
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,345
Do I look like one
of those fucking jerkoffs

33
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,612
in aisle five of
the Home fuckin' Depot?

34
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,119
There's three weeks left
in the year,

35
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,987
and our unit clearance
rate is under 50%.

36
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,753
We do not go
looking for bodies,

37
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,250
especially moldering
fucking John Does.

38
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,491
We do not put red up
on the board voluntarily.

39
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,261
Jay, the bodies
are in the houses,

40
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,269
Marlo Stanfield's bodies.

41
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,498
Then they belong to him.

42
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,631
Now I realize you're
no longer in my squad,

43
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,905
Mr. Major Crimes, but you're still
part of C.I.D., right?

44
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,208
And look,
I'm still a sergeant, right?

45
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,840
And I'm giving you
an order on this, Lester.

46
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,578
Until I feel chain-of-command
down on this

47
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,247
and until you hear otherwise,
you will not--

48
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,688
I repeat not--
pull down any more...

49
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,488
fucking wood!

50
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,132
Let's go, man.

51
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,232
I mean, you know,
I expect a shortfall

52
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,573
when I look at the school budget.
It's a natural.

53
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,705
But how in Christ's name
do you lose $54 million?

54
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,044
One million
at a time.

55
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,674
Exactly. It didn't
happen this morning.

56
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,708
This was
on Royce's watch.

57
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,779
You didn't get a whiff of this
during council review?

58
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,656
You can't blame the council or Royce
for the school budget.

59
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,058
The fiscal responsibility is
with the school board itself.

60
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,120
But the council
does have oversight.

61
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,893
Don't even pretend
to put this shit on me.

62
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,196
Only the city share shows up
on our budget review.

63
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,202
We never see
the state money.

64
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,999
You'd better tell your
pretty new chief of staff

65
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,767
that whatever happens
up on North Avenue

66
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,502
is on the school system.

67
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,941
That's a simplistic
view, I think.

68
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,103
How would you
complicate it?

69
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,581
As president of the school board,
I'll argue this is a bookkeeping issue.

70
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,913
We've simply been rolling the system's
debt over since '99.

71
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,409
You rolled it and rolled it
until it ran out of cash.

72
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,116
That's not bookkeeping,
that's stupidity.

73
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,920
So what are we talking
about here, waste?

74
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,790
Fraud? Embezzlement?

75
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:46,128
I would say that although the system
has some poor accounting practices,

76
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,134
in the end we're going to find
that most of the money

77
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,659
was properly spent
on programming.

78
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,797
Okay okay okay.
We get it.

79
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,832
No one's responsible,
not the school board,

80
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,969
not anybody on North Avenue,
not Clarence Royce,

81
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,036
not the city council,
no one at this table.

82
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,674
Fine.
So what's our next move?

83
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,816
Bump the property tax rate?

84
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,254
Scale back our budget.

85
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,689
No pay hikes, hiring freezes,
reduced services,

86
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,751
tell everyone-- schools,
police, fire, public works--

87
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,922
they have to hold the line
for a year or two.

88
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,558
How?

89
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,262
I just ran a clean-up-the-streets
campaign.

90
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,897
I just got done promising the world
to every cop in the city.

91
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,770
Annapolis.

92
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,072
You go beg
his Republican ass.

93
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,923
The Cheese stands alone.

94
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,689
This the drop?

95
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,094
I hope not, 'cause
they ain't called yet.

96
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,092
Make me feel bad
toward old Prop Joe.

97
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,909
Yeah, go around
where we can see y'all.

98
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,241
Vamonos, 'Naldo.

99
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,063
Nice hookup.
Private.

100
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,928
Damn, y'all some Semper Fi
motherfuckers, ain't ya?

101
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,304
Where Cheese go
to enlist?

102
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,448
That's 25 back to Joe
from what we was short before,

103
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,284
and another 1 50
to up our order to six.

104
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,120
Whoa, we had you down
for four.

105
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,922
I don't know if we got
extras coming off the boat.

106
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,156
Short someone else then.

107
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,164
I'll see what Joe says.

108
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,998
Yeah.

109
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,571
When we set with the re-up,
we'll hit you on that.

110
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,634
The shit will be where you told us
half hour later.

111
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,510
- Yo, we ain't using these no more.
- Us neither.

112
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,606
What we do is ring you
from a 958 exchange,

113
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,708
East Side,
don't need to answer.

114
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,743
Just toss it,
go to the meet.

115
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,153
See you when I see you.

116
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,259
Money on the table,
"hairon" to follow.

117
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,853
Stay here on Marlo?

118
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,023
Nah, we gonna stay
with Cheese.

119
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,707
Detective, would you
get the door for me?

120
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,470
Sometimes life just
gives you a moment, huh?

121
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,133
He was gonna do me,
and instead he gets done?

122
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,766
I'm dipped in shit here.

123
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,073
I'm the luckiest
motherfucker you know.

124
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,635
Gentlemen,

125
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,477
the target is still
Mr. Stanfield,

126
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,176
and from the look
of things,

127
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,582
we're no closer to him
than when I left here two months ago.

128
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,486
Now they might not
let me go after murders,

129
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,650
but they cannot stop me
from chasing the drugs.

130
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,751
Leander, I want you
surveilling his people.

131
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,728
See if they're still up
on cell phones.

132
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,696
How are you
with the paper trail?

133
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,930
- Okay.
- I want you down

134
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,663
at the city assessment office
pulling paper on all the purchases

135
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,672
on the West Side
over $100,000.

136
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,300
Then get down
to M.V.A. and check

137
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,309
Iuxury cars in his name,
all right?

138
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,641
Now this boy has been
in the game for a while now.

139
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,909
He might try
to launder money.

140
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,882
Herc, I want you
on the paperwork,

141
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,181
re-requisitioning
the wiretap equipment

142
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,414
that Marimow shipped
on down to l.S.D.

143
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:06,118
We're gonna need all of that
to get backup, okay?

144
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,955
If anyone needs me,

145
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,224
I'm down at Missing Persons,
all right?

146
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,821
Let's go.

147
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,263
- Lester?
- Yes?

148
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,099
- All this is cool...
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,800
...but you think we can do it
so that the direction comes from me?

150
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:25,333
I mean,
I am the sergeant here.

151
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,213
Donut, you think
this look right?

152
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,149
Why you knock 'em down?

153
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,491
So the police
won't scope me so easy.

154
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,555
But now all they gotta do is be like,
"Yeah, go over there

155
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,124
and just grab that little nigger
with the braids."

156
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,667
Damn, boy, you later
than a motherfucker.

157
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,003
Been sitting out here
watching money walk away.

158
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
You about to have
the day off.

159
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,982
Package was stolen, Na'.

160
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,714
What? Out the back
of your basement?

161
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,154
They kicked my motherfucking door in.
That's how they do.

162
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,319
Well, look,
how the police know

163
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,226
where you even be keeping
your stash at?

164
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,424
Some snitch-ass bitch,
that's how they know.

165
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,524
I'ma find his ass too.

166
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,194
All right, man, I'm out.

167
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,875
I never did understand
why you stopped eating the pig.

168
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,372
I ain't been in a Polack Johnny's
since 1974,

169
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,408
and if you knew what
was good for you--

170
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,012
Look, I know what's good.
I remember when you did too.

171
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,114
I never saw you
going all Muslim on me.

172
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,523
Ain't that, but I do
believe that other faiths

173
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,256
have got the pig figured
better than us A.M.E.s.

174
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,560
See that?
If you checking out,

175
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,395
I might feel the need
to say a few words.

176
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,401
Nah, I ain't got nothing
to do with that.

177
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,369
I love my PJs,
but they do repeat on me.

178
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,066
As memory serves,
you got to go with the original sauce,

179
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,597
not the kraut and chili
like you do.

180
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,639
My pain ain't
about no sauerkraut.

181
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,314
"The Puzzle Palace"
is ready to clip any program

182
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,319
that ain't tied
to the statewide tests.

183
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,447
The thing is, we're just starting
to make a little headway

184
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,457
- in what we're doing.
- You take it upstairs?

185
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,049
Yeah, me and the professor
went all the way

186
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,856
- to go see the school superintendent.
- And?

187
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,590
You read the papers?

188
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,996
They're a little busy
ducking that budget mess.

189
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,091
$50 million in the hole,
and they're scared

190
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,227
to take any more problems
to the new mayor.

191
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,602
- Is your thing a problem?
- Depends on how you look at it.

192
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,402
A cover-your-ass
type of person might say

193
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,137
we're just tracking any students
that can't hack in the regular classes,

194
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,169
giving them work that don't show up
on no statewide tests.

195
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,943
City Hall says it's okay,
they keep our program.

196
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,974
If not, we on the street.

197
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,350
Odell Watkins.

198
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,824
I was hoping
you'd say that name.

199
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,487
Yeah, he got
Carcetti's ear.

200
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,723
If we sell him,
maybe we sell the Hall.

201
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,102
Stalk that nigger, man,
that stole your shit.

202
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,613
- Yeah.
- Soon as he nod out,

203
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,707
bust him in the head
with a brick or some shit.

204
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,651
Nah nah.
That ain't me.

205
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,381
You can always give him
a hotshot then.

206
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,082
Y'all recall Junior Bunk?

207
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,387
Cutting his shit with,
uh, what you call it?

208
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,790
Stole it from
the funeral home.

209
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,589
Oh, you thinking
formaldehyde.

210
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,118
That's the shit.

211
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,721
Nigger's got a taste
of that shit,

212
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,199
university started
a "Junior Bunk" ward.

213
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,101
My cousin laid his ignorant ass
up there two, three times.

214
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,071
Ain't no guarantee
in that, though.

215
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,629
Use some rat poison then.

216
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,699
No, man, that stuff
don't cook up right.

217
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,302
What you need to use
is that sodium cyanide.

218
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,677
That shit looks and cooks

219
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,579
- just like the real thing.
- Where I find that?

220
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,312
Try, uh, Minter's
over there by the tracks,

221
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,479
or one of those metal shops
where they do plating.

222
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,648
- How much I need?
- It ain't gonna take much.

223
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,853
A vial of that shit'd kill every horse
in this stable.

224
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,862
- That's all there is to it?
- It ain't no thing to kill a nigger

225
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,990
who's already about the business
of killing himself.

226
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,967
And the police, they ain't
gonna pay no never mind.

227
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,232
You the one's got
to live with it is all.

228
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,276
More young males
than I'd have thought.

229
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,211
I don't suppose they all went off
in search of adventure.

230
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,778
You get a chance to do any
street work on these files?

231
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,381
Shit, no, Lester.

232
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,291
They cut Missing Persons
to one detective five years ago.

233
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,557
I barely keep up
with the paperwork.

234
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,123
Feel free.

235
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,626
Just make copies and return
the originals for the files.

236
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,663
For the files... right.

237
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,308
Damn, son.

238
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,313
Kenard said
the police took it?

239
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,008
He said they
kicked his door in.

240
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,112
And they ain't
lock no one up?

241
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,213
Yo, you see
that door?

242
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,990
Were the hinges broke?

243
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,826
I mean, if he said
they put the boot to it...

244
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,500
them hinges
gotta be hanging free.

245
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,399
I sweated him, yo.

246
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,030
He wasn't
trying to scheme me.

247
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,874
That little motherfucker
took that shit for himself.

248
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,433
Bet it.

249
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,935
And now you gotta
step to him,

250
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,882
put something real
behind them words.

251
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,553
Where your
Spanish boy at?

252
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,385
He's down on point with Cheese
while I round up soldiers.

253
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,415
You got soldiers
right here.

254
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,950
Your 2255 must have
pleased some judge, huh?

255
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,987
Enough to get me home,
didn't it?

256
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,627
I'm just saying, Butch,
I know they soldiers,

257
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,638
but I'm thinking about
being a little more subtle on this one.

258
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,401
You feel me?
So they don't see me coming.

259
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,638
It ain't like you
to work with strangers.

260
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,440
I'm celebrating diversity.

261
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,413
I'm thinking now the time
to start doing that.

262
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,615
Oh-hoo! What up, shorty?

263
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,176
What's up, baby?

264
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,915
- Mm, mm.
- Mm.

265
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,423
- Damn, girl, you looking good.
- I'm maintaining.

266
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,426
- Shit, I know that's right.
- You doing all right?

267
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,757
Yeah.

268
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:19,252
Long time, long time.

269
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,392
I got your word. Some real money
to be made on this one, huh?

270
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,459
You remember
how to do this?

271
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,903
I reckon it'll
come back to me.

272
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,100
See that's what
I'm talking about, Butch--

273
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,609
- subtle.
- Hmm.

274
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,109
Glasses first,
so they don't spot.

275
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,119
Yes, ma'am.

276
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,454
- Hello.
- Ho, Mr. Prezbo.

277
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,657
- Come in, please.
- Oh, that's okay.

278
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,394
I just wanted to stop by
on my way home

279
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,402
and drop off Randy's
work for next week.

280
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:01,167
Hopefully this thing
will be over soon.

281
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,107
Maybe so, but we're looking
at the possibility

282
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,577
of moving him to Booker T. Washington
next semester.

283
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,409
I hope
that isn't necessary.

284
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,416
I hope so too. Anyway, thanks
for bringing this.

285
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,179
I'll try to keep him
up to speed.

286
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,278
- Hang in there, kiddo.
- Thanks.

287
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,048
Long conference call.

288
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,785
About an hour
so far by my watch.

289
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,055
Got me out here
riding the wood.

290
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,153
Unfortunately
the governor's phone call

291
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,358
has gone longer
than anticipated.

292
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,162
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

293
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,260
Look, I have
other appointments.

294
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,669
It shouldn't be
much longer.

295
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,709
Check out Fisher's
column in Metro.

296
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,441
He says,
the governor thinks, quote,

297
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:20,315
"This latest fiscal emergency
calls into question

298
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,480
the Baltimore school system's
ability to manage itself

299
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,616
as well as the local
oversight of the system,"

300
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,216
unquote.

301
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,662
Motherfucker.

302
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,528
He's playing
to the D.C. suburbs.

303
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,159
He sees you coming for him
two years from now.

304
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,726
He ain't no fool.

305
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,001
There's all your electronic
requisitions right there.

306
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,703
Mm-hmm.

307
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,847
What one's that, a cop?

308
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,008
Nah, security guard.

309
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,041
I don't think he's
one of Marlo's, though.

310
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,849
Lieutenant.

311
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,687
Will someone explain to me
what the fuck the brass is doing?

312
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,785
First I get bounced
to telephone reporting,

313
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,386
then I get
a call this morning...

314
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,260
How's that beach house
coming, huh?

315
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,562
It's almost done.
I just need a load of lumber--

316
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,158
That's great,
just great.

317
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,931
Welcome.
Welcome back.

318
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,977
Who the fuck is that?

319
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,642
That, Sergeant Hauk...

320
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,151
is one of the most
effective supervisors

321
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,312
in our police department.

322
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,821
Sorry. It's just taking a little longer
than we expected.

323
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,353
It shouldn't be
much longer, though.

324
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,124
I understand
what you're saying.

325
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,159
Some of those kids
are ready for high school,

326
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,831
but not Duquan.

327
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,841
- I've...
-...adopted him?

328
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,775
I've noticed Duquan
this semester.

329
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,904
He's more nourished,
wears fresher clothes.

330
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,380
Sometimes he even
smells like soap.

331
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,509
You and your wife,

332
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,610
you don't have children,
do you?

333
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,883
- Not yet, no.
- Well, have some.

334
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,822
For better or for worse,
they're yours for life.

335
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,121
The kids in this school
aren't yours.

336
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,220
You do your piece with them,
and you let them go.

337
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,131
Because there'll be plenty more
coming up behind Duquan,

338
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,159
and they're gonna
need your help too.

339
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,467
You've got your third period
in five minutes, right?

340
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,339
Settle down.
Settle down.

341
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,544
We need to concentrate
on these tests.

342
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,281
- Aw, fuck this, man.
- Talking about, "lf Jane's father

343
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,289
gives Jane one week's
worth of allowance..."

344
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,518
Shit, I ain't got
no allowance where I stay at.

345
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,254
No father, neither.

346
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,525
How many sides a sexagon got?
Why I care about that?

347
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,862
You need to take the test
so you can move on to the next level.

348
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,060
I ain't moving nowhere
but out this motherfucker.

349
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,663
- Hell, yeah.
- All right. Let's settle down.

350
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,003
Let's start with
question number one.

351
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,838
Settle down!

352
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,182
All right.
All right, listen up.

353
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,945
Here's the problem:

354
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,576
Two couples go
into a restaurant.

355
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,814
- They get the check--
- Yo, when they say "couples,"

356
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,914
- do it mean they married?
- Why they got to be married?

357
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,084
Mr. Prezbo, why you
even get married?

358
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,391
Well, to build a life
together, for one--

359
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,897
you know, family.

360
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,399
- Also to have intimacy.
- What do that mean?

361
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:28,066
- Mean, like, getting some.
- No no. It's not just that.

362
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:32,099
Intimacy can be, um,
a quiet conversation.

363
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,339
Or it can be fun,
you know?

364
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,074
Like when you tickle
your partner.

365
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,049
Yo, tickle my nuts.

366
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,820
All right, all right,
no more of that.

367
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,293
Come on, let's get
to the test material.

368
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,954
The statewide exam
is next week.

369
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,760
And then we'll get back
to the regular lessons.

370
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,460
Can we talk
about intimacy?

371
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,095
If you like, and if I don't
get too embarrassed.

372
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,874
All right, uh... so,
the grand total on the check

373
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:08,005
is $67.40, but if they
want to leave a tip--

374
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,475
Look at your
sample test, please.

375
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,042
I got to say, Ms. Duquette,
I feel like y'all schemed us.

376
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,111
This class is the same
as the ones down the hall.

377
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,850
Yeah, it's 'cause
the test's coming up.

378
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,154
Okay, class, let's take a look
at the sample math test.

379
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,717
In sample "A",
we start with...

380
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,626
Kid's right.
This is bullshit.

381
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,790
The test material doesn't
exactly speak to their world.

382
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,528
Yeah, don't speak
too loud to mine, either.

383
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,968
An estimate,
Detective.

384
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,561
We start opening
those houses,

385
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,631
we might turn over
a couple of dozen bodies,

386
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,336
but that's
just me guessing.

387
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,673
All of them homicides?

388
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,043
The boy took over
half the West Side.

389
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,378
We never saw the violence.

390
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,941
This right here
is the reason why.

391
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,681
You're asking us to call out
half of public works

392
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,315
and pull the plywood off
thousands of vacant houses

393
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,019
all so we can raise
the city's murder rate by 10%?

394
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,153
What else are we doing
on Stanfield?

395
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,322
I'm trying to get backup
on his people's cell phones

396
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,161
as fast as I can.

397
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,099
And I started to look
for his money.

398
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,968
But if I'm right about this,
they have to be worked.

399
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,202
Is there any evidence at all that
links all these missing-persons reports

400
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,005
to the Stanfield
organization?

401
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,443
I'm just starting at that.
The one body

402
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,414
that we pulled out of the Fulton
Avenue house is Lex.

403
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,883
His case is a direct tie.

404
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,216
And there are two other names
on those missing persons reports

405
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,984
that show up in our wiretaps
from earlier this year.

406
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,958
So, yes, there are links,
Counselor.

407
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,120
By any chance did Landsman

408
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,753
run this up the chain
to you guys?

409
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,229
No.

410
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,565
Your call.

411
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,662
My office won't care
until they see case files.

412
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:52,708
I'll run it upstairs
and we'll see what comes.

413
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,688
- Okay, I get it.
- He's still tied up,

414
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,922
but it really should only be
a little while longer.

415
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,692
Can you tell the governor
I have to go back to Baltimore?

416
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,029
I have a little bit
of business today.

417
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,270
I'm the mayor of a major American city,
for chrissakes.

418
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,829
How much shit do l
have to eat from this guy?

419
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,205
Wouldn't you play the politics
if you were him?

420
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,233
It's not like the state
had no role in this thing.

421
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,802
You know, the state money for those
schools had no oversight either.

422
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,643
But I'm not telling
"The Washington" fucking "Post,"

423
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,947
talking about how he might be forced
to bail me out because--

424
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,852
what was the quote again?

425
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,153
Because "Those are my children
in Baltimore too."

426
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,824
He's gonna bleed me
for that money.

427
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,488
Mayor Carcetti?

428
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,125
The governor's office says he's
ready to see you now.

429
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,795
$54 million's a big number.

430
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,474
We won't go until we get some,
we won't go until we get some--

431
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,615
Did I do
something wrong?

432
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,981
I ain't acted up or nothing.

433
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,622
You're ready for this.

434
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,954
You can do the work.

435
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,789
I know you can.

436
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,955
And if you need
to come back here

437
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:50,331
and use the showers
or give me laundry,

438
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,826
use the computer,
you can do that any time.

439
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,634
Anyway,
let me show you.

440
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,338
This here's the way
to the hard drive.

441
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,575
This isn't
necessary, Duquan.

442
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,085
Just in case
I'm busy, Mr. P.

443
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,952
So you know
how to work it.

444
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,014
Hey, boy.
What's up?

445
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,285
Big day for you.
See here?

446
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,019
I got the inventory
divided between us.

447
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,460
You gonna go up one way
towards North Avenue...

448
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,464
and I'm gonna stay down
by the highway.

449
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,557
You gonna let me handle
the money alone?

450
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,967
- You ready, ain't you?
- Yeah, I'm good.

451
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,735
All right.
Let's get on it.

452
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,242
I see you
back here tonight.

453
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,868
All right.

454
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,715
Hey hey, you see that foul motherfucker,
you let him have his money, okay?

455
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,377
I don't need you
messing with him.

456
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,750
- All right.
- All right.

457
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,278
Make sure
that count's right!

458
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,418
Yo, I need to talk to
the little motherfucker.

459
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,088
Maybe you can
do that with me,

460
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,757
see it don't
get out of hand.

461
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,790
Hey! Yo, Mike!

462
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,961
Yo, what up, Duke?

463
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,972
Yeah, I heard Randy's foster ma
gonna take him out of Tilghman too,

464
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,067
send him somewhere else.

465
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,668
That's messed up, man.

466
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,141
All right,
holla, man.

467
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,076
How many?

468
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,610
As a theory,

469
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,589
Detective Freamon
believes there could be

470
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,092
additional bodies in those vacants,
maybe a dozen or more.

471
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,186
- He believes?
- Lester Freamon is not in the habit

472
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,787
of selling woof tickets.

473
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,628
I, for one,
would not bet against him.

474
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,295
And what do you suggest
I do with this information?

475
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,133
My feeling is

476
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,766
that City Hall should be
brought into the loop.

477
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,799
We pull the bodies now
before New Year's,

478
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,471
and the stats go to Royce's
last year in office.

479
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,139
Matter of fact,
it gives Carcetti an advantage

480
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,978
with regards to
next year's crime rate.

481
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,814
- You mean--
- Tell the mayor that now is the time

482
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,650
to empty those houses,
not next year, when it's on his watch

483
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,417
and he has to eat the stats.

484
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,121
Colonel, I see you've
thought this through,

485
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,097
politically, I mean.

486
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,397
- I'm learning as I go.
- I bet you fuckin' are.

487
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,804
Colonel, keep this
conversation close.

488
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,707
That's a direct order.

489
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,178
You seen them girls
at Douglass, man?

490
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,181
Yo, you right, Duke.

491
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,513
Ain't gonna be like
middle school no more.

492
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,451
You know,
I'm just thinking, yo.

493
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,049
Dag, man, not again.

494
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,660
Where your
people at now?

495
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,239
Need any of your
stuff from the pile?

496
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,743
It ain't no thing.

497
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,743
Yo, man, listen.

498
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,249
Me and Bug got
our own spot now,

499
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,411
so you could come
crib with us if you want.

500
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:41,659
What you mean
Kenard took the stash?

501
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,667
And he's still
walking around?

502
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,568
I'm gonna talk to him, Ma,
make sure this never happen again.

503
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,196
Look at me, boy.

504
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,436
Kenard got to feel
some pain for what he did.

505
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,740
- He got to.
- I don't--

506
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,507
You don't what,
motherfucker?!

507
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,606
This how you pay me back
for all the love I showed?

508
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,586
Shit, I been kept you in Nikes
since you were in diapers.

509
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,713
- I'm trying.
- You trying, huh?

510
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,485
That's what you
gonna tell your father

511
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,685
the next time you see him,
that you trying?

512
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,422
Or you gonna tell him
what you've done?

513
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,657
What he done
got him locked up--

514
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,567
That's right. Wee-Bey walked
in Jessup a man,

515
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,127
and he gonna walk out one.

516
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,401
But you out here,
wearing his name,

517
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,102
acting a bitch!

518
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,010
Aw, look at you,
crying now.

519
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,945
Fuck you think you going?

520
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,921
Get your ass back here.
I ain't done talking to you.

521
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,155
I mean, I'm police, right?

522
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,994
Murder police,
and I got bodies.

523
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,364
I'm just supposed
to let them laying lie?

524
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,165
"We don't throw red up
on that board voluntarily."

525
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,331
That John-Goodman-
off-his-diet-looking

526
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,705
motherfucker
was clear on that.

527
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,200
- So go over Landsman's head.
- Mm, Jimmy, that's you--

528
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:06,012
send an anonymous fax. But you see,
Lester here don't fancy boats.

529
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,678
And me, I get sick
just filling the bathtub.

530
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,654
It's just wrong.

531
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,782
Yeah, just like when I seen J-Lo with
that little itty-bitty Spanish dude.

532
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,988
Genius. He hid his mausoleum
right in the neighborhood.

533
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,724
How little Pedro gonna
fill that big thing up?

534
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:23,131
Oh, man, that girl got
a prime cut of ass, boy.

535
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,692
- And a good heart.
- A good inverted heart.

536
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,637
This nail's
like their signature.

537
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,139
Find it in any door
in the West Side,

538
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,641
and right as rain
you're gonna find a body.

539
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,669
Yes, sir. I'm proud to be
chasing Mr. Marlo Stanfield.

540
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,050
Man, you act like you on the trail
of Pol Pot or some shit.

541
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:44,384
- Who?
- Motherfucker, I got $10 says

542
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,151
we can leave here
right now,

543
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,454
go to any boarded-up
rowhouse

544
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,017
with a nail like that
in the door,

545
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,359
and we will find a body.

546
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,298
- Make it $20.
- There you go.

547
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,824
Well, but first let's have another
little taste. Jimmy, you in?

548
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,666
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, come on, man.

549
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,264
Take that skirt off and have a drink,
for chrissakes.

550
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,433
- Drink that.
- Agh!

551
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:08,377
Man, don't play
like that. Aww.

552
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,781
Icicles, get 'em
before they melt!

553
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,647
Icicles!

554
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,628
Icicles, come get 'em!

555
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,323
Icicles!

556
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,961
Hey, yo, Kenard.
Why you lie to me?

557
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,527
Fuck you talkin' about?

558
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,129
You said the police
kicked your door in.

559
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,471
I seen the door.
They ain't kicked shit in.

560
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,533
- How you gonna lie?
- Go on, man.

561
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,808
- Yo, where the package at, man?
- Package up my ass, gump.

562
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,542
- I'm about to--
- You about to?

563
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,211
Go on, walk,
gump-ass motherfucker.

564
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,378
Hey, yo,

565
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,620
Iook at that little dude
getting his ass beat!

566
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,757
Y'all was talking too goddamn much.
Go ahead, Na'.

567
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,360
Get your pack off
this bitch so we can go.

568
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,129
I don't want it.

569
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,972
I don't want it.

570
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,343
I'll take that
20 now, Bunk.

571
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,945
I can't see shit in here.

572
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:28,755
Aw, man. I might pull out
my wallet, reach in,

573
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,454
and pull out
a $25 by mistake.

574
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,293
I need me some
Braille bills, something.

575
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,335
Hmm.

576
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,244
You ladies want
to call the Crime Lab?

577
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,146
Nah, man.

578
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,983
I'm like Stevie: too high.
You know I can't do no scene.

579
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,012
Well, there's not gonna be one,
on account of there is no body,

580
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:02,253
not until the bosses say there is.
And when that happens,

581
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,887
you gonna miss
all the fun, junior.

582
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,760
You know Daniels is gonna
keep this alive.

583
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,130
The white shirts will fuck it up
somehow. You know it, Lester.

584
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,999
Maybe not, this time.

585
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:15,233
Daniels is C.I.D.
It's a new day downtown.

586
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,968
I got it.

587
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,476
Whew,
world is on its hole

588
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,411
when Jimmy McNulty is
the most qualified to drive.

589
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,815
Yeah, up is down,
black is white... Ieft is right.

590
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,332
What we got here, huh?

591
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,606
- Quiet overnight.
- Cool.

592
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,633
Relief will be here
for you after roll call.

593
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,751
It's Sergeant Carver.

594
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,930
How you doing, dawg?

595
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,106
Quiet overnight.

596
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,801
You going to school
this morning?

597
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,639
We're gonna wait a little
longer on that to be sure,

598
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,406
but I can't say
I'm comfortable

599
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,673
going to work every day
and leaving him here.

600
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,238
Blow over in a week
or so, you'll see.

601
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,750
Till then we still have
a car on the house,

602
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,844
and you have my cell number
if anything comes up.

603
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,186
We're gonna look out
for you on this.

604
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,920
- Have you had breakfast, Sergeant?
- No, but I gotta--

605
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,655
You have time
for a plate, I'm sure.

606
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,661
Sure.

607
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,169
Yo,

608
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,366
I just dreamt something
gave me an idea today.

609
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,471
Hey, Sherrod.

610
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,282
You remember when
we turned that knocked down

611
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:44,448
Iight pole at the scales?
Pulled $80?

612
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,286
I been thinking
we can get to toppling

613
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,123
a couple of those
bad boys ourselves,

614
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,653
get all Paul Bunyan
and shit, you know?

615
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,457
I mean, we'll be all
discreet and all.

616
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,970
Not take the hacksaw
to no more than a couple

617
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,907
on some quiet streets,
leave more than enough

618
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,604
for some people
to have light and all.

619
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,577
Thing is,
I got this other thing

620
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,914
I still need to
take care of today.

621
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,248
Come on, Sherrod.
Wake up.

622
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,748
It's late.

623
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:38,139
No no no!
What you do? What you do?

624
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,905
What you do?

625
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,346
Aw, man, come on,
Sherrod.

626
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,148
Come on, man.
Come on. Come on.

627
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:52,620
You weren't supposed
to do this, man!

628
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,423
Oh, man!

629
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,957
- No phones?
- Not a one.

630
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,902
And the players that
were using them before--

631
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,632
Chris, Monk, Ray-Ray--

632
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,401
they were out there
on those corners.

633
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,636
Now I would have seen if
someone went to a burner.

634
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,473
God damn it!

635
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,640
If we just stayed up
on the wire two months ago,

636
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,842
we wouldn't be
going through this sh--

637
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,720
Can I help you?

638
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,620
Which one of you
is Sergeant Hauk?

639
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,284
I am.

640
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,054
I'm Shea.
This is Thomas. I.I.D.

641
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,755
Let me ask
if you remember

642
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,026
pulling a surveillance
camera from l.S.D.,

643
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:40,003
serial number AW466J9.
You remember that?

644
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,902
We also need to go over
your paperwork

645
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,600
on a couple of informants,

646
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,007
so if you don't mind
coming back downtown with us,

647
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,102
you and...

648
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:52,343
Detective Sydnor
and the third guy,

649
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,375
what's his name?
Dozerman.

650
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,352
You don't need
Sydnor or Doze, either.

651
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,950
Paperwork's all mine--
on the camera,

652
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,393
on the informants,
me alone.

653
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,133
Bodies?
How many?

654
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:18,300
Could be quite a few. We won't
know until we take down those doors.

655
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,310
And this is one drug organization
you think did this?

656
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,972
That's the theory, but nothing's
certain at this point.

657
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,038
What is certain is that
if we're going to do this,

658
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:28,813
you probably want us to do it now,
before the new year,

659
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,320
while the bump
in the murder rate

660
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,322
is still attributable
to Mayor Royce.

661
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,154
Thoughtful, Deputy,
very thoughtful.

662
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,786
I don't want any more stat games
from your department.

663
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,023
You need to get your people
into those houses because if there are

664
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,897
bodies in there,
they need to come out.

665
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,561
But do it now.

666
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,163
I don't want to be finding
any more bodies come January.

667
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:52,039
Yes, sir,
Mr. Mayor, sir.

668
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,948
Choice comes down to this:
We take the state money,

669
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,920
and instead of being
fucked up and broke,

670
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,423
our schools go back to being
merely fucked up.

671
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,620
No teacher layoffs, no program cuts,
no school closures.

672
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,322
But the price
the governor's asking is

673
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,159
more state control
over the school board

674
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,098
and changes in the teachers' union
contracts that would allow them

675
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,762
- to remove tenured faculty for cause.
- Ouch.

676
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,237
If we don't take the money,
it looks like we're shorting our kids.

677
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,706
We take the money-- we're giving up
local control of education,

678
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,301
which is gonna lose us
a lot of middleclass black folks.

679
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,074
Not to mention the problem
you might have two years from now

680
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,808
running in the D.C.
suburbs,

681
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:06,645
explaining how you
needed their money

682
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,618
to bail out
your schools.

683
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,745
He sees you coming, Tommy.

684
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,018
That's not
important right now.

685
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,287
Take the money.
We need it.

686
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,360
Don't look at me.
If you take it,

687
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,630
you're selling out the teachers,
and that's my base.

688
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,001
If you don't take it,
you're selling out the kids.

689
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,337
Either way, I'll probably rip you,
and half the council will too.

690
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,707
Just glad
I'm not the mayor.

691
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,811
- You called?
- Word down the chain: Open 'em up.

692
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,656
And it's my guess this case
is gonna need more manpower.

693
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,523
Yeah, no doubt.
In fact,

694
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,654
I might have lost Herc
to an l.I.D. file.

695
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,824
Really? I went light
on him for that car stop.

696
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,959
I didn't even think
it would get to a trial board.

697
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,165
This feels like
a bigger jacket.

698
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,106
Pick any two you want
from C.I.D. for now.

699
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,268
If you get back up on a wire,
we'll detail a few more.

700
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,971
Beautiful.

701
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,943
I don't know what
you're talking about,

702
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,611
but she was hot.

703
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,918
I'm going back on Friday
right after work.

704
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,822
Hold on.

705
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,455
What the fuck
are you staring at?

706
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,829
How are you
liking Homicide?

707
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,664
Loving it. Why?

708
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,362
Anyway.

709
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,307
It's on the way, boss.

710
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,650
It's Joe
and his message,

711
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,488
but we already know
what it is.

712
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:04,256
All right, girl.
Keep it close.

713
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,361
All right, 'Naldo, call your amigos
and tell them it's on.

714
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,784
That's right.

715
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,586
Yep. That's it.
One, come on.

716
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,592
Let me see
that footwork.

717
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,618
That's it.
One, one,

718
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,223
one, one.
That's right.

719
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,800
Yo, what's going on,
Mike?

720
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,242
Man, yo, I feel like
I could just pancake

721
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,302
a young'un right now,
you know what I mean?

722
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,913
What about you, Duke?
Want some go?

723
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,082
No, I'ma
work this rope.

724
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,092
Yeah, you working it.
Like a gump.

725
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,167
They pull around back,

726
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,611
we're gonna come at 'em
from both ways, feel me?

727
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,076
Ooh.

728
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,081
Hey, yo, call your friends,
tell 'em where we at.

729
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,428
Yo, let me get that rope.
I said I'm workin' it.

730
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,158
Man, I said you's a gump,

731
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,258
fucking dogshit
and smelling-ass nigger.

732
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,759
Hey. Hey! Hey!

733
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,141
Man, fuck this.

734
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:57,306
Yeah! Go along! Get!

735
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,338
Don't nobody want you
in here, no way!

736
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,317
You see what happened?

737
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,328
That be it.

738
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,937
Hey, Daddy.

739
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,569
Kiss the butt
of this lyricist.

740
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,203
Blow on my mike
and make a wish.

741
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,079
Get up! Everybody, get up.

742
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,645
Get up!

743
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,277
Let me get a $10, Daddy.
Let me get a $10. I need a $10.

744
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,311
Get the fuck
out of here, now.

745
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,484
- Come on, I'll suck your dick for $15.
- Trick-ass bitch, I said get.

746
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,425
Don't you want
to see my stuff?

747
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,326
Nah, ain't nobody
want to see that stink box.

748
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,354
- Get your ass gone.
- Come on, let me get a $10, player.

749
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,161
What the fuck is this,
the lnner Harbor?

750
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,895
Yo, what the fuck y'all
think you doing?

751
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,766
- We painters.
- Si, we paint.

752
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,236
Move the van out the way.

753
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,069
Oh, you gonna like
what I got, soldier.

754
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,209
See? We paint.
We paint.

755
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,976
Oh... okay.

756
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,981
Which one of y'all
gonna open the truck for me?

757
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,256
Fucking amateurs.

758
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,462
Drink it slow, son.

759
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,068
What am I gonna do?

760
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,907
I'll run you home.

761
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,608
I-- I can't go home.

762
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,783
She expect me
to be my father, but...

763
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,090
I ain't him.

764
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,058
I mean, the way
he is and shit...

765
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,023
it just ain't in me.

766
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,457
What's between
you and Michael?

767
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,400
Mike ain't Mike no more.

768
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,170
He went hard
on this boy last night,

769
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,867
fucked his shit up.

770
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,910
I can't go home.

771
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,881
I can't.

772
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,476
Give us a minute.

773
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,792
Mad at myself, man.

774
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,819
I shouldn't have shut
Michael out like I did.

775
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,494
Namond did push it.

776
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,524
He ain't pushing
nothing now.

777
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,964
Reckon I'll go
mend the fence.

778
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,338
This ain't no motel.

779
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,413
Deacon, how'd you
get by my people?

780
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,183
You can't turn away church folk,
ain't done in these parts.

781
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:30,091
You only come by
for a favor, so what is it?

782
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,460
You know a fella
named Bunny Colvin?

783
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,829
Yeah, that rogue
police commander,

784
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,595
tried to legalize drugs.

785
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,330
- What's he done now?
- He can tell you best.

786
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,066
You did not bring--

787
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,165
It's something
positive, Odell.

788
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,234
- Has to do with kids.
- Positive, huh?

789
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,041
Bunny.

790
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,174
Delegate Watkins.

791
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,706
What's this all about?

792
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,049
It's another bright idea.

793
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,161
- You Michael Lee's mother?
- He got papers on him or something?

794
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,959
I ain't no kind of police.

795
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,694
- I'm just looking to get up with him.
- You ain't alone.

796
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,668
He booked on out of here,
got his own spot,

797
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,693
took his little
brother with him.

798
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,229
- You know where he stay at?
- He ain't tell me nothing.

799
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,299
You find the boy, you let him know
I need some help around here.

800
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,934
I popped him
and Bug out my ass,

801
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,104
and now they forgot
where they came from.

802
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,441
What my ma say
when you called?

803
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,510
She was mad, right?

804
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,181
Not really.

805
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,392
His mother...

806
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,334
Lovely lady.

807
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,896
What she say?

808
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,432
"Put that bitch in baby booking
where he belongs,

809
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,502
Iet him learn
something."

810
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,376
She hung up
before I could

811
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,042
tell her we didn't
have a charge.

812
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,047
Baltimore City 911.

813
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,183
Yeah, they beating a cop
over here on Pennsie and Gold.

814
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,989
- Police officer?
- Yeah, they're beating on him bad.

815
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:14,087
- Pennsylvania and Gold?
- Yo, they firing shots now.

816
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:24,733
Signal 13, report of shots
fired, Pennsylvania and Gold.

817
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:26,332
Signal 13--

818
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,534
They cleaned
the motherfucker out, Joe,

819
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,096
put it in the van them Mexican
niggers rolled in.

820
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,040
I ain't hearing
about no resistance.

821
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,702
Man, wasn't
no time for that.

822
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,871
Omar had one of them
commando squads with him, man.

823
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,437
I mean,
he had this one ho

824
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,880
pulling guns
out her pussy, Unc.

825
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,440
The shit was unseemly, man.

826
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,078
I got to hand it
to Mr. Little,

827
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,214
- I ain't see this one coming.
- They took the shipment, Joe.

828
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,156
Not no package, man,
the motherfucking shipment.

829
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,716
Man, what we gonna
tell the co-op?

830
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,921
Hey, where you think
my mind at right now?

831
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:21,487
All I know, it's a lot of gangsters
out a lot of shit, man.

832
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,432
I say we mob up and go
find this faggot, see?

833
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,368
That's what's really 'hood right there.
That's how you deal with shit.

834
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:31,966
A lotta gangsters in that room need to
take us at our word first.

835
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:36,308
Yeah, first thing
they gonna wonder about...

836
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,678
is us.

837
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:47,414
You need to see my man.
I'll hook you up.

838
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,015
Who is this motherfucker?

839
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,617
Let me get
a word with you, Mike.

840
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:55,189
Listen, you got
to understand

841
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,995
I can't be having
no physical confrontation

842
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,558
Iike the one took
place back there.

843
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,470
That kind of thing
got to stay outside my gym.

844
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,439
Yeah. Go ahead, Montel.

845
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,135
I come to tell you
I was wrong,

846
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,110
the way I handled it.

847
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,635
Step off, nigger.

848
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,580
Mike...

849
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,951
Don't touch me, man.

850
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,955
Look, man,

851
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,116
Man don't want you

852
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,784
Mike.

853
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,456
I told you,
step the fuck off.

854
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:29,795
Young man, if I was talking
to you, you'd know I was.

855
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,027
Shit!

Go ahead, man.
Do him.

858
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,008
Nah, man.

873
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,589
