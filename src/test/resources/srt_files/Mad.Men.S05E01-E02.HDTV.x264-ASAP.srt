00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:03,990
You're going to Vietnam!

3
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:06,878
I think I'd like eventually
to do what you do.

4
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,953
Every chip I make we become
less dependent on you!

5
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:13,159
- Why you...
- Roger...

6
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:17,087
- I have made the best of this.
- This is not my home.

7
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,301
Feel him.

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,568
The Mohawk Airlines is over.

9
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:23,818
Don't stop.

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,563
I'm late.

11
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:26,656
Me?

12
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:27,999
He's been gone for seven weeks,

13
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:29,272
it can't be his.

14
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:30,445
When can I start looking?

15
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:32,294
I'm so in love with Greenwich.

16
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:33,800
Will you marry me?

17
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,215
Yes!

18
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,923
Things aren't perfect.

24
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:37,125
Shut up!

25
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:41,196
- Get a job!
- Somebody call the cops.

26
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:43,299
That's all there is--
cops and negroes and priests.

27
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:49,439
You're walking in a circle.

28
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,875
Must be hot out there.

29
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,180
What are you doing?

30
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,121
You hit one.

31
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,195
Hey, watch the work.

32
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,537
To the men's room.

33
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,339
Less promises, more money!

<i>Less promises, more money!</i>

35
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:26,248
Do you know somebody's throwing
water bombs out your windows?

36
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,450
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,952
Everybody saw it was
coming from this floor.

38
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:32,387
We all saw it.

39
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,123
This is the executive floor.
That's utterly ridiculous.

40
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,124
Don't you call us ridiculous.

41
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:40,161
Is this what Madison
Avenue represents?

42
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,103
And they call us savages.

43
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,102
What are you doing up?

44
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:49,437
I thought this
was the bathroom.

45
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,339
It's down there.

46
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:54,275
Okay.

47
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,746
You want breakfast?

48
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:07,789
Happy Birthday.

49
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,891
Oh, thank you.

50
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:11,726
We should wait for his cake.

51
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:15,529
We're not gonna be here
on his actual birthday.

52
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:16,831
Thank you.

53
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,665
It's from all of us.

54
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,104
We'll go to the deli for dinner
tonight and have cherry cheesecake.

55
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,707
- Open it now.
- Yes, ma'am.

56
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,676
- Can I turn the bacon?
- No.

57
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:33,746
I love it.

58
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:36,716
Good morning, everybody.

59
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,150
- Good morning.

60
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,986
- Hi, Megan.
- Hi.

61
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:46,058
That's so nice.

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,527
He needs one of those.

63
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:51,197
It's a badger--
from its tail.

64
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,833
- What are we doing today?
- We're going to the Statue of Liberty.

65
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,535
You always say that,
but we never do.

66
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:58,671
You hungry?

67
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,807
Just black coffee for me.

68
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:20,296
Okay, everybody.

69
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:22,331
Have a Happy Birthday.

70
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,767
Thank you, Sals.

71
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:26,569
How old are you gonna be?

72
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:28,238
40.

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,307
So when you're 40,
how old will I be?

74
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,409
You'll be dead.

75
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,144
We're not gonna see
you next weekend,

76
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:37,413
but we'll see you the weekend after.
That's the 11th.

77
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:39,615
- If you say so.
- You'll be 70.

78
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,684
That's right.

79
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,986
You're not gonna come in?

80
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:47,255
No. But give Morticia
and Lurch my love.

81
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:51,859
Flick the porch light
when you get there, all right?

82
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,927
- All right.
- Good night, animals.

83
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,463
Say good night, honey.

84
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:58,298
Good night, daddy.

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,400
Get your brother's hand.

86
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,637
Bye.

87
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:37,872
You're losing your head there.

88
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,908
Dandruff.

89
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,778
It's spit-up.

90
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,379
I saw your wife
dropping you off.

91
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,914
Such a sweet scene.

92
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,150
Yes.

93
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:52,084
She has quite a smile.

94
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:54,220
She's getting back to herself.

95
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:56,155
How old's the kid?

96
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:58,525
I thought it would be
a little faster.

97
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,260
Does she cry all the time?

98
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:01,961
No.

99
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,130
She just...

100
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:09,301
There was a time when she wouldn't
leave the house in a robe.

101
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,206
Listen, there's a point

102
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:17,210
when you go from going home
on the 5:25 to the 7:05.

103
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:20,346
If you finally
learn how to drive,

104
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:22,715
you can push it to 9:30.

105
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,751
You're getting
the wrong impression.

106
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:26,920
Or not come home at all.

107
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,057
Beth and I got into it
so bad the other night,

108
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,727
I just jumped in the car
and drove.

109
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,030
Made it all the way to
some motel in Rocky Hill.

110
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,733
Put my fist through a wall.

111
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:42,169
Howard, don't get
emotional again.

112
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,504
Maybe she's right.

113
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,506
Maybe I am a little selfish.

114
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,508
I said I needed time
with my thoughts.

115
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,278
She asked me what
I do at work all day.

116
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,448
They don't understand.

117
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:08,862
<i>Greenwich.</i>

118
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,365
<i>Next stop, Greenwich,</i>
<i>Port Chester, Rye...</i>

119
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,569
Who am I kidding?
It's nothing a little peace wouldn't fix.

120
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,371
There you go.

121
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,581
Morning.

122
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,285
Of course.
I'll let him know.

123
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:32,087
- Was that for me?
- No.

124
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,522
- Who was it?
- Really?

125
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:35,424
Fine.
What's Don up to today?

126
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:37,226
I see a lot of napping
and pillow talk.

127
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:38,927
That's your schedule.

128
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,763
You all had the status
meeting 20 minutes ago.

129
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,400
Can't you sit over there
once in a while?

130
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,102
What if I have someone
important coming in?

131
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,503
When you have somebody come
in, I will sit over there.

132
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:52,607
Here, why don't you
buy yourself

133
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,709
a fancy hat or a mask
or something?

134
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:57,511
No, thank you.

135
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:59,414
All I'm asking for
is a few hours a day

136
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,449
where the world might mistake
you for my secretary.

137
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,618
Joan said you were
supposed to share.

138
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,053
- And his phone rings more.
- Joan's not here.

139
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,455
And you just took $50 from me.

140
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:11,192
Let your conscience
be your guide.

141
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,038
That feels good.

142
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,540
That feels so much better.

143
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,942
Yeah.

144
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,014
I was right.
Somebody was very wet.

145
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:37,450
When you were that size, I
used to change you every hour

146
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,086
whether you needed it or not.

147
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,390
I don't know how many times
I have to say this.

148
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:45,326
Those go in the cabinet
in the hallway.

149
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,295
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:49,397
I thought it'd be easier if
they were near your bathroom.

151
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,466
I didn't mean it that way.

152
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:53,402
I haven't slept.

153
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:56,672
And I just feel
cooped up in here.

154
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:58,407
I think it's bad for
Kevin to be out there

155
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,776
until I'm done cleaning
the oven-- the fumes.

156
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:03,412
I don't know why you had to
do that on a hot summer day.

157
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,247
Anyway, I think we're about
to run out of formula.

158
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:11,353
Hello.

159
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:14,356
Hello, you.
You're gonna take a nap.

160
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:17,259
Would you like that?
You want to lay in the bed with mommy?

161
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,500
A 10?

162
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,269
You buying his
formula or yours?

163
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,405
I'll take him for a walk.

164
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,541
Oh, God, would you?

165
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,479
You're gonna go
with Grandma Gail.

166
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:38,548
That's where you're gonna go.

167
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,628
Close the door.

168
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,311
How was everybody's weekend?

169
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,746
Great. We all went
water-skiing together.

170
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,149
- Made a human pyramid.
- I was here.

171
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:16,685
Splendid. So I trust you're adequately
prepared for the Heinz presentation.

172
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:19,455
Yes, boss.
We have almost everything.

173
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:21,557
Mm-hmm. Just short
Mrs. Draper's work.

174
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,226
- She's writing the coupons.
- Has Don signed off?

175
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:26,961
He's late.
And so is she, coincidentally.

176
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,331
Clara.

177
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,235
Clara!

178
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,703
She should have just
rolled over and said,

179
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,806
"Don, what do you
think of this?"

180
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,441
I bet she says that
every morning.

181
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,313
Come on, it's 11:00.

182
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:50,486
No sunbathing?

183
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,688
No.

184
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,792
Look, we had
a three-day weekend

185
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:58,128
and you didn't do anything?

186
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,929
That's not my calendar.

187
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,065
Clara.

188
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,502
- How was your weekend?
- Clara, is Mr. Draper in yet?

189
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:09,604
- No.
- You're late for the status meeting.

190
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:12,407
You should probably go prepare
instead of molesting my secretary.

191
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,976
Well, sweetheart,
the torture's over.

192
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:17,044
Let the fun begin.

193
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,815
My office is 30 yards away.

194
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:23,351
So when I hit that buzzer,
I'm trying to save myself

195
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:25,653
a trip through the miracle
of telephonics.

196
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:28,356
Mr. and Mrs. Draper
are here.

197
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,893
- Good morning.
- So sorry. I overslept.

198
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,695
That's not true.
I did.

199
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:36,564
How was Memorial Day?

200
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:38,398
It was nice.
We had my kids.

201
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,304
You had the status
meeting at 10:00.

202
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,776
- Morning.
- Good morning.

203
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:51,413
Did you read about
Y&R's paper bag drop?

204
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:53,682
I did.

205
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,917
- I don't see the humor.
- It's funny.

206
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,653
I mean, if nothing else, it serves
them right for stealing Pond's.

207
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:00,822
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

208
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,857
They stole the Pond's account
and now they're a laughingstock.

209
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:05,860
- Makes me feel better.
- Gentlemen.

210
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,929
Shall we mosey on over
to the conference room?

211
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,665
- We did have a meeting at 10:00.
- Morning, Lane, clipboard.

212
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:14,335
We should run a want ad
saying something like,

213
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:17,171
"Sterling Cooper, an equal
opportunity employer."

214
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,273
Our windows don't open.

215
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,642
As tempting as it sounds,
I don't know if we need to be

216
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,878
spending money to further
their embarrassment.

217
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,415
Look, if there's no line item
for humiliating the competition,

218
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,150
Don will write it
and I'll pay for it.

219
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,286
But you're not
allowed to read it.

220
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,922
Forget the want ads.
The advertising column.

221
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,524
I want them to see it.

222
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:36,993
So, Heinz is coming in.
Don?

223
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:40,697
Yes. Caroline, can you get Megan
and the Heinz boards, please?

224
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,365
- Do you want the team?
- No.

225
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,935
- What else?
- Status is status quo on my end.

226
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,870
I'm supposed to have drinks with
Bruce Lewis from oldsmobile.

227
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,173
He wants to know if there's
a way around nader.

228
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,341
There isn't.
Anything else?

229
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,477
Lane?

230
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,179
I have a lunch at the 4A's,

231
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:59,616
so I should be back in time but
not necessarily conscious.

232
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:05,155
And according to the memo,
Kenny finally has signatures

233
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:07,657
from Chevalier, Galone
and Butler Shoes.

234
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,060
Footwear.
All good news.

235
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,263
I suppose that brings
this meeting to a close.

236
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,165
Don, may I speak
with you privately?

237
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,634
Uh, I should take a look
at these right away.

238
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,805
Mr. Campbell.

239
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:24,840
I have a call of nature.

240
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:27,943
Do not begin this meeting
without me.

241
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:30,979
When is he free next?

242
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:36,251
You obviously haven't seen
my coupons yet.

243
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,554
- Let's get out of here.
- No.

244
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,457
Then lock the door.

245
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,192
As soon as I'm in here
longer than five minutes,

246
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,061
people will start to...

247
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,364
What?
Who?

248
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:50,334
I have to get these to Peggy.

249
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,336
You have a presentation,
you know.

250
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:02,647
I could make you go home right now,
you know. I have that power.

251
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,817
<i>Mr. Campbell</i>
<i>is here to see you.</i>

252
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:09,187
- I just saw him.
- I have to get back to work.

253
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,055
Open your blouse.

254
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,358
You're a dirty old man.

255
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,102
- Anything else?
- No, ma'am.

256
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,474
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

257
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:31,042
I asked for your first
available meeting,

258
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,411
and it turns out you have
nothing to do today.

259
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:37,048
If you could have any client in
the world, who would you want?

260
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,917
- American Airlines.
- Why?

261
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,986
- Because they stood us up.
- Right.

262
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:43,989
So I started thinking, who has
those feelings about us?

263
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,893
Mohawk Airlines.

264
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,795
You were very close.

265
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:51,830
The company's in
a lot of trouble.

266
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:55,233
It's very nice that things have not
gone well since we cut them loose.

267
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:56,734
They want to come back?

268
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,438
After the way
we treated them...

269
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,141
So that American Airlines
thing isn't happening?

270
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:04,610
- I, for one, am very excited.
- Oh, me, too.

271
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:07,113
I just don't understand
the secrecy or the urgency.

272
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:10,216
I'm meeting with them today, and
I think you should drop by.

273
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:12,886
Hank Lammott hit me pretty
hard on his way out the door.

274
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,621
I may not help.

275
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,857
Don, you're the big draw.

276
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,360
They're not going to ask
for someone else.

277
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,529
Look, get through this,
get them back for more,

278
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,832
and I'll make time
in my busy schedule.

279
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,301
Got it. I'll let you know
when I need you to...

280
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,636
It's a good idea.

281
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,907
Can I get some coffee?

282
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,577
Oh, Megan, you're here.

283
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,589
I took a risk on one of them.
Two for 22¢.

284
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,192
Nice.

285
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:53,661
Of course, we're really
locked into the 5¢ off,

286
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,730
but good thinking.

287
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,100
Stan, can you do
something to these?

288
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,504
Like what?

289
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:06,641
I don't know.
Do that thing with the border

290
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,876
around the edge so it kind
of looks like legal tender

291
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,846
with the can of beans
where Washington goes.

292
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,282
You want me to put
a little wig on him?

293
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,084
Play with it.

294
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,686
Drop dead.

295
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,821
They keep asking me to be
more and more specific

296
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,324
until you're
drawing it yourself.

297
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,059
- Do you want me to move?
- Oh, no, no.

298
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,261
- I'm just looking for gum.
- Oh, I have some.

299
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:37,638
So I have to ask your
opinion about something.

300
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,707
You did a great job,

301
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,242
but I can't really go
overboard on coupons.

302
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,545
I did that kind
of baloney for two years.

303
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:45,913
You should take comfort
in the fact that

304
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:48,882
it's very important to
the client-- too important.

305
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:52,385
No, it's something else.

306
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,554
Tomorrow's Don's birthday.

307
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:57,957
Oh, shit.
It's June 1st?

308
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:00,860
Ugh, I forgot.

309
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,462
Got to get him something.

310
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:04,564
I still haven't gotten
you a wedding present.

311
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:07,000
Sorry. You know
how busy I've been.

312
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,803
No, it's just, um...

313
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:14,474
I'm throwing a party
for him on Saturday.

314
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,277
It's a surprise.

315
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,347
Oh, okay.

316
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,116
For Don?

317
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:23,518
Yes.

318
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,553
Men hate surprises.

319
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,355
Didn't you have
"Lucy" in Canada?

320
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,890
Look, nobody likes it
in theory,

321
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:30,725
but people are always glad.

322
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,261
And you've never
seen me throw a party.

323
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:36,897
Everyone's gonna home from this
and they're gonna have sex.

324
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,600
Okay.

325
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,936
Sounds like fun
for us at least.

326
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,805
I mean, if I'm invited.

327
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,540
I don't want to assume.

328
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,843
You're invited.
I'm not sure who else is.

329
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:53,647
I went through his rolodex.
I crossed out all the clients

330
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,349
and everyone he's fired.

331
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:59,552
That doesn't leave
a lot of people.

332
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:02,389
Freddy Rumsen doesn't
come to parties.

333
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,026
- You have to invite Harry.
- I know,

334
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:09,428
but he really doesn't like him.

335
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,764
Really?

336
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,532
I didn't say anything.

337
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:17,402
- Frank Keller, his accountant?
- He likes him.

338
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,973
There are six phone numbers
for Herman Phillips.

339
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:23,643
- Is he important?
- That's Duck.

340
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:29,550
What birthday is it?

341
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,852
40.

342
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:54,941
How'd he do?

343
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,610
He was fussy the whole time.

344
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,745
But the elevator
always knocks him out.

345
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:03,349
Must be the vibration.

346
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:06,252
Who would have thought
you'd be so good at this?

347
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:09,288
You'll be good at it,
too, sweetheart.

348
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,690
What am I going to do
when you go home?

349
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:14,326
Are you really going
back to that office?

350
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:15,961
You worked.

351
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:18,663
I had to.
Your husband's a doctor.

352
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:22,134
It doesn't matter.
I promised and they need me.

353
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:24,269
I'm not saying you're
not important to them,

354
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:26,739
but they also know
that priorities change.

355
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:29,141
- They should, anyway.
- Why are you doing this?

356
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:32,712
You don't know how sick you're going to
feel inside or what you're going to miss.

357
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:35,015
What he's doing now,
that's nothing.

358
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:37,450
- Just wait.
- I know, I know.

359
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,886
I just--

360
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:42,855
I don't want
to break my promise.

361
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:45,591
And Greg will be stationed at
Fort Dix for a second year.

362
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:47,793
- I can commute from New Jersey.
- And then?

363
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:51,830
And then when he's done,

364
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,598
we'll see.

365
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,300
Joan, he's not going to
allow you to work.

366
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,936
Allow me?

367
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:03,108
Whither thou goest, I will go.

368
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,478
And how did that
work out for you?

369
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,103
Ah, Pete Campbell.
Late as usual.

370
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:27,339
He obviously didn't
come in on a Mohawk plane.

371
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:30,009
- Hank. Jack.
- You're not late.

372
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:32,344
- Roger told us to come early.
- Hmm.

373
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:35,114
Have a seat. You're only one
behind, but they're nuclear.

374
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,352
Roger, they're looking
for you back in the office.

375
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:42,488
- It'll keep.
- We were just laughing about Y&R.

376
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,291
It couldn't have happened
to a better bunch of bigots.

377
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:51,097
Roger, it's an emergency.

378
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,999
Really?

379
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:55,101
Oh, come on.
We just got started.

380
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,574
All right, all right.
Sorry, fellas.

381
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:04,077
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

382
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,315
You don't want me to fly
copilot or be your wingman?

383
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:11,218
Check your valises?
Hold your airsickness bag?

384
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,621
Do you want me to throw one
into the bag you're in?

385
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,690
You enjoy yourself, then.

386
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:18,360
Garcon, assume that
these are gone.

387
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:20,596
I should warn you
about these two--

388
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,531
- They're a thirsty lot.
- Always a pleasure.

389
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:25,901
When you're done with him, just fold
him up and slide him under the door.

390
00:22:29,507 --> 00:22:31,673
I love that guy.

391
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:40,214
And so we take advantage of
this new microphotography

392
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:42,983
and high-speed camera
to show...

393
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,054
A bean ballet.

394
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:56,029
Spinning in air with their
delicious perfection,

395
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:58,431
<i>the beans pirouette</i>
<i>in slow motion,</i>

396
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,834
they somersault in slow motion.

397
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:04,004
Some of them spin clockwise,
some counter-clockwise

398
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,973
so they'll appear to be
moving towards each other.

399
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:09,109
Until...

400
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:13,145
They drop into a full can
first seen from the top.

401
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:17,315
There's a splash of
mouth-watering sauce

402
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:19,517
as each one lands.

403
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,188
Then we cut to the front,
the iconic label.

404
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:29,461
"The art of supper."

405
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:39,173
Have you done this before,
this special photography?

406
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:42,176
It's been done before, but
you'll be the first on TV.

407
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:45,613
How do they get the beans to do that?
They can't just get lucky.

408
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:48,949
This camera can show
a bullet spinning in midair.

409
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:51,384
Where's the bite and smile?

410
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:54,187
Ken, you said there'd be
a bite and smile on the phone.

411
00:23:54,189 --> 00:23:56,889
I think I said there was gonna
be a bean ballet, Raymond.

412
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:59,358
But I'm sure we can add that.

413
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,294
And what do they
take away from it?

414
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:04,696
It puts beans on their mind.

415
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:07,633
It's an unforgettable image.

416
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:10,202
And believe it or not,
it makes them exciting.

417
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,607
And it'll show you have
a sense of humor,

418
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:16,542
because, really,
they're being portrayed

419
00:24:16,544 --> 00:24:19,312
as far more important
than they are.

420
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:22,149
You ever see beans up close

421
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:25,152
they're slimy. They look like
a bunch of bloody organs.

422
00:24:25,154 --> 00:24:28,688
And it's not just for fellas like
me that saw things in Korea.

423
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,358
Kidney beans are
called kidney beans

424
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,426
because they're
shaped that way.

425
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:36,729
But you could call
all beans that.

426
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:40,299
They look better
in a group, in a bowl.

427
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:42,635
Hell, what's wrong
with a spoon?

428
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,804
Don.

429
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:47,506
- Well, hello, Don.
- Hello, Raymond.

430
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:49,674
Good to see you.
Are you as excited about this as we are?

431
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:52,010
I don't know.

432
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,879
You said to be bold.

433
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,647
Nothing on TV is going
to look like this.

434
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:57,581
And just imagine seeing
one of these dancing beans

435
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,183
on the subway wall.

436
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:01,519
People will hear the music
in their heads.

437
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,489
Look, it's very artistic.

438
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:08,892
And I want to be bold,
but this isn't what I had in mind

439
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:11,762
when I was talking about a
new generation of consumers.

440
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:14,298
The ketchup kids,
are they even going to notice this?

441
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,368
I mean, that waltz alone
reminds me of old people.

442
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,703
Maybe I wasn't clear.

443
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:22,306
This is temporary music.
We can change it.

444
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:24,308
It's got no message.

445
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:30,882
I can see your point.

446
00:25:30,884 --> 00:25:34,519
Beans is the war,
the depression,

447
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:37,489
bomb shelters.
We have to erase that.

448
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:41,060
They have to be cool.
Don, you know what I'm talking about.

449
00:25:41,062 --> 00:25:44,197
I want the kids in college.

450
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,732
It's convenient.

451
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:48,434
They have the hot plate.
They're sitting in.

452
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:52,170
Okay.
We'll work on that.

453
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:57,709
Maybe it's someone with
a picket sign saying,

454
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:00,811
- "We want beans."
- You know what, Raymond?

455
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,680
<i>This is our job from here on out.</i>
<i>We'll make you happy.</i>

456
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,585
<i>I'm really sorry about that.</i>

457
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:10,754
Please, this is a process.

458
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:13,957
Let me walk you out.

459
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:27,537
What else you got?

460
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,773
That was the best thing so far.

461
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:32,042
Unless you like
this beans protest.

462
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:33,477
Please, you can't be
surprised that that man

463
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:36,347
- doesn't have a taste for ballet.
- It's a joke on ballet.

464
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,449
And you can't be surprised he
doesn't have a sense of humor.

465
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:40,952
I'm not.

466
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:42,587
But I guess I thought
you'd come in here

467
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,822
and tell them how good it was.

468
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:47,892
Do I really want to waste an hour
and a half shoving it down his throat

469
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:50,494
only to have him pull
the plug at the last minute?

470
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,230
This is business that
came in over the transom.

471
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:56,967
We didn't pitch it.
He has every right to make us work for it.

472
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:58,735
I wish I would have known that.

473
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:00,937
I would have saved this
for round two.

474
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:03,105
We'll get him next time.

475
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,154
Caroline.
Is he in?

476
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:19,656
He's gone for the day.

477
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:21,525
Ha!

478
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:27,197
Ah! Oh!

479
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:30,366
Damn it.
Clara.

480
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:33,669
Clara!

481
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:36,071
Oh, my goodness.
What happened?

482
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:39,541
- You want me to get some tissue?
- No.

483
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:42,210
I want you to tell me why
Roger Sterling was at my meeting.

484
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:44,479
- I don't know.
- I know.

485
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:47,816
Because he hovers over
your desk like a damn U-2.

486
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:50,385
- What?
- You think he's looking at your breasts?

487
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:53,556
He's looking at my calendar.

488
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:55,558
Did she hit you?

489
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,762
Thank you, Clara.
You've done enough damage for today.

490
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,300
You need to lower your voice.
Have a drink.

491
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:05,269
No, no more drinks.

492
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:08,872
- Heinz looked miserable.
- They're making us work for it.

493
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:11,708
Don didn't seem worried.
Did you crash with Mohawk?

494
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,376
No, it was perfect.

495
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:17,213
Except for my deep nausea
and pending headache.

496
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:20,015
Oh, and Roger made
an appearance.

497
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:22,584
Well, that shows
it's a good lead.

498
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:24,153
It's my lead.

499
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:26,488
Wasn't Roger in the service
with Henry Lammott?

500
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,290
Did you do any rowing?

501
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:31,394
- You rowed?
- I was a coxswain.

502
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:34,297
The boat moved because everyone
pulls in the same direction.

503
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:36,200
I'm not supposed to worry
about Roger.

504
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:38,369
I'm supposed to worry
about other agencies.

505
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:40,705
You shouldn't be worried at all.
Business is stable.

506
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:42,640
Stable is that step backwards

507
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:44,943
between successful and failing.

508
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:46,979
Fine, Pete.

509
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,081
Just don't be impatient.

510
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,949
You know how this works
from here on out.

511
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,384
We start with a bunch
of piddly shit.

512
00:28:52,386 --> 00:28:54,120
Your topaz,
your white knight cologne.

513
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:57,491
We add your mid-sized stuff.
Maybe Mohawk.

514
00:28:57,493 --> 00:28:59,293
We still got Vicks.
That's big.

515
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:01,662
Next, we worm our way
into a few niche companies,

516
00:29:01,664 --> 00:29:05,133
get something sexy in a good
neighborhood, a pharmaceutical.

517
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:07,402
Maybe if God
is gracious, a car.

518
00:29:07,404 --> 00:29:10,605
And then we go public,

519
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:12,607
open an office in Buenos Aires,

520
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:15,410
and Elvis plays
at Tammy's Sweet 16.

521
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:19,614
Kenny Cosgrove writes another
great American novel.

522
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:21,715
You know it didn't hurt
to have Roger warm them up.

523
00:29:21,717 --> 00:29:23,718
There's no one better
at turning a meeting into a bender.

524
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,887
And they love his pickled guts.

525
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:31,258
Am I going to see you
at Chez Draper on Saturday?

526
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,693
I wish I could get
overtime for it.

527
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:47,005
You ready?

528
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:49,608
- We're almost done, actually.
- Do you need her?

529
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,845
No, it's okay.
It'll be here in the morning.

530
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:55,281
- Great.
- Big weekend plans?

531
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,453
It's Tuesday.
I don't know.

532
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:02,255
I was talking about me.

533
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:04,725
My cousin's coming in.

534
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:07,127
Stan, assume that
you're working.

535
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:11,765
Good night.

536
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:16,135
You're amazing.

537
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:17,637
It could have been worse.

538
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:19,272
I almost said, "I'm sorry
I can't make it."

539
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:21,941
- You're not going?
- No, my cousin's on shore leave.

540
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:25,277
He's only got two days.
A little notice would have been nice.

541
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,145
I would have loved
to have seen the look on Don's face.

542
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:29,448
You almost just saw it.

543
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,985
Like we have nothing
else to do.

544
00:30:32,987 --> 00:30:35,088
Did you believe him in there?

545
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,323
The guy didn't like it.
What was he supposed to say?

546
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:39,759
What he usually says.

547
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:42,762
"Hey, buddy, you got such great
ideas, open your own agency."

548
00:30:42,764 --> 00:30:44,764
The clients are right
all of a sudden?

549
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:46,332
I don't recognize that man.

550
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:49,436
He's kind and patient.

551
00:30:49,438 --> 00:30:51,437
And it galls you.

552
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:54,541
No, it concerns me.

553
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,178
Where are you going?

554
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,080
I've got tickets
to the bean ballet

555
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:02,450
and the curtain's
about to go up.

556
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:05,086
Never gets old.

557
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,828
You're home late.

558
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:32,501
I thought I was going to have
to walk home from the station,

559
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:36,204
but luckily there was
a cab driver leaving a bar.

560
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:38,607
How was your day?

561
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:41,677
I didn't want to disturb you.

562
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,746
Oh.

563
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:46,782
This becomes a home the minute
you walk through that door.

564
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:50,419
There's no fruit
to my labor, tweety.

565
00:31:50,421 --> 00:31:52,255
Well, I suppose
none of this counts--

566
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:55,058
An acre of land,
a wife, a child.

567
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,160
That has nothing
to do with work.

568
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,830
I'm ungrateful.

569
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:03,500
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:06,636
Dissatisfaction
is a symptom of ambition.

571
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:09,572
It's the coal that fuels the fire.
You know that.

572
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,979
Do you really want a dog?

573
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:19,249
Maybe just a beagle
to scare off gophers.

574
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:22,753
We'll see.

575
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:25,655
Oh, luckily my parents
can baby-sit Saturday.

576
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:28,892
Now tell me the truth.
Did Megan really just invite you today?

577
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:30,760
She did.
I don't know about everyone else.

578
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:34,431
Well, she's very impulsive.
We know that.

579
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:37,534
I have to go to bed.
Tammy will be up in a hour.

580
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:39,236
Go ahead.

581
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,465
Attention, party guests.

582
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,636
Hello.

583
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:13,506
We're T-minus
five minutes or so.

584
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:17,244
So if we can bring things
down to a sotto voce,

585
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,680
that would help.

586
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:22,016
I'm gonna turn off the lights.

587
00:33:22,018 --> 00:33:24,018
No!

588
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,921
Well, fine.
Just keep it down.

589
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,291
My God, is he queer.

590
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,327
He reminds me
of Lane's brother.

591
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,737
Ah!

592
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:46,174
Finally.

593
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,043
We're gonna go
inside in a second.

594
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:50,312
You're the one that dragged
me out to the restaurant.

595
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:53,382
Come on.

596
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:01,157
<i>You have to knock.</i>

597
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:03,192
- You have to knock to get in.
- What if it's started already?

598
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:05,762
It doesn't matter if it's started,
you still have to knock.

599
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,034
No.

600
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:12,769
We were just in
the neighborhood.

601
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:16,172
And my mother always said
never show up empty-handed.

602
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:21,343
Oh, damn it.

603
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:23,278
No.

604
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,580
<i>Calice.</i>

605
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,321
Surprise!

606
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,624
<i>Sorry, I blew it in the hall.</i>

607
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:39,393
Aw!

608
00:34:39,395 --> 00:34:41,661
But I am very surprised.

609
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:58,612
I have to say that I am honored

610
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:01,615
and touched to be included
in this group of intimates.

611
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:05,185
And I predicted this,
did I not?

612
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,421
This.

613
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:12,359
Who is this?

614
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,861
Oh, that's my wife.

615
00:35:16,164 --> 00:35:17,998
- Nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

616
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,401
The domino theory
is not a joke.

617
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:24,304
The Vietnamese
are fighting a civil war.

618
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:26,473
There is no monolithic
communism.

619
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:28,542
- It's an excuse.
- Really?

620
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:32,012
Come on, Bert.
It's for profit.

621
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:33,713
Bombs are the perfect product.

622
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,115
They cost a fortune
and you only use them once.

623
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:39,952
So I suppose this young man here is
coming home in a bag for nothing.

624
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,053
If he's lucky.
You ever read "Johnny got his gun"?

625
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:43,855
No eyes, no ears, no nose,

626
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,823
tapping out his last
wishes in morse code

627
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:49,160
with his deformed head.

628
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:51,963
I thought there we
going to be girls here.

629
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:02,974
For purely selfish reasons, I want
to thank you for excluding Joan.

630
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:05,776
I would have had to buy
earplugs for the ride home.

631
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,978
It wasn't up to me.
Can't you tell?

632
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:15,017
Hell of a party.
Jennifer couldn't make it.

633
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,520
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, she couldn't get a date.

634
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,157
Anyway, I know
she said no gifts,

635
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,493
but I got you this.

636
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:26,294
Open it.

637
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:29,999
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

638
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:32,668
It's a silver-handled
walking stick.

639
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,537
Oh, look, he got you a cane.

640
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,541
Don Ameche has one.
It's a steinway walking stick.

641
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:39,944
You could stick it up
your ass and have a concert.

642
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:42,413
Thank you very much.

643
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:45,083
Oh, my God, really?

644
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:47,051
Oh, a negro homosexual,

645
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:49,554
a Canadian sexpot
and unaccompanied redhead.

646
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:51,956
I think this may be
my key demographic.

647
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,493
Hello.

648
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:59,829
Don't.
Just leave it alone.

649
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:03,098
I know. You're wondering
what they're laughing about.

650
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,635
It's not you.

651
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:20,249
Well, I for one think
you're very brave, Megan.

652
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,150
My mother always said

653
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:25,054
a woman should surprise
her husband every day.

654
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:28,056
That's why they had
no lock on the WC.

655
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:30,059
It's true.

656
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:34,262
Look at you delivering drinks.

657
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:35,898
We should get you
a pair of roller skates.

658
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,466
Roger, I didn't know
you were invited.

659
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:40,002
Or did you just hear
I was coming and show up?

660
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:44,339
Is he going bald?

661
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:53,616
It just goes on and on.

662
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:55,652
It's beautiful,
but it's very loud.

663
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:58,088
Listen, you can hear the
traffic even over this party.

664
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,956
I know.

665
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,725
Who cares?
I just want to take my pants off

666
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:04,428
and slide my ass
on the carpeting.

667
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,563
How's the summer treating you?

668
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,731
Well, it's been good
because it's been bad.

669
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:11,267
- What do you do exactly?
- He's a journalist.

670
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:13,803
Underground papers mostly.

671
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:15,571
You may not have seen it.

672
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:17,873
And what exactly has been bad?

673
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:21,009
Well, I don't know.
Four riots in three cities in two months.

674
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:23,912
It is terrible.

675
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:27,016
And lord knows the police
aren't much help.

676
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:30,186
I was raised sex, politics, and
religion aren't party talk.

677
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,088
Well, what does that leave?

678
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,624
I don't know.
Alcohol and work?

679
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,460
Mmm.

680
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:37,795
Hello again.

681
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:40,198
Trudes, which one
is Jane Sterling again?

682
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,201
Mm, the glamour puss
with the tan.

683
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:47,472
Marry early and often.

684
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,443
We're thinking about smoking some
tea with Megan's friends out there.

685
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:53,711
Will you keep
an eye out for Don?

686
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:55,480
As long as you're
just thinking about it.

687
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:56,748
You should join us.

688
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,683
Kenny gets brave
and recites poems.

689
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:00,752
And she thinks they're good.

690
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:09,437
Oh, absolutely.

691
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:11,406
Megan was the best
waitress they ever had.

692
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:13,541
No, but I did get
the best tips.

693
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:16,177
- How did you manage that?
- She laid on that accent.

694
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,179
You know, she's
a really good actress.

695
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:20,915
Not good enough, obviously.

696
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,551
<i>- Julia, come here for a second.</i>
<i>- Hello there.</i>

697
00:39:23,553 --> 00:39:25,320
Hello.

698
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,956
- Glad you could come.
- Great party.

699
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:30,058
You got a great spread here.

700
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:35,864
I just wanted to
make sure we said hi.

701
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:39,200
I can't stay that long.
I have to go back and redo the Heinz pitch.

702
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:43,404
But I guess you know that.

703
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:48,442
Come on, Don.

704
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:53,346
What are you doing?

705
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:55,549
Was that bad?

706
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:58,585
Hell, look who you're talking to.
How do I know?

707
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:03,557
Okay, everyone.

708
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:06,060
My friends.

709
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:08,596
First of all, I wanted to
thank you all for coming.

710
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:10,231
And second of all,

711
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,367
I think I've had
just enough to drink

712
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,070
that I'm ready to give my own
present to the birthday boy.

713
00:40:15,072 --> 00:40:17,406
Oooh!

714
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,908
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.

715
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,643
I think we should
call it a night.

716
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:23,646
Absolutely not, Don.

717
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:26,283
You stay there.

718
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:29,186
Did you buy him a pony?

719
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:37,427
<i>Un, deux, trois, quatre.</i>

720
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:33,117
<i>Oui, oui!</i>
<i>Oui!</i>

721
00:42:21,232 --> 00:42:22,565
Happy Birthday, baby.

722
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:32,075
Why don't you sing like that?

723
00:42:32,077 --> 00:42:34,177
Why don't you look like him?

724
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:46,221
<i>Je m'appelle</i> Roger.

725
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:49,557
- If I may raise a glass.
- Happy Birthday, Don!

726
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,127
As I was saying--

727
00:42:52,129 --> 00:42:54,062
to Megan

728
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:56,165
for letting us see
the Don Draper smile

729
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:58,234
usually reserved for clients.

730
00:42:58,236 --> 00:43:00,103
Hear, hear!

731
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:04,241
And to Don,
you lucky so and so.

732
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:08,813
As a wise man once said,
the only thing worse

733
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:12,784
than not getting what you want
is someone else getting it.

734
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:21,060
Okay, now, no one has
called and complained,

735
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:24,730
so there's no reason
everyone shouldn't dance.

736
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,354
I should probably clean up.

737
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:50,289
Leave it for the girl.

738
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,058
She doesn't come till Monday.

739
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,295
Call her and have
her come tomorrow.

740
00:43:55,297 --> 00:43:56,896
And Monday.

741
00:43:56,898 --> 00:43:59,599
Problem solved.

742
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,701
Did you have fun?

743
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:05,137
Move over.

744
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:07,206
No, I just want to sleep.

745
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,875
Oh, come on.
I know you had a good time.

746
00:44:09,877 --> 00:44:12,077
I can see it.

747
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,746
I don't want to talk.
I just want to go to sleep.

748
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:16,614
Hey.

749
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:27,758
Don't waste money
on things like that.

750
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,094
It was my money

751
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:32,496
and you don't get to
decide what I do with it.

752
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:36,434
Well, cod you please not
use it to embarrass me again?

753
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:40,572
What?

754
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:42,508
I know why you're upset.

755
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,310
You're 40.

756
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:45,511
I've been 40 for half a year.

757
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,485
This is your birthday now.

758
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:55,289
Fine, I don't like my birthday.

759
00:44:57,025 --> 00:44:59,126
I told you, I never had it
when I was growing up

760
00:44:59,128 --> 00:45:02,697
and I've never wanted it since.

761
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,166
You never had a birthday?

762
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:07,301
Didn't Betty ever
throw you a party?

763
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:09,036
No, because I forbid it.

764
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:11,171
Why?

765
00:45:11,173 --> 00:45:13,640
I don't need to be
the center of attention.

766
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:16,643
You love attention.

767
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:19,680
You twitched every time
I talked to another person.

768
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,085
More people feel the way
I do than the way you do.

769
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:26,722
Where's your research?

770
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,360
Fine, I'm 40.

771
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,230
It's too late.

772
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,167
Aw.

773
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:40,470
Nobody loves Dick Whitman.

774
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:42,673
I love you.

775
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:45,075
That's why I threw you a party.

776
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,385
I'm going to sleep.

777
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:56,988
You can do what you want.

778
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:09,667
Excuse me.
Someone's left--

779
00:47:09,669 --> 00:47:12,604
There's a wallet here
from some previous passenger.

780
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:15,574
Oh, I'll turn it in to dispatch.
They got a lost and found.

781
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:21,948
There's close to $100.

782
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,250
Yeah, it happens all the time.

783
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:31,291
I'd-- I'd feel better

784
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:33,393
if I saw to its return.

785
00:47:35,863 --> 00:47:37,330
You're putting me
in a jam here.

786
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:39,332
The guy's gonna call
looking for it.

787
00:47:44,938 --> 00:47:47,106
That's me.

788
00:47:49,543 --> 00:47:53,412
You know what?
You do what you got to do, mister.

789
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:55,682
Oh, that's for you.

790
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:09,095
High tides and heavy surf

791
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,196
<i>battered the coast</i>
<i>of North Carolina day.</i>

792
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:14,099
Force 40 winds and heavy
<i>rain forced evacuation</i>

793
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:17,135
<i>along the coast</i>
<i>as far inland as three miles.</i>

794
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:55,072
That was quite a soiree.

795
00:48:55,074 --> 00:48:57,241
Did Masters and Johnson
come in yet?

796
00:48:57,243 --> 00:48:59,243
They haven't passed by.

797
00:48:59,245 --> 00:49:00,978
I should come and sit down,

798
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,748
so I can see them
slink in in shame.

799
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,617
You seem to be in fine spirits.

800
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,053
Well, I didn't get into
too much trouble on Saturday.

801
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:12,524
Plus, Mohawk called me
at home this morning.

802
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:15,060
Ah.

803
00:49:15,062 --> 00:49:17,663
<i>I hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce,</i>

804
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:19,131
<i>but I have your wife.</i>

805
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:21,667
- Which line?
- <i>Three.</i>

806
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:23,902
- <i>It's blinking.</i>
<i>- They're all blinking.</i>

807
00:49:23,904 --> 00:49:26,638
- <i>Three.</i>
<i>- If you don't mind.</i>

808
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,707
I've called
a partners' meeting.

809
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:34,378
Hello, dearest.

810
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,647
Look, I know you were
upset when you left,

811
00:49:36,649 --> 00:49:38,982
and perhaps I'm overreacting.

812
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:40,450
Becca, dear,

813
00:49:40,452 --> 00:49:43,721
this is why I don't like
you opening the mail.

814
00:49:43,723 --> 00:49:46,591
I only want to ensure that
Nigel is enrolled in the fall.

815
00:49:46,593 --> 00:49:48,393
Nigel's enrollment
isn't an issue

816
00:49:48,395 --> 00:49:50,529
whether we pay now or not.

817
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:53,332
Then why would they attach such
a threatening letter to a bill?

818
00:49:53,334 --> 00:49:56,970
Wouldn't you rather have your money in
June than September if you were them?

819
00:49:56,972 --> 00:50:00,440
Well, I worry about them
saving his spot for him,

820
00:50:00,442 --> 00:50:02,609
especially with his marks.

821
00:50:04,345 --> 00:50:06,146
I assure you that
St. Paul's is aware

822
00:50:06,148 --> 00:50:07,714
that we plan on
having him return

823
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:10,483
and simply wishes to earn
whatever interest they can

824
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:13,019
on the full amount
for the next three months.

825
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:15,821
<i>Couldn't you spare</i>
<i>that interest</i>

826
00:50:15,823 --> 00:50:18,624
<i>in exchange</i>
<i>for my peace of mind?</i>

827
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,165
<i>Lane, darling?</i>

828
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:29,035
What? I'm sorry.
I didn't get that last bit.

829
00:50:29,037 --> 00:50:31,371
Nothing.
Don't forget

830
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:33,573
to get the name of
Megan's real estate agent.

831
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:34,975
Yes, dear.

832
00:50:34,977 --> 00:50:37,244
<i>And her decorator.</i>

833
00:50:44,452 --> 00:50:47,320
Oh, Apolo,
you're so good with him.

834
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:50,423
Oh, I wasn't expecting
you back so soon.

835
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:53,159
First in line
at the post office.

836
00:50:53,161 --> 00:50:55,861
- It wasn't that bad.
- Hello, Miss Joan.

837
00:50:55,863 --> 00:50:57,696
Sink is draining.

838
00:50:57,698 --> 00:51:00,531
Turns out it was a lemon peel.

839
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,333
I'm sure you know
we're appreciative,

840
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:04,568
but mother and I
have so much to do.

841
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,671
I am busy, busy, too.

842
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:08,239
Oh, you don't have to rush off.

843
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:10,675
He doesn't have to
rush off, does he?

844
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,279
When you need Apolo,
you call Apolo.

845
00:51:19,852 --> 00:51:21,018
I want him to hear--

846
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,854
That was just rude.

847
00:51:22,856 --> 00:51:25,390
It is one thing
to have him work here,

848
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:28,459
it is another thing to give
him cake and my baby.

849
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:32,263
His fingers have been in every
toilet from here to the bowery.

850
00:51:32,265 --> 00:51:34,599
He brought the cookies.

851
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:37,936
If you want to go on
a date with him, just ask.

852
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:40,305
He's married
with four children.

853
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:43,108
I'm just making sure this
apartment gets his attention.

854
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:46,678
This apartment has never had any
trouble getting his attention.

855
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,381
Yes, Joanie.
Everyone's staring at you.

856
00:51:49,383 --> 00:51:51,850
You know you're not exactly
at your fighting weight.

857
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:53,852
Try me.

858
00:51:53,854 --> 00:51:55,821
You asked me to come out here.

859
00:51:55,823 --> 00:51:58,290
You can go home
any time you want.

860
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,492
You should think
before you say that.

861
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:02,929
I got my money's worth.

862
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:05,898
Well, I wasn't going
to show you this.

863
00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:18,311
That doesn't make any sense.

864
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:22,215
Look, I'm sure it's not the way
anyone wants you to find out.

865
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:24,083
No, it's not in the want ads.

866
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:26,553
And, honestly, they don't have
the money for more people.

867
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:28,989
It's not more people.
It's you.

868
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:31,859
You love stirring the shit.

869
00:52:31,861 --> 00:52:36,431
I am telling you something
you don't want to hear.

870
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,167
And you are making this
very painful for me.

871
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:41,970
Megan Draper just invited
me to her party.

872
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:43,438
At the very last minute.

873
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,707
Don't tell me that
girl's not conniving.

874
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:48,376
You think she wants you
around her husband?

875
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:53,482
I'm going to lie down.

876
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:56,686
Sometimes life makes
decisions for you.

877
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,500
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

878
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:20,877
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>- I know your birthday was last week,</i>

879
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:23,213
and I was told you don't celebrate
it and not to bring it up.

880
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:25,348
Now I feel like I got
caught with my pants down,

881
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:28,118
so I got you
a little something.

882
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,619
It's a plant.

883
00:53:29,621 --> 00:53:32,856
I just wanted to say
Happy Birthday.

884
00:53:32,858 --> 00:53:34,959
Kiss-ass.

885
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,694
Thank you.

886
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:50,873
I can get you some coffee, but
there's a partners' meeting.

887
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:54,642
- Nobody's there.
- It's in Mr. Campbell's office.

888
00:53:54,644 --> 00:53:57,478
- You want to smile?
- Is it your obituary?

889
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,015
No, it's the little salt
we rubbed in Y&R's wound.

890
00:54:04,352 --> 00:54:06,319
It's beautiful, no?

891
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:09,022
- That's Mr. Campbell.
- Shall we?

892
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:15,629
- Roger.
- What?

893
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,733
We don't make fun of each
other's wives here. Understood?

894
00:54:18,735 --> 00:54:21,035
Come on, I
wasn't making fun of her.

895
00:54:21,037 --> 00:54:23,405
I was making fun of you.
You're happy.

896
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:25,307
- I am.
- Well, I want you to be happy.

897
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:27,609
Somebody should be.

898
00:54:29,211 --> 00:54:31,479
You know, two weeks ago,

899
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:34,115
Jane asked me,
"Which one's Mussolini?"

900
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:38,220
No, it's good.
She's a great girl.

901
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:41,923
They're all great girls.
At least until they want something.

902
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,728
Let's go.

903
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,663
They're just leaving now.

904
00:54:47,665 --> 00:54:50,400
What, did they stop
for a drink?

905
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:53,803
Well, why don't you get off your rear,
find them, and tell them I'm about--

906
00:54:53,805 --> 00:54:55,505
They're here.

907
00:54:58,209 --> 00:55:00,644
Gentlemen, if you
could slide over a bit.

908
00:55:00,646 --> 00:55:02,646
- A marvelous fete.
- Oh, yes.

909
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:04,948
I have instructions from
Trudy to thank both of you.

910
00:55:07,418 --> 00:55:09,553
- Why are we meeting in here?
- Why are we here?

911
00:55:09,555 --> 00:55:12,555
Please don't smoke in here.
I spent the morning choking on the train.

912
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:22,998
So, Mohawk is coming in.
I've brought them in.

913
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,599
- What do you know about that?
- That's great news.

914
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:27,169
- When?
- I don't know.

915
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:29,704
All I was thinking is that I
bring Henry and Jack in here

916
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:32,841
to this very gathering of individuals,
but I have one question.

917
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:35,710
Where are they going to sit?

918
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:39,247
I mean, what kind of impression
does this space give you?

919
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:41,249
Do you gaze upon the cement
column and think,

920
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:44,820
"Yes, I believe success
for me and my company dwells here."

921
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:47,256
Why don't you take
them to the conference room?

922
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:49,491
Because it's not that meeting.

923
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:51,126
Fine, we'll have it
in my office.

924
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:53,495
This does not
involve you, Roger.

925
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:57,032
Nor does Vicks, Playtex,
Life Cereal, Samsonite,

926
00:55:57,034 --> 00:55:59,335
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.

927
00:55:59,337 --> 00:56:02,304
Need I go on?

928
00:56:02,306 --> 00:56:04,239
What are you suggesting?

929
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:07,376
He's suggesting that you
give him your office.

930
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:09,345
No, he's not.

931
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:11,313
- Yes, I am.
- Well, forget it.

932
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:13,750
Where am I supposed
to conduct business?

933
00:56:13,752 --> 00:56:15,552
In the crapper for all I care.

934
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:17,053
I'm a full partner
and you're a junior.

935
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:19,456
So sorry, Charlie,
but them's the breaks.

936
00:56:21,225 --> 00:56:24,394
Gentlemen, I'm sure we can find
an equitable solution to this.

937
00:56:24,396 --> 00:56:26,062
- There's no need for a row.
- You're right.

938
00:56:26,064 --> 00:56:28,231
I say we put it to a vote.

939
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:30,132
I say we step outside.

940
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,942
I didn't think so.

941
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:45,881
Good work on Mohawk.

942
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:47,683
Thank you, but I'm dead
serious about this.

943
00:56:47,685 --> 00:56:50,920
I have too much responsibility
and too much business

944
00:56:50,922 --> 00:56:53,522
to apply my skills
in this environment.

945
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:57,592
You all know it.

946
00:56:57,594 --> 00:56:59,094
We'll buy more space.

947
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:01,863
- If we're handing out offices...
- Absolutely not.

948
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:04,566
I can't extend our
credit line any further.

949
00:57:04,568 --> 00:57:07,235
It'll work itself out.

950
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:11,005
Congratulations.

951
00:57:13,142 --> 00:57:15,510
When are they coming in?

952
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:17,445
I'm still not sure they should,

953
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:19,680
considering the situation.

954
00:57:29,158 --> 00:57:31,258
Great party, Don.

955
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,561
Absolutely.

956
00:57:33,563 --> 00:57:35,496
I couldn't sleep.

957
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:38,566
Oh, those tits and that mouth.

958
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:40,501
She's such a sex kitten.

959
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:43,337
That whole dance--
How did he just sit there?

960
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:46,907
You can't stand up once
you get in that condition.

961
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:48,710
I would have.
I would just stood up

962
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:50,311
and grabbed her little
French behind

963
00:57:50,313 --> 00:57:52,580
and pushed her through those
cheap post four walls.

964
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:54,349
- Hi, Megan.
- Very funny.

965
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:55,851
God, what I would do to her.

966
00:57:55,853 --> 00:57:57,586
Like what, for example?

967
00:57:57,588 --> 00:57:59,321
I'll tell you what.

968
00:57:59,323 --> 00:58:01,424
I would love to see
those heels on my shoulder.

969
00:58:01,426 --> 00:58:04,227
Ooh, <i>je voudrais mas</i> Harry.

970
00:58:04,229 --> 00:58:06,629
Good morning.

971
00:58:06,631 --> 00:58:09,666
Great party.
Thrilled to be included.

972
00:58:09,668 --> 00:58:11,568
Jennifer was very jealous.

973
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,073
I think I'm gonna die.

974
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:18,975
- Oh!
- You could have warned me!

975
00:58:18,977 --> 00:58:20,944
I did!

976
00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:32,243
I have the owner of the wallet
<i>returning your call.</i>

977
00:58:32,245 --> 00:58:34,612
Thank you.

978
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:37,449
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Mr. Pryce.</i>

979
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:39,450
<i>I'm calling for Alex Polito.</i>

980
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:42,921
- And who is this?
- <i>This is his girl Delores.</i>

981
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:44,990
Oh.

982
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:48,594
Well, when he comes
into the office,

983
00:58:48,596 --> 00:58:51,263
I think I should speak
with him personally.

984
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:53,565
Oh, I'm not his secretary.
<i>I'm his girl.</i>

985
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,468
<i>I'm like his wife,</i>
<i>but I can't call myself that.</i>

986
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,670
Oh.

987
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:02,307
You don't sound
happy about that.

988
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:05,109
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>- I'm married myself.</i>

989
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:07,145
<i>Oh, good for you.</i>
<i>What's her name?</i>

990
00:59:07,147 --> 00:59:09,213
Rebecca.
Rebecca Pryce.

991
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:11,449
Well, obviously.

992
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:14,086
- <i>That's a pretty name.</i>
<i>- I suppose so.</i>

993
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:17,390
She enjoys it.

994
00:59:17,392 --> 00:59:19,625
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>she's home right now,</i>

995
00:59:19,627 --> 00:59:21,861
<i>lying in bed,</i>
<i>talking to a stranger?</i>

996
00:59:21,863 --> 00:59:25,165
Oh, I should hope not.

997
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:28,002
<i>So-- so you have</i>
<i>Alex's wallet?</i>

998
00:59:28,004 --> 00:59:30,738
Yes, I do.

999
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,072
<i>And where are you?</i>

1000
00:59:32,074 --> 00:59:34,174
I'm at my offices in midtown.

1001
00:59:34,176 --> 00:59:36,910
<i>Oh, are you in big business?</i>

1002
00:59:36,912 --> 00:59:39,046
Excuse me?

1003
00:59:39,048 --> 00:59:41,248
<i>Are you in a big</i>
<i>office building?</i>

1004
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:44,217
Uh, yes.

1005
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:48,187
That's why I don't
have the luxury

1006
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:51,457
of lying around at 11:00
in my underthings.

1007
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:54,227
<i>I didn't tell you that part.</i>

1008
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:58,065
You didn't say
I was incorrect, either.

1009
00:59:58,067 --> 01:00:00,301
<i>Where the hell are you from?</i>

1010
01:00:00,303 --> 01:00:02,537
You sound like Cary Grant.

1011
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:05,339
I told you, midtown.

1012
01:00:05,341 --> 01:00:07,708
Why don't I--

1013
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:12,113
Listen, I really
should return this--

1014
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:13,615
You know, the wallet.

1015
01:00:13,617 --> 01:00:16,151
I could slip it
in the post or...

1016
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:18,753
Of course, you know,
that has its disadvantages.

1017
01:00:18,755 --> 01:00:21,189
There's a bit of cash here.

1018
01:00:21,191 --> 01:00:24,059
Or I could
hand-deliver it.

1019
01:00:24,061 --> 01:00:26,729
Is this a current address?

1020
01:00:32,268 --> 01:00:34,002
<i>I don't know.</i>

1021
01:00:34,004 --> 01:00:36,638
<i>I don't know if that</i>
<i>would be proper.</i>

1022
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:41,143
No, of course.

1023
01:00:41,145 --> 01:00:44,079
Why don't you meet me
at my place of business?

1024
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:47,883
I'll give you the address
or have my secretary help you.

1025
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:52,288
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Why don't we do that?</i>

1026
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,123
<i>And I'll come by when I can.</i>

1027
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:57,627
Well, I'll be here
the rest of my life.

1028
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,897
Uh, just a minute.

1029
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:07,269
I look forward to it.

1030
01:01:07,271 --> 01:01:09,137
<i>Why not?</i>

1031
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:10,605
Toodle-loo.

1032
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:12,874
<i>That's cute.</i>

1033
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:18,614
Scarlett, would you give this
woman directions to our office?

1034
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:20,582
She's on line three.

1035
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,007
<i>Mr. Crane.</i>

1036
01:01:44,009 --> 01:01:45,676
Mr. Sterling has requested
<i>you in his office.</i>

1037
01:01:45,678 --> 01:01:48,712
- Is there a meeting?
- <i>He just--</i>

1038
01:01:48,714 --> 01:01:51,582
<i>He just came over here,</i>
<i>said he needed to see you</i>

1039
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,484
<i>and walked away.</i>

1040
01:01:53,486 --> 01:01:55,853
- Why didn't he come in?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

1041
01:01:55,855 --> 01:01:58,022
He knows you're in there.

1042
01:01:58,024 --> 01:02:01,659
Okay. Okay. Did you see him
talking to Megan or Don?

1043
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:03,995
<i>I've been working.</i>
<i>What did you do?</i>

1044
01:02:03,997 --> 01:02:06,230
Nothing!

1045
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:21,247
You wanted to see me?

1046
01:02:21,249 --> 01:02:22,716
I did.

1047
01:02:22,718 --> 01:02:24,517
Come in, have a seat.

1048
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:26,620
No, that's okay.

1049
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:28,756
I think you should have a seat.

1050
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:32,292
Okay.

1051
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:37,564
Now, I think you know

1052
01:02:37,566 --> 01:02:40,468
that we like to think
of this place as a family.

1053
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,704
And there are certain ways
a family behaves.

1054
01:02:43,706 --> 01:02:46,140
What did she say?
You have to hear my side of it.

1055
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:48,876
Your side of what?

1056
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:50,812
What-- Nothing.

1057
01:02:50,814 --> 01:02:53,849
You're always up to something,
aren't you, Crane?

1058
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:56,785
It was an honest mistake and I
consider myself reprimanded.

1059
01:02:56,787 --> 01:02:58,387
Great.

1060
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:01,290
I was thinking Pete
could take your office.

1061
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:03,192
Really?

1062
01:03:03,194 --> 01:03:05,462
Look, I will apologize
face to face,

1063
01:03:05,464 --> 01:03:07,297
as horrible as that will
be, but I think you're--

1064
01:03:07,299 --> 01:03:10,134
There's no reason to let me go.

1065
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,204
You're not getting fired.

1066
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:17,240
- Oh.
- And what the hell did you do?

1067
01:03:17,242 --> 01:03:19,376
I made fun of
"Zou Bisou."

1068
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,545
So did I.

1069
01:03:22,547 --> 01:03:24,213
Is that a crime?
No.

1070
01:03:24,215 --> 01:03:27,049
I tried to get Jane to
talk to me in that accent.

1071
01:03:27,051 --> 01:03:30,352
Nothing doing. She doesn't speak French.
She doesn't like me.

1072
01:03:30,354 --> 01:03:33,689
I went home after and Jennifer
didn't know what was coming.

1073
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:35,691
- I was like--
- I don't want to hear that.

1074
01:03:35,693 --> 01:03:37,793
No, of course you don't.
Why would you?

1075
01:03:37,795 --> 01:03:42,131
Look, I think you can understand
that Pete needs a bigger office.

1076
01:03:42,133 --> 01:03:44,534
And just between you,
me, and the window washer,

1077
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:47,804
it's been decided
that you should trade.

1078
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:50,407
Who decided that?

1079
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,910
- I did.
- I can't do that.

1080
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:57,980
And I don't know that I
have to do it. Do I?

1081
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:03,619
Harry...

1082
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:06,622
I'm asking you as a friend.

1083
01:04:06,624 --> 01:04:10,092
And I appreciate that, Roger, I
really do, but I need my office.

1084
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:12,794
Look, first of all, Pete's
office isn't that different.

1085
01:04:12,796 --> 01:04:14,930
- I disagree.
- Fine.

1086
01:04:14,932 --> 01:04:18,166
Name the most important person you
could bring into this office.

1087
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:21,970
William Paley.

1088
01:04:21,972 --> 01:04:24,406
Okay, so you shouldn't do that.

1089
01:04:24,408 --> 01:04:26,808
Trust me, network and
studio executives

1090
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:28,476
want to think you're
out there jet-setting,

1091
01:04:28,478 --> 01:04:30,312
rubbing shoulders
with television stars

1092
01:04:30,314 --> 01:04:32,381
and chorus girls.

1093
01:04:32,383 --> 01:04:34,316
You should be talking
to clients ringside

1094
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:36,853
or at a three-star
restaurant,

1095
01:04:36,855 --> 01:04:39,155
not coming into your
miserable little office.

1096
01:04:39,157 --> 01:04:41,458
But I do.
I come in here almost every day.

1097
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,827
And Pete's office is a shit
hole with a support beam.

1098
01:04:45,797 --> 01:04:48,532
What if I were to
make it worth your while?

1099
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:50,267
I'm already head
of my department.

1100
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:52,769
What would be
an appropriate bonus?

1101
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:55,038
There's no bonuses.
We have no money.

1102
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,906
How much would it take?

1103
01:04:56,908 --> 01:04:59,075
Well, first of all, it's more
than you could have on you.

1104
01:04:59,077 --> 01:05:00,976
Really?

1105
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,015
That's $1,100.

1106
01:05:06,017 --> 01:05:07,783
Why do you carry so much cash?

1107
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:09,985
It's more than 1,000, Harry.

1108
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:16,526
That is a month's salary

1109
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:18,661
after taxes.

1110
01:05:22,234 --> 01:05:23,968
There's no window in there.

1111
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:25,870
You could buy yourself
a very beautiful picture

1112
01:05:25,872 --> 01:05:27,872
of something to look at.

1113
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:33,778
Well, okay.

1114
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,747
- But you're gonna owe me.
- No, I'm not.

1115
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:38,049
I just gave you a lot of money.

1116
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:40,651
This is a transaction.
And if you don't like it,

1117
01:05:40,653 --> 01:05:43,921
we can have the conversation
you thought we were having.

1118
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:45,989
So this is every month?

1119
01:05:45,991 --> 01:05:48,224
Get the hell out of my office.

1120
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:18,523
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

1121
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:20,024
I'm Joan.

1122
01:06:20,026 --> 01:06:23,261
I'm Meredith.
Can I help you?

1123
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:25,396
Joan Harris.

1124
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:28,032
I work here.

1125
01:06:28,034 --> 01:06:30,134
Worked here.
I've been on leave.

1126
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,238
Oh, Joan.

1127
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,906
My goodness.

1128
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,776
It's hard to believe
you just had a baby.

1129
01:06:38,778 --> 01:06:41,246
You don't know where I started.

1130
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:42,714
Do you want me to announce you?

1131
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:44,316
No, I'll let myself in.

1132
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:47,486
- Are you sure?
- No one mentioned a new girl.

1133
01:06:47,488 --> 01:06:49,788
I guess they needed
someone up here

1134
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:52,291
because Scarlett is now
covering Mr. Pryce,

1135
01:06:52,293 --> 01:06:55,327
so that she can
do the books with Clara.

1136
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:59,865
Well, now I can understand
why I wasn't told.

1137
01:06:59,867 --> 01:07:02,568
Oh, my God.
My mouth.

1138
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:05,271
Could you just
help me with the door?

1139
01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:09,375
Oh, he's adorable.

1140
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:13,646
Please don't be mad at me
for telling you that.

1141
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:16,316
I'm very happy
being nobody here.

1142
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,386
I know a girl who had your job
who ended up with everything.

1143
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,591
Where would you like
to visit first?

1144
01:07:25,593 --> 01:07:27,360
I suppose my office.

1145
01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:29,729
Yes, yes, absolutely.
Joan.

1146
01:07:29,731 --> 01:07:32,698
My goodness, you look radiant.

1147
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,236
- Can I see him?
- I don't see why not.

1148
01:07:36,238 --> 01:07:38,871
- Where's Scarlett?
- Go fetch Caroline.

1149
01:07:40,274 --> 01:07:42,475
Joanie.

1150
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:45,078
Look at you out and about.

1151
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,913
Yes, we're gonna stop
by the Copa later.

1152
01:07:46,915 --> 01:07:48,649
One of us badly needs a drink.

1153
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:52,620
Lane made it very clear
we're not hiring anybody.

1154
01:07:52,622 --> 01:07:55,422
I don't care how buxom
his mother is.

1155
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:57,157
Oh, Don.

1156
01:07:57,159 --> 01:08:00,527
- Look at that.
- He's okay.

1157
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:07,967
Hello, Megan.

1158
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:10,236
Oh, hello, Joan.

1159
01:08:14,574 --> 01:08:17,009
I'm sure I'm not ruining
any surprises at this point,

1160
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:19,245
but how was your party?
I'm sorry I missed it.

1161
01:08:19,247 --> 01:08:22,549
Oh, he's adorable.

1162
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:23,950
Are we welcoming you back?

1163
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:25,986
- That was my impression.
- Today?

1164
01:08:25,988 --> 01:08:28,422
- Do you want to hold him?
- What?

1165
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:36,965
He's a little cabbage.

1166
01:08:36,967 --> 01:08:39,334
<i>Mon petit chou.</i>

1167
01:08:39,336 --> 01:08:43,004
It's just a matter
of time, Don.

1168
01:08:43,006 --> 01:08:45,307
I should be getting
back to work.

1169
01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:51,314
I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.

1170
01:08:51,316 --> 01:08:53,116
Joanie, I'll say what I
said when you left here--

1171
01:08:53,118 --> 01:08:54,918
This is not a good excuse.

1172
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,088
Nice to see you.

1173
01:08:57,090 --> 01:09:00,124
- When are you coming back?
- I was planning on three weeks.

1174
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:02,460
My mother's leaving any day,
so I was gonna hire a girl.

1175
01:09:02,462 --> 01:09:05,697
It's gonna be
terrible to leave him.

1176
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:08,767
Joan.

1177
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:11,003
I was wondering if you
were going to visit.

1178
01:09:13,307 --> 01:09:15,307
Oh, my hands are dirty.

1179
01:09:15,309 --> 01:09:17,409
Oh, my God.
He looks just like you.

1180
01:09:17,411 --> 01:09:20,879
I should get back to work.
I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.

1181
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:22,547
Good.

1182
01:09:25,417 --> 01:09:27,351
So, how are you?

1183
01:09:27,353 --> 01:09:29,352
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

1184
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:31,321
There's my baby.

1185
01:09:31,323 --> 01:09:34,057
Now move that brat out
of the way so I can see her.

1186
01:09:34,059 --> 01:09:35,860
Hello, Roger.

1187
01:09:35,862 --> 01:09:37,662
Little dud like my present?

1188
01:09:37,664 --> 01:09:39,363
I'm sure you're aware

1189
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:41,632
that a bicycle's not
useful yet, Uncle Roger.

1190
01:09:41,634 --> 01:09:43,201
Oh, no?
He's a loafer?

1191
01:09:43,203 --> 01:09:45,570
He's been keeping me awake.

1192
01:09:45,572 --> 01:09:47,506
He needs constant attention.

1193
01:09:47,508 --> 01:09:50,309
Is that right?
Let me see that.

1194
01:09:55,849 --> 01:09:58,818
Has anyone even seen this baby
with you walking next to him?

1195
01:10:00,221 --> 01:10:02,421
<i>Scarlett.</i>
<i>Scarlett, may I see you?</i>

1196
01:10:02,423 --> 01:10:04,056
I got it.

1197
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:07,826
Mr. Pryce,

1198
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,627
Mrs. Harris is here
to see you.

1199
01:10:09,629 --> 01:10:13,097
- <i>Oh, send her in.</i>
<i>- I've got him.</i>

1200
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:16,534
Caroline, I need you to make
dinner reservations right away.

1201
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:20,204
I'll be right back.

1202
01:10:25,678 --> 01:10:27,946
This really is
an unexpected pleasure.

1203
01:10:27,948 --> 01:10:29,782
Just stopping by.

1204
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:33,252
Anything I should know about?

1205
01:10:33,254 --> 01:10:36,722
Uh, yes, actually.
Pressing business.

1206
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,193
Would you mind?

1207
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,962
No, not at all.

1208
01:10:48,902 --> 01:10:51,937
What are we supposed
to do with him?

1209
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:53,905
Better than the steps
of a church, I guess.

1210
01:10:56,675 --> 01:10:58,209
Have either of you seen Clara?

1211
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:00,612
No.

1212
01:11:00,614 --> 01:11:02,180
What's that?

1213
01:11:02,182 --> 01:11:04,382
Oh, it's Joan's little boy.

1214
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:10,053
Oh, that's darling.

1215
01:11:10,055 --> 01:11:12,923
Would you please take him
and give him back to Joan?

1216
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:15,926
Do I suddenly appear
to be wearing a skirt?

1217
01:11:15,928 --> 01:11:19,030
Spectacular party.

1218
01:11:19,032 --> 01:11:21,300
Just take him.
You should say hello to Joan anyways.

1219
01:11:29,276 --> 01:11:31,511
Clara?

1220
01:11:31,513 --> 01:11:33,279
She looks very good.

1221
01:11:33,281 --> 01:11:36,148
She does.
She looked good at nine months.

1222
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:38,217
I don't know about that.

1223
01:11:40,553 --> 01:11:42,153
I'm surprised
you didn't tell her.

1224
01:11:42,155 --> 01:11:44,922
- Tell her what?
- That she looked terrible.

1225
01:11:44,924 --> 01:11:48,125
You seem to say
whatever's on your mind.

1226
01:11:48,127 --> 01:11:50,094
Is something wrong?

1227
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:52,830
No.

1228
01:11:52,832 --> 01:11:56,033
I got the vicks coupons done.

1229
01:11:56,035 --> 01:11:59,204
I know you thought you were the
only one working this weekend.

1230
01:11:59,206 --> 01:12:01,806
No, I didn't.

1231
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:05,043
Really?
That's what you said to Don.

1232
01:12:06,346 --> 01:12:08,547
I know.

1233
01:12:08,549 --> 01:12:11,083
I just-- I had too
much to drink and--

1234
01:12:11,085 --> 01:12:13,486
And you couldn't resist
saying something obnoxious?

1235
01:12:13,488 --> 01:12:15,788
Well, just so we're clear,

1236
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,457
I put in a lot of work on Heinz.
So did you.

1237
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,659
You can't even apologize.
None of you can.

1238
01:12:23,595 --> 01:12:27,264
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

1239
01:12:27,266 --> 01:12:29,466
What is wrong with you people?

1240
01:12:29,468 --> 01:12:32,202
You're all so cynical.
You don't smile.

1241
01:12:32,204 --> 01:12:34,604
- You smirk.
- Is he mad at me?

1242
01:12:34,606 --> 01:12:36,873
I don't care.

1243
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:39,008
Who wouldn't want
a surprise party?

1244
01:12:42,546 --> 01:12:44,313
I don't feel well.

1245
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:50,718
- Megan...
- No, really, I don't-- I don't feel well.

1246
01:12:54,824 --> 01:12:57,458
Am I allowed to go home?

1247
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,527
Of course.

1248
01:13:01,997 --> 01:13:04,532
I'm so sorry.
You were right.

1249
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:06,634
I apologize.

1250
01:13:08,203 --> 01:13:10,437
It's fine.

1251
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:23,413
Heinz won't
sign off on the work.

1252
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:25,615
So they won't be back in
for 30 days,

1253
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:28,051
which means we won't get
paid for another 90.

1254
01:13:28,053 --> 01:13:29,887
And we're about
to shoot Christmas ads

1255
01:13:29,889 --> 01:13:31,756
for Sugarberry and Vicks.

1256
01:13:31,758 --> 01:13:33,758
But they won't run
until Christmas,

1257
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,060
so we won't get paid
until easter.

1258
01:13:36,062 --> 01:13:39,696
Well, that explains why you're
asking me for all this free advice.

1259
01:13:39,698 --> 01:13:42,298
Oh, I'm just trying
to get things in order.

1260
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,333
So that you can
eliminate my job?

1261
01:13:44,335 --> 01:13:46,235
What?
Absolutely not.

1262
01:13:46,237 --> 01:13:49,205
- Then why did you run an ad?
- What ad?

1263
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:52,175
- In this morning's Times.
- <i>Oh, that.</i>

1264
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,377
That wasn't an ad.

1265
01:13:54,379 --> 01:13:56,613
Well, what the hell
was it, then?

1266
01:13:56,615 --> 01:14:00,183
It was some private
Barb directed at Y&R.

1267
01:14:03,687 --> 01:14:06,623
Mrs. Harris, the books
have practically

1268
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:09,527
been held together
with spit in your absence.

1269
01:14:11,263 --> 01:14:14,198
What about Scarlett and Clara
splitting my work?

1270
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,333
Splitting?
The two of them together

1271
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:19,303
couldn't operate a parking meter.
They're imbeciles.

1272
01:14:22,273 --> 01:14:25,341
Well, that was
a dumb thing to do.

1273
01:14:25,343 --> 01:14:28,044
Oh, there, there.

1274
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,250
I'm sorry.

1275
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:37,187
I've been like this
since the baby.

1276
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:39,123
And it's not him.

1277
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:41,859
I just...

1278
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:44,929
Keep thinking about
what's going on here

1279
01:14:44,931 --> 01:14:47,199
and I missed it too much.

1280
01:14:47,201 --> 01:14:48,801
It's too embarrassing.

1281
01:14:48,803 --> 01:14:50,870
Nothing's happened.

1282
01:14:50,872 --> 01:14:53,573
Something always happens.
Things are different.

1283
01:14:53,575 --> 01:14:57,277
Somebody tells a joke and you don't
know what they're talking about.

1284
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:01,314
There have been no jokes,
not without you.

1285
01:15:01,316 --> 01:15:03,349
Not even at my expense?

1286
01:15:03,351 --> 01:15:06,285
I'm terribly
adrift without you.

1287
01:15:06,287 --> 01:15:09,355
It's just a matter of time
before they find out I'm a sham.

1288
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:14,694
Nobody came to visit me.

1289
01:15:14,696 --> 01:15:17,463
They sent flowers
with some stupid card

1290
01:15:17,465 --> 01:15:20,666
written by the florist.

1291
01:15:20,668 --> 01:15:23,669
There would have been a cake, but
you weren't here to arrange it.

1292
01:15:27,473 --> 01:15:29,707
It's just--

1293
01:15:31,243 --> 01:15:33,778
And I don't expect you
to understand this--

1294
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,582
but my husband's
been gone so long.

1295
01:15:38,584 --> 01:15:40,685
And I know he's coming
home soon.

1296
01:15:43,855 --> 01:15:46,089
And even with my baby
there and my mother...

1297
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:50,326
I feel alone.

1298
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:54,063
It's home, but
it's not everything.

1299
01:15:55,533 --> 01:15:57,434
I do understand.

1300
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:04,608
Now, I won't have everyone
thinking I've made you cry.

1301
01:16:10,716 --> 01:16:12,750
Well, at least tell me
about the party.

1302
01:16:12,752 --> 01:16:15,119
Mrs. Draper put on
a bit of a burlesque.

1303
01:16:15,121 --> 01:16:17,287
- No.
- Oh, yes.

1304
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:20,390
She danced and sang
in front of all of us.

1305
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:23,459
She was quite the kickette.

1306
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:32,301
I can't do it justice.

1307
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:34,637
And Don?

1308
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:38,341
I saw his soul leave his body.

1309
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,476
I can't even imagine

1310
01:16:40,478 --> 01:16:43,247
how handsome that man
must be blushing.

1311
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:45,549
Yes.

1312
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,328
I don't know how I ended
up with him, but...

1313
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:59,797
Thank you so much.

1314
01:17:03,801 --> 01:17:06,535
Mr. Pryce, I will
be speaking with you.

1315
01:17:06,537 --> 01:17:08,537
Let me take a look
at him at least.

1316
01:17:15,312 --> 01:17:17,313
Handsome little blackheart.

1317
01:17:19,985 --> 01:17:21,718
Ah!

1318
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,422
Oops.
I think...

1319
01:17:25,424 --> 01:17:27,424
Have you seen Clara?

1320
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:30,626
<i>Congratulations.
We're gonna be right next to each other finally.</i>

1321
01:17:30,628 --> 01:17:32,995
What's going on?

1322
01:17:32,997 --> 01:17:34,830
Clara, could you excuse us?

1323
01:17:34,832 --> 01:17:36,466
Well, she obviously
already knows.

1324
01:17:36,468 --> 01:17:38,201
Please.

1325
01:17:40,104 --> 01:17:42,439
Uh, Roger, you know,
convinced me.

1326
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:45,542
We all thought it was best for the
firm that you have a bigger office,

1327
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:48,145
so I was asked to switch.

1328
01:17:48,147 --> 01:17:50,113
I'll be right back.

1329
01:17:53,951 --> 01:17:55,718
I appreciate your sacrifice,

1330
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,621
but a bigger office
was not the point.

1331
01:17:57,623 --> 01:17:59,356
Well, fine, then.
I'll switch back.

1332
01:17:59,358 --> 01:18:01,926
Roger didn't say
I couldn't switch back.

1333
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:04,261
I don't care what Roger says.
I am the head of accounts.

1334
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,030
I am bringing in all the business.
I deserve the bigger office.

1335
01:18:07,032 --> 01:18:09,532
It's a great office, Pete.

1336
01:18:09,534 --> 01:18:11,668
It's very important.

1337
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:14,638
It's got the windows.
God, I'm gonna miss them.

1338
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,140
And you did this because
Roger told you to?

1339
01:18:17,142 --> 01:18:19,243
And also because
I respect you so much.

1340
01:18:19,245 --> 01:18:20,978
What do you want me to say?

1341
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,447
Look, I just need a place
to hide until Megan leaves.

1342
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:27,185
Oh, God, unless she told Don.

1343
01:18:27,187 --> 01:18:29,254
She's not gonna
tell Don, is she?

1344
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,991
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1345
01:18:35,793 --> 01:18:38,328
<i>Come in.</i>

1346
01:18:45,969 --> 01:18:47,836
What's up?

1347
01:18:49,772 --> 01:18:53,174
At your party,
which was lovely,

1348
01:18:53,176 --> 01:18:55,376
I said something which
I shouldn't have said.

1349
01:18:55,378 --> 01:18:58,178
And I want to apologize

1350
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,214
if you had a bad
time because of it.

1351
01:19:00,216 --> 01:19:02,049
I had a wonderful time.

1352
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:04,385
Well, good.

1353
01:19:04,387 --> 01:19:06,153
The only reason
I'm bringing it up

1354
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:08,455
is Megan seemed kind of upset.

1355
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:13,994
I'm very sorry.
I should not be allowed

1356
01:19:13,996 --> 01:19:17,165
to drink at work functions.
Or at all, honestly.

1357
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,200
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

1358
01:19:19,202 --> 01:19:22,470
But she went home.
She wasn't feeling well.

1359
01:19:22,472 --> 01:19:25,472
I'm mortified if I had
something to do with it.

1360
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:27,341
When did she leave?

1361
01:19:27,343 --> 01:19:29,176
I think she wants to be alone.

1362
01:19:29,178 --> 01:19:31,311
You don't know her at all.

1363
01:19:32,413 --> 01:19:33,981
Caroline.

1364
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:36,150
I'm done for the day.

1365
01:19:42,219 --> 01:19:44,387
<i>Mr. Pryce.</i>

1366
01:19:50,393 --> 01:19:52,694
- Yes, Scarlett?
- <i>There's a gentleman here,</i>

1367
01:19:52,729 --> 01:19:55,765
<i>the owner of the wallet--</i>
<i>Mr. Polito.</i>

1368
01:19:55,799 --> 01:19:57,866
<i>He's in reception.</i>
<i>Shall I bring him back?</i>

1369
01:19:57,901 --> 01:20:00,369
No, absolutely not.

1370
01:20:00,403 --> 01:20:01,970
<i>Well, do you want to see him?</i>

1371
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:05,374
Yes, I'll be out in a moment.

1372
01:20:05,408 --> 01:20:07,343
<i>Of course, Mr. Pryce.</i>

1373
01:20:07,377 --> 01:20:09,445
Thank you, Delores.

1374
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:12,281
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- I said just a minute.

1375
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:31,167
Hello.

1376
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,003
Are you Mr. Polito?

1377
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:37,574
I am. Although there's no
way for you to know that.

1378
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:39,275
You got my wallet.

1379
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:41,211
I contacted you.

1380
01:20:41,245 --> 01:20:43,647
Thank you.

1381
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:46,016
Well, I'm glad this worked out.

1382
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,417
Hold on.

1383
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:48,918
Just hold on a second.

1384
01:20:54,425 --> 01:20:56,926
Everything's there.

1385
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,603
So it is.

1386
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:12,609
Well, you can't blame me.

1387
01:21:12,644 --> 01:21:15,246
My horse came in
and I lost my wallet.

1388
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,847
Then it came in again.

1389
01:21:18,684 --> 01:21:21,520
- Here.
- No, that's not necessary.

1390
01:21:21,554 --> 01:21:24,623
- You've got to take a reward.
- I couldn't possibly.

1391
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:29,695
My girl said
you were real polite.

1392
01:21:31,898 --> 01:21:34,632
Obviously from the accent,
you're not from around here.

1393
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:37,635
No, I'm not.

1394
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:42,672
This is the way we do things.

1395
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:48,644
Thanks again.
I mean it.

1396
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,913
You're a real gentleman.

1397
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:12,335
Megan?
Where are you?

1398
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:17,509
Oh, you're home.

1399
01:22:17,543 --> 01:22:19,678
So are you.
What happened?

1400
01:22:19,712 --> 01:22:21,146
Nothing.

1401
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,349
You just left without me?

1402
01:22:23,383 --> 01:22:26,452
- I was upset.
- That's clear.

1403
01:22:26,486 --> 01:22:28,120
About what?

1404
01:22:28,155 --> 01:22:30,556
Because my apartment is filthy.

1405
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:33,025
Where's the girl?

1406
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,228
I sent her home.

1407
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,504
What are you doing?

1408
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:49,141
I'm cleaning up.
I don't want to get sweaty.

1409
01:22:49,175 --> 01:22:52,944
- Like that?
- Don't you look at me.

1410
01:22:52,978 --> 01:22:54,846
I'm talking to you.

1411
01:22:56,581 --> 01:22:58,382
I'm cleaning up.

1412
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:00,017
Really?

1413
01:23:00,051 --> 01:23:03,453
Stop looking at me.
You aren't allowed to look at me.

1414
01:23:03,488 --> 01:23:05,122
Then put some clothes on.

1415
01:23:05,156 --> 01:23:08,192
I said stop it.
You don't deserve it.

1416
01:23:08,226 --> 01:23:10,527
Come on.

1417
01:23:10,562 --> 01:23:13,631
You don't like presents.
You don't like nice things.

1418
01:23:22,274 --> 01:23:25,242
Besides, you're too old.

1419
01:23:25,277 --> 01:23:27,411
I don't need an old person.

1420
01:23:27,446 --> 01:23:29,113
You probably couldn't
do it anyway.

1421
01:23:29,147 --> 01:23:31,282
Don't.

1422
01:23:31,316 --> 01:23:32,917
- Get up.
- No.

1423
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:35,152
I don't want people to
think you're getting this.

1424
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:38,823
- You want it so badly.
- I don't want it.

1425
01:23:38,857 --> 01:23:41,092
I don't want you.

1426
01:23:41,126 --> 01:23:43,528
You don't get to have this.
Go sit over there.

1427
01:23:43,562 --> 01:23:45,897
All you get to do is watch.

1428
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:15,157
Where's Harry?

1429
01:24:15,192 --> 01:24:17,927
Who cares?

1430
01:24:17,961 --> 01:24:20,295
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you need to see Mr. Campbell?

1431
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:21,863
No.

1432
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:26,001
Is Roger Sterling still here?

1433
01:24:26,035 --> 01:24:27,703
Yes.

1434
01:24:27,737 --> 01:24:29,972
I want you to let him do
whatever he wants.

1435
01:24:30,006 --> 01:24:32,141
And I want you to pencil in
an appointment tomorrow

1436
01:24:32,175 --> 01:24:35,178
at the coffee shop in the ferry
building in Staten Island.

1437
01:24:35,212 --> 01:24:37,247
6:00 A.M.

1438
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:40,651
With Coca-Cola.

1439
01:24:40,685 --> 01:24:42,853
Okay.

1440
01:24:44,323 --> 01:24:45,890
That'll be all.

1441
01:25:11,214 --> 01:25:13,716
I don't think
those people like me.

1442
01:25:15,352 --> 01:25:17,586
That's not true.

1443
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:21,756
Well, I'm not sure I like them.

1444
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:30,566
The reason I didn't want
you to have that party is

1445
01:25:30,601 --> 01:25:34,104
I didn't want them in our home.

1446
01:25:34,138 --> 01:25:37,040
You've only been in the
creative end of this business

1447
01:25:37,074 --> 01:25:38,675
for three months.

1448
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:42,079
And being a secretary,
you don't know what goes on.

1449
01:25:42,114 --> 01:25:46,117
There isn't one problem that Peggy
or anybody in that office has

1450
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:48,786
that wasn't there before you.

1451
01:25:53,559 --> 01:25:55,860
You think you're a splinter?

1452
01:25:55,894 --> 01:25:57,628
You're not.

1453
01:25:57,662 --> 01:26:00,897
The whole foot's been
infected for years.

1454
01:26:05,469 --> 01:26:07,771
I love going to work with you

1455
01:26:07,805 --> 01:26:12,109
because you love work
and you love me.

1456
01:26:12,143 --> 01:26:15,412
But I wonder if

1457
01:26:15,446 --> 01:26:17,848
maybe it's not a good idea.

1458
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:23,152
I don't really care about work.

1459
01:26:23,187 --> 01:26:25,488
I want you at work

1460
01:26:25,522 --> 01:26:27,757
because I want you.

1461
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:40,835
I think we have to
replace the rug.

1462
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,275
Just because you see white carpet in a
magazine doesn't mean it's practical.

1463
01:26:47,309 --> 01:26:48,977
It's beautiful.

1464
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:52,414
Well, I've taken a lot of
pictures of white carpets.

1465
01:26:52,448 --> 01:26:55,685
You have to have
four or five on hand.

1466
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,889
I thought you wanted it.

1467
01:27:00,725 --> 01:27:03,394
I just wanted you
to have what you want.

1468
01:27:42,535 --> 01:27:44,036
What are you doing?

1469
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:46,171
I've got to go
to Staten Island.

1470
01:27:46,206 --> 01:27:48,774
- What time is it?
- Shut up.

1471
01:27:53,047 --> 01:27:55,081
An aboveground pool?

1472
01:27:55,115 --> 01:27:57,883
No, no, in the ground.
With deck chairs.

1473
01:27:57,918 --> 01:28:00,719
That costs a fortune.
You gonna dig it yourself?

1474
01:28:00,754 --> 01:28:03,222
We'll see what happens
at Christmas.

1475
01:28:03,256 --> 01:28:05,257
I never count on a bonus.

1476
01:28:05,292 --> 01:28:08,093
I'm not talking to you.

1477
01:28:08,128 --> 01:28:10,262
I hope to be dead by Christmas.

1478
01:28:19,074 --> 01:28:21,508
Do you have any money
for the grocer?

1479
01:28:21,543 --> 01:28:23,377
You told me not
to write any checks.

1480
01:28:23,411 --> 01:28:25,479
No, of course.

1481
01:28:36,825 --> 01:28:39,427
Shh.

1482
01:28:44,733 --> 01:28:46,200
Shh.

1483
01:28:46,235 --> 01:28:48,503
He's finally gone to sleep.

1484
01:29:26,776 --> 01:29:29,278
We cannot call security.
They are applicants.

1485
01:29:30,881 --> 01:29:33,048
What's going on out there?

1486
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:36,519
They're all here responding to
your hilarious advertisement.

1487
01:29:36,553 --> 01:29:38,554
Oh.

1488
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,091
Is it just me, or is the
lobby full of negroes?

1489
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:45,794
They saw the Y&R ad.

1490
01:29:45,828 --> 01:29:47,729
The humor was lost on them.

1491
01:29:47,763 --> 01:29:50,632
- Not on me.
- It was a childish prank.

1492
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:52,935
Because you're
above that, right?

1493
01:29:52,969 --> 01:29:54,336
What are we gonna do?

1494
01:29:54,371 --> 01:29:56,072
Would you leave us be, dear?

1495
01:29:57,542 --> 01:29:59,509
Tell them the position's
been filled.

1496
01:29:59,544 --> 01:30:02,813
There's the possibility that we
could be the subject of a protest.

1497
01:30:02,847 --> 01:30:04,949
Then we interview them.
Forever. They'll go away.

1498
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,884
That is not a solution.

1499
01:30:06,918 --> 01:30:09,019
And who's to say there's
not a reporter out there?

1500
01:30:09,054 --> 01:30:10,387
I don't know why
we can't just hire one.

1501
01:30:10,422 --> 01:30:12,856
Because we're not
hiring anyone.

1502
01:30:12,891 --> 01:30:14,158
Just fire that receptionist.

1503
01:30:14,192 --> 01:30:15,893
We can't have one out there.

1504
01:30:21,533 --> 01:30:24,502
- What is that?
- It's from Young & Rubicam.

1505
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:29,007
It's a resume.

1506
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:31,176
"1960 to '65,

1507
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:34,146
toted dat barge,
lifted dat bale."

1508
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:38,151
Did those people out there

1509
01:30:38,185 --> 01:30:41,021
see that artifact come in here?

1510
01:30:41,055 --> 01:30:44,191
Yes.
I'm positive.

1511
01:30:55,069 --> 01:30:56,803
Good morning.

1512
01:30:56,837 --> 01:30:58,938
I'd like to thank
you all for coming.

1513
01:30:58,972 --> 01:31:02,574
First of all, we're only
looking for secretaries.

1514
01:31:02,609 --> 01:31:05,410
So, gentlemen,
you are free to leave.

1515
01:31:05,445 --> 01:31:07,813
I mean, you are
welcome to leave.

1516
01:31:07,847 --> 01:31:11,217
I mean, you may go.

1517
01:31:13,654 --> 01:31:15,722
I will be collecting resumes.

1518
01:31:15,756 --> 01:31:18,525
And then those of you
who meet the qualifications

1519
01:31:18,559 --> 01:31:21,962
will receive a call
to schedule an interview.
