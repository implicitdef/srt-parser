1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,872
Yeah, so we out on Carlton.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,605
This old white motherfucker
and his wife roll up.

3
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,546
He's like, "Young man, you know
where the Poe House is?"

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,642
I'm like, "Unc, you kidding?
Look around, take your pick."

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,687
So, the old man, he's like...

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,523
"The Poe House.
The Edward Allan Poe House."

7
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,661
Shit, you back already?

8
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,061
First of the month, yo.

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,692
I'm like,
"I don't know no Edward Allan Poe."

10
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,330
The man look at me all sad and shit,
like I let him down.

11
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,239
- I know you know you ain't coming in here.
- What?

12
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,142
Shorty, I don't know you.

13
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,841
You know Miss Elaine
in the back room, right?

14
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,578
This her brother, Earl, from the V.A.
Hospital. He's supposed to stay with her.

15
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,978
Can you help me inside? I'm Chantal.

16
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,540
So, what's good?

17
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,547
Thank you, young man.

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,818
Oh, shit.

19
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,790
Oh, shit.

20
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,933
Now, now, now.

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,473
Hey, yo, Omar.

22
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,476
Yo, all due respect, but this right here...

23
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,938
it's a Barksdale joint, man.

24
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,143
Do tell.

25
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,780
You think this boy woke up
yesterday morning...

26
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,649
sat on the edge of his bed and said,
"Today's my day to die"?

27
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,417
You don't think this can happen to you?

28
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,451
Doc, hold that up.

29
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,562
Look at what that bullet did to his heart.

30
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,362
That's his heart.

31
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,532
- What was that, Scared Straight?
- More like bored stiff.

32
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,770
What's the deal with this?

33
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,142
I go down to MCI Jessup, hoping
to pull up a fellow with some years on him.

34
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,806
See if he's ready to share his feelings.

35
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,613
Turns out "Barksdale, D'Angelo"
got himself rung up as a suicide.

36
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,315
- D.O.D. Of 7l21l03.
- Who worked it?

37
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,090
State Police.

38
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,056
You want me to pull the postmortem
on this?

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,957
Yeah, he's kind of a made guy down there.

40
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,327
I just want to make sure
nobody did the suicide to him.

41
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,428
It ain't nothing but dust and bricks
over there now.

42
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,766
Shit, all the battling we did
to take them Towers, man.

43
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,003
You're trying to tell me
we back on the street with the rest of them?

44
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,508
Any way beatin'.

45
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,579
Now that the Towers is gone,
everybody know how it got to go down.

46
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,980
I say we send our people over there early.
Corner chiefs, like, "Yo, we here now...

47
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,814
"you know what I mean,
but we bringing something to the table."

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,253
Lay it out like it's their lucky day.
No flexing, no threats.

49
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,416
Just be like, "This a good thing."

50
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,354
Yeah, but you know,
we gonna need good corners...

51
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,794
that's what we're gonna need.
Close to downtown.

52
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,593
Get the workaday trade.

53
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,964
- Talking about, like, Fremont.
- Fayette.

54
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,937
Yeah, make us like $40,000,
$50,000 a day, easy.

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,098
Yeah, I'm on it.

56
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,505
And, you know,
everybody watching us on this, man.

57
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,704
They wanna see if we're gonna fuck this up
now that the Towers are down.

58
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,781
You know what I'm saying?
They measuring us up.

59
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,112
They wanna see
if we're gonna be weak or real.

60
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,913
If a fool step to us, man,
we gonna do what we got to do.

61
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,318
But it's them bodies that got you in here.

62
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,117
If we can do this without the bodies,
we should.

63
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,285
You know what I mean?
Especially now we light on muscle.

64
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,761
Speaking of muscle, man,
you hear from that man I sent you?

65
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,662
Yeah, Cutty from the cut.
Yeah, he rang, we took care of him.

66
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,859
Good, good.

67
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,895
- How you fixed for the hearing?
- It's all good, man.

68
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,098
Shit.

69
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,304
Levy got everything straightened up
tight for me, man.

70
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,207
I'll be home before it get cold.

71
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,407
Terrace came down.

72
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,941
So?

73
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,042
So, we're coming in.

74
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,621
To my corners? I don't think so.

75
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,783
Hey, hold on now.
This is gonna be good for you, too.

76
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,156
Yeah? Now, how you figure that?

77
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,023
Yo, what you paying now, $37,000, $38,000?

78
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,731
Yo, we can go $31,000, $32,000 shots, man.

79
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,101
The shit's so John Blaze,
you can step on it seven, eight times...

80
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,174
and still take the cake.

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,602
Spider bags. Got those spider bags.

82
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,207
Damn.

83
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,046
Yo, you all seen Marlo?

84
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,055
Y'all ain't seen him?

85
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,286
You all know him?

86
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,020
Marlo?

87
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,557
Yeah, yeah, he was here.

88
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,335
Now he ain't.

89
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,930
Get those spider bags!

90
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,372
Spider bags!

91
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,867
Jesus, Tommy. I'd like to shit.

92
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,613
When I looked up,
saw you on the news, giving it to Erv.

93
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:04,022
- You fucker, you're up to something.
- I'm up to nothing, I'm telling you.

94
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,554
I can help him, he can help me.

95
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,593
A little itch here, a little scratch there.

96
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,187
This is a win-win for you, ain't it?

97
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,335
He won't play? You beat the shit out of him
because crime is up.

98
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,232
Press loves it and you score.

99
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,239
Flip side is that if he caves...

100
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,778
you get yourself a snitch
in the Mayor's inner circle.

101
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,449
So, what's my role in your little drama?

102
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,020
I thought you might broker a meeting.

103
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,453
You know...

104
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,519
help your fearless leader see the light
about his new friend on the Council.

105
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,720
And I should tell him, what?

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,429
Make nice
or invest heavily in petroleum jelly?

107
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,400
Hey, his ass, his choice.

108
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,511
- You didn't talk to him?
- I couldn't find the motherfucker.

109
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,304
Man, we just walk up, we gonna bump.

110
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,423
There. Middle of the block, right there.

111
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,937
Yo, where that whistle at?

112
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,007
Hold on.

113
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,907
Wait for Marlo.

114
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,893
Yo, Cheese. Where you been at, man?

115
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,937
Nigger, that ain't nothing but bait.

116
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,569
Soap your bitch.

117
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,583
Who's my dawg? You my dawg?

118
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,814
Who's my dawg? Who's my baby?

119
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,550
- You make Daddy some money, all right?
- Yeah.

120
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,201
25 large on Dawg!

121
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,698
Cheese!

122
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,266
Yeah.

123
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,548
Anybody I want?

124
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,622
Anybody.

125
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,494
I want more than one.
I want the Olsen twins.

126
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,095
You got them.

127
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,362
Slaves.

128
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,961
All they live for is to get you off.

129
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,267
But, so now, who you gonna do for them?

130
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,809
One guy, one act, one time.

131
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,606
Right. And the minute I name a guy,
you're gonna be like...

132
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,012
"I knew you were a cocksucker
from the first time I laid eyes on you.

133
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,813
"Steve McQueen, huh? That's your fantasy?

134
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,479
"You fucking closet-case motherfucker."

135
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,890
- Steve McQueen?
- Fuck you. It's a set-up.

136
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,520
Both Olsen twins.

137
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,189
Ashley.

138
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,622
- Kate.
- Mary-Kate.

139
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,565
And, yeah, I admire their body of work.

140
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,159
They're yours.

141
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,338
All you got to do is name a guy.

142
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,010
- I'm not catching, I'm pitching.
- No problem.

143
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,713
Corner men out of the pit.

144
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,092
Release your dogs.

145
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,878
Yeah! I got that!

146
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,363
Break your dogs!

147
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,818
Bait.

148
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,692
Oh, shit, there it is.

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:26,131
Can't it just be like
this unbearable-looking woman?

150
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,030
You know, like that old tune from
<i>The Golden Girls?</i>

151
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,405
The short one with the Coke-bottle glasses.

152
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,972
A guy.

153
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,074
- Hey, yo.
- Huh?

154
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,085
Let me ask you a question.

155
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,553
Where do you guys get those hats
with the bills over the ears like that?

156
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,717
I go into all the city stores
and the only ones I can find...

157
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,795
are the ones with the bills in the front.

158
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,331
No, it's the same.
Just turn it sideways on your head.

159
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,860
Thanks. Thank you.

160
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,569
That's a knucklehead from the low-rises,
right there.

161
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,611
The Terrace is spreading out.

162
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,209
Got to go somewheres, I guess.

163
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,116
Don't think you all needed to do that.

164
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,524
He turned cur on me, man.

165
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,752
No.

166
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,460
I think you got played.

167
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,389
So, I'm guessing from the Terrace...

168
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,992
them being all cute about the property line.

169
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,429
I just wanted to wait and see
what you wanted us to do about it.

170
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,156
So, what you want us to do?

171
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,463
Get back to work.

172
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,502
All right.

173
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,114
Your boy really jammed me, that little prick.

174
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,484
It was all over the news.

175
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,790
You did not look
particularly commissioner-like.

176
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,058
The Mayor told me the same thing.

177
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,960
You can't have that shit every week.

178
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,767
Not if you want His Honor to give you
the job permanent.

179
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:47,042
Tommy's a good kid, usually.
An ass pain when he wants something.

180
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,815
- But mostly good people.
- I don't give a shit what he is.

181
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,817
Well, you can't have him
pounding on you, Erv.

182
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,049
Throw him a bone.

183
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,624
He'll take care of you.

184
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,423
All right.

185
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,898
But I draw the line
at going behind the Mayor for this guy.

186
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:12,099
You can't sit where I'm sitting
and backdoor the fucking Mayor.

187
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,001
Sorry I'm late, guys.

188
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,203
The kid had a Little League game.
It started late.

189
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,334
Well, I'll leave you boys to it.

190
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:25,315
And what I have brought together,
let no man tear asunder.

191
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,854
- He win?
- Who?

192
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,718
Your kid, his team.

193
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,788
Shit, who keeps score?

194
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,457
I mean, yes. It's a little hectic, but
everybody stepping off at the right time.

195
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,398
These corner boys we dealing with...

196
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,936
I don't think they even listen
to their own people.

197
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,029
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to peoples.

198
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,604
- Where you at?
- Marlo?

199
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,671
I can't find him.

200
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,045
And you told us not to start nothing.
So I set up in the middle of the block.

201
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,347
You know, even that got hard stares.
I <i>don't...</i>

202
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,617
It ain't gonna hold, I don't think.

203
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,087
Now, this Marlo...

204
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,718
how hard you looking for him?

205
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,187
Like, why ain't you out there
looking for this motherfucker right now?

206
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,924
'Cause you called this meeting here.

207
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,964
Shut the door.

208
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,744
- What's your good news, man?
- Omar right inside the stash.

209
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,979
Couple ounces of raw, already vialed, 600.

210
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,580
Cocksuckers even took my watch.

211
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,522
Second stash this month they done got to.

212
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,255
I mean, he called you by name, String.

213
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,557
I mean, all due respect...

214
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,793
but dude, like, unless you step to him,
it's gonna be like this.

215
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,532
All right, man.
Double the muscle on every stash we got.

216
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,008
And if the man coming,
make ready for the man.

217
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,475
It's not personal.

218
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,518
I swear to God,
it is never personal with me.

219
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,559
Truth is, I've been a councilman
for almost three years now.

220
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,352
And that's a long fucking time
to be ignored.

221
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,430
And this being Baltimore...

222
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,523
a white boy doesn't stand much chance
running citywide.

223
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,068
Maybe the legislature,
if the right seat opens up.

224
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,604
But until then,
I'm stuck in a job with no power...

225
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,731
except getting potholes filled.

226
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,369
All due respect, Councilman...

227
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,937
you're fucking with me because,
what, you're bored?

228
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,673
A little, yeah.

229
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,976
And what the fuck?
I mean, when it comes to the crime thing...

230
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,248
this city can use
all the fucking help it can get.

231
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:48,622
- Lf you're looking for dirt, there isn't any.
- There's always fucking dirt.

232
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,252
But right now, I'm just looking to know
how we can do better.

233
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,388
And you give me that much...

234
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,559
and I can try and get you
what you need privately.

235
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,068
No hearings, no press, no grandstanding.

236
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,071
And if I don't play ball...

237
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,439
you're gonna have my ass every time
I'm in front of your committee, right?

238
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,446
- One thing comes to mind.
- Shoot.

239
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,883
I can't get my marked units back
from Dickman Street to save my life.

240
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,789
Cars that are shopped for service
don't come back for weeks.

241
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,622
You tell the Mayor?

242
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,723
- Not that you heard it from me.
- Of course not.

243
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,932
- How much these?
- $10,000 a set.

244
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,541
A nigga show that on a ride,
he hanging a sign on himself.

245
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,110
"Lock my ass up."

246
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,007
No shit.

247
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,539
So how you gonna play it?

248
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,215
If they from the Terrace, that's Avon.

249
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,850
- I know.
- And Avon, he coming home, too.

250
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,959
Well, if you inclined to work something out,
that's one thing.

251
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,391
If not, Avon can seriously handle up.

252
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,523
I know.

253
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,298
So if you want to hold on to what's yours,
you best be ready.

254
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:10,943
You remember that Barksdale kid?
The one who took all the weight?

255
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,504
You remember that Barksdale kid?
The one who took all the weight?

256
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:20,081
Tied his neck to a doorknob
in the prison library and sat his ass down.

257
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,786
I don't know.

258
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,314
Men of color usually don't do themselves.

259
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,060
I mean, take me, for instance.

260
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,391
Yeah, I mean,
you got all the reason in the world.

261
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,863
And yet here I am, still standing.

262
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,867
Give or take.

263
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,299
- You looked at the scene photos?
- No, there ain't none.

264
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,904
State Police dogged it.

265
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,242
My turn, Bunk.

266
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,785
Come on. Go with number three.

267
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,265
You gonna play my song, darling?

268
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,363
- You play the right song...
- Hey, Bunk.

269
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,441
...I can make you hit the high notes, baby.
- Hey, Bunk.

270
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,771
- Hey, look, I saw her first, Jimmy.
- Come on, man.

271
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,902
Come on, baby.
I got a place right here in Camden.

272
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,139
Come on, be a gentleman, come on.

273
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,842
- I'm being a gentleman, man.
- I'm really not interested, okay?

274
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,579
- Come on, let's go.
- It's all pink, baby.

275
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,050
I'm really sorry, he's had
a bit too much to drink, you know?

276
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,648
It's okay. Thank you. Thanks.

277
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,623
- You all right?
- Yeah.

278
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,860
- You get yourself home?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,935
Knock it out.

280
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,342
- No, the baddest nigga of all time?
- Who?

281
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,504
This nigga from New York,
from the olden days, Bumpy something.

282
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,842
- Bumpy?
- Yo.

283
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,076
He'd do shit like run up
to a police station by hisself.

284
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,153
- No.
- You know what I'm saying, shit like that.

285
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,849
Cops be like hiding, like,
"Yo, Bumpy, we sorry, man, we sorry."

286
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,255
"Please go away. Please, please."

287
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,521
Woof.

288
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,074
And obtain gainful employment and refrain
from associating with known criminals...

289
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,975
and keep this office informed
of your residence...

290
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,843
and any change in that residence.

291
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,508
So I gather you're not working
at this particular time.

292
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,643
They still doing morning shape-ups
down at the market?

293
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,848
I don't know and I don't care.
Just get a job, any job.

294
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,792
- "Woof"?
- "Woof," like a dog.

295
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,661
- Oh shit, it was <i>like...</i>
- It was Cheese's boy, Tri.

296
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,333
So you gonna hit back or what?

297
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:01,139
- You got a better shot of the ligature?
- Yeah. Inside.

298
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,710
What'd he do, hang himself twice?

299
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,415
He could have been leaning
straight forward until he blacked out...

300
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,617
then slid down,
which would give you the vertical.

301
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,923
Or how about I come up at him
from behind <i>and...</i>

302
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,823
And then set him down,
make it look like, "Goodbye cruel world."

303
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,096
- What do the scene shots show?
- There were none taken.

304
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,501
The troopers really fucked the pooch
on this one.

305
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,665
All I have is some half-assed report.

306
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,744
Reads like the investigator
went off his Ritalin.

307
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:37,144
- What's a "large ecchy"...
- Large ecchymotic area, mid-back.

308
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,078
Bruising.

309
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,019
What, mid-back as <i>in...</i>

310
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,818
Or he banged himself a few days earlier
in the shower. But yeah, maybe.

311
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,553
Nothing like a definite maybe.

312
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,153
<i>Tri finally got that M. Done it on foot, too.</i>

313
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,161
Caroline?

314
00:23:55,734 --> 00:24:00,330
<i>Nigger lying in chalk, but my boy, Tri,</i>
<i>got that dapple all up his sleeve.</i>

315
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,307
<i>Looks like polka dots. But that's just</i>
<i>something you gotta know from experience.</i>

316
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,706
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

317
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,640
<i>I even had to school him on the whistle,</i>
<i>still walking around with it.</i>

318
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,247
<i>"Yo, Tri, stash that shit at Neesey's.</i>
<i>What's wrong with you?"</i>

319
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,713
<i>You know them niggers</i>
<i>is gonna get mad busy over this.</i>

320
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,457
<i>- So we getting busy, too.</i>
<i>- So what time you coming over?</i>

321
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,757
<i>Damn, bitch, ain't you even listening?</i>

322
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,457
<i>You still there?</i>

323
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,404
Shakedown!

324
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,270
Time-out.

325
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,050
- Do that again.
- Do what again?

326
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,179
Do that thing with your hand.
Do it in my face.

327
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,551
What the fuck you talking...

328
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,786
Whoa, man.

329
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,824
Got a lot of room in here!

330
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,796
The law think they can do
what the fuck they want.

331
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,328
Yo, I ain't do nothing.

332
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,742
Fuck the police!

333
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,974
- No, man, we was just hanging.
- Just slinging.

334
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,513
How'd you work it out
with the corner crews...

335
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,711
all you guys from the Terrace
coming in like this?

336
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,721
- I don't know what you talking about.
- Well, you best watch your ass.

337
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,020
'Cause the slingers out here,
they're like the crack babies' babies.

338
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,390
Man, every year everybody's like...

339
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,362
"Yeah, these kids out here,
they're a new breed.

340
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,764
"I ain't never seen nothing like this before.
This the end of the world now."

341
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,929
Look around you, fuckhead. This seem like
the dawn of a new day to you?

342
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,668
Can I go now?
Or you want to slap me up some more first?

343
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,640
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,588
How about a hand job?

345
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,757
My man, you don't even get
Weezy Jefferson for a hand job.

346
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,832
Come on.

347
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,531
- Dozerman.
- Wanna call it a day?

348
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,144
<i>They came back on us this time.</i>
<i>Daz and them. They got Peanut.</i>

349
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,005
<i>- Oh, shit, is Peanut dead?</i>
<i>- No, he's okay.</i>

350
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,947
<i>His brains are all over the sidewalk.</i>
<i>But he's okay.</i>

351
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,486
<i>What the hell do you think?</i>

352
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,182
<i>Shit, I got to call Tony. I'll get back at you.</i>

353
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,552
<i>All right.</i>

354
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,817
- Well, that's two we heard about.
- What the hell's going on?

355
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,396
Drug war maybe?

356
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,466
<i>- What's up?</i>
<i>- Nothing good, man.</i>

357
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,762
<i>I ain't sleep since I capped his ass.</i>

358
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:50,201
<i>Close my eyes, see him laying there</i>
<i>all bloody and shit.</i>

359
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:53,476
<i>Cheese, man, you did what you had to do.</i>

360
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,544
<i>What I thought I had to do.</i>

361
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,705
That's Cheese?

362
00:26:56,815 --> 00:27:00,717
<i>He was my dawg, yo.</i>
<i>Had much love for me, even then.</i>

363
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,849
<i>I ain't never gonna find another dog</i>
<i>like that.</i>

364
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,589
<i>- Well, they paying for it now.</i>
<i>- Mos def.</i>

365
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,560
For months, these assholes
show perfect phone discipline.

366
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,961
Now, they're talking up murders?

367
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:19,002
Cheese is only a level below
Proposition Joe.

368
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,095
All of a sudden, this case has legs.

369
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,970
<i>- Homicide.</i>
- This is Freamon, Major Case.

370
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,600
- Who's the O.I.C. Tonight?
<i>- Hold on for Norris.</i>

371
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,908
<i>Yo, T. T man.</i>

372
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,250
<i>I'm shot! I'm shot!</i>

373
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,450
<i>Oh, shit. Shit!</i>

374
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,145
<i>They coming back!</i>

375
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,590
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

376
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,292
<i>Who this?</i>

377
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,828
Damn.

378
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,561
<i>Detective Norris.</i>

379
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,158
Ed, this is Lester.

380
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,066
<i>I hear you're catching bodies</i>
<i>on the east side.</i>

381
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,605
You hear it?
Like what, "probable cause" hear it?

382
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,040
Like, "I got something concrete" hear it?
Or just, "gas up my head" hear it?

383
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,170
<i>Like, "I got all the fucking time in the world</i>
<i>to jaw with you" hear it?</i>

384
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,579
- How many bodies you got, Eddie?
- "How many you got, Eddie?"

385
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,912
Asshole.

386
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,787
- You want me to go up to Homicide?
- No, I got it, I got it.

387
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,224
You're early man on tomorrow.
So go home. See your kid.

388
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,095
I'm telling you,
this kid Berman's a fucking wizard.

389
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,893
I mean, check it out, right?

390
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,128
Six reported auto thefts,
two of which state:

391
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,397
"Not impossible car was borrowed."

392
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,167
Making four auto thefts,
with two unfounded.

393
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,835
And the prizewinner?
Four armed robberies...

394
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,003
two of which complainants state,
"Too dark to I.D. Weapon.

395
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,275
"Not impossible knife wasn't a comb."

396
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,476
- He might have groomed them to death.
- Yeah.

397
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,280
Wine into water.

398
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,585
There he is.

399
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,556
- Abbadabba Berman.
- The Dr. Atkins of crime.

400
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,956
Just doing what I'm told.

401
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,191
- God, what a beautiful film.
- I couldn't understand a word.

402
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,997
Honey, you gotta read the subtitles.

403
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,366
Oh, shit.

404
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,264
Does y'all go to the movies?

405
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:10,805
And you must be the lovely Mrs. Herc.
How'd you like your movie?

406
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,010
Okay.

407
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,451
Herc and Carver here,
they try to snatch us up every day...

408
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,682
like, "Where the shit? Who got the shit?"

409
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,384
But they never get nothing.

410
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,687
So y'all go to the movies.

411
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:26,889
Damn.

412
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,866
All right, then. See you tomorrow.

413
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,601
Everything okay?

414
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,013
On two.

415
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,050
Pick up, pick up.

416
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,313
- Ed, you got to help me.
- I can't, not now.

417
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,072
<i>And a bucket full of worms.</i>

418
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,741
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

419
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,349
So.

420
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,084
So.

421
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,386
Everything good?

422
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,231
How's that fontanette?

423
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,735
Fontanelle.

424
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,802
Is he closing up?

425
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,046
He won't close for a while.

426
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,408
Good.

427
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,383
- Good?
<i>- I can't stand it anymore!</i>

428
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,115
<i>Come on, sweetheart,</i>
<i>just a few more seconds.</i>

429
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,556
Well, I'm just saying.

430
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,790
<i>I ain't sleep since I capped his ass.</i>

431
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,161
<i>Close my eyes, see him laying there</i>
<i>all bloody and shit.</i>

432
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,232
- Cheese.
- Cheese on a platter.

433
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,839
He never talks like that.

434
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,670
Now, why would...

435
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,805
Because all good things come
to those who wait.

436
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,812
- Does McNulty know?
- I'll raise his ass.

437
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,347
We'll keep our ears to the wire,
keep gathering string, no problem.

438
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,990
But if bodies keep falling
in the Eastern District...

439
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,718
we might have to give up this wiretap.

440
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,963
Now you coming around?

441
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,000
Been more than a damn year.

442
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,898
Looks just like his dad, huh?

443
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,973
Let me ask you.

444
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,180
When you heard D was a suicide,
what'd you think?

445
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,953
Hey, little fella. Come here.

446
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,558
Yeah.

447
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,293
Here's the thing, we got a tip.

448
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,530
And the autopsy report, it backs us up.

449
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,800
Can you put him down, please?

450
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,968
Sure.

451
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,316
You know, I'm sorry about your loss.

452
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,817
He seemed like a pretty decent guy,
all things considered.

453
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:19,521
So when I found out about this,
I felt like I owed him.

454
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,063
The last thing I wanted to do was upset you
if there was no point to it.

455
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,329
<i>So...</i>

456
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,038
<i>So...</i>

457
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,614
If there's anything I can help with
or any questions you need answered...

458
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,114
or whatever.

459
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,192
Major, how many people
are under your command?

460
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,094
278, sir.

461
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,764
278.

462
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,768
And how many felony arrests
did they make last month?

463
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,639
Don't bother.

464
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,406
You made sixteen.

465
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,945
Sixteen in a month.

466
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,846
Same time period.
How many handguns you pick up?

467
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,883
All shifts, all sectors.

468
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,888
Once again, don't bother.
The answer is "none."

469
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,649
None.

470
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,789
You had four bodies last night
in how many hours?

471
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,424
- Shut the fucking book, how many hours?
- Seven.

472
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,196
Try five.

473
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,671
Tell me about this kid.

474
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,407
- I believe his name is James...
- James Toney.

475
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,572
When's the last time he was arrested?

476
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,944
With who?

477
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,749
Where's he sling?

478
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,581
How about this guy?

479
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,991
Or him? Or him?

480
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,357
You know what? You got four bodies,
all within two blocks of each other...

481
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,900
and you can't even start to connect
the fucking dots.

482
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,164
You got eight hours to get a grip
on this mess or you're done. You hear me?

483
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,431
Done.

484
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,766
Marlo?

485
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,948
You know I'm with Avon, right?

486
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,141
Stringer Bell?

487
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,888
Can we talk?

488
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,084
I need you to walk back up there
and pack up your people.

489
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,336
I'm being a gentleman about it
for the moment.

490
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,874
You offer up what you have on this,
you start the clock running on yourselves.

491
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,044
The wiretap has to surface in court.

492
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,281
- No way around it.
- She's right.

493
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,455
We finally got something
worth listening to...

494
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,220
and you're talking about
giving up the wire?

495
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,385
Makes no sense.

496
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,087
There's a war going on.

497
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,464
We might have four more bodies tonight.

498
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,557
This is Baltimore, we might have six.

499
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,967
I watched Marvin Taylor from the Eastern
get his asshole ripped today...

500
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,538
because he has no fucking clue.

501
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,129
I don't believe this.

502
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,265
We got top lieutenants
talking about murders...

503
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,674
and we can't figure out
just to shut up and take notes?

504
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,805
We got bodies on the ground, Jimmy.
That's got to matter for something.

505
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,145
No, if we're at Cheese
then we're close to Prop Joe...

506
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,583
and if we're close to Joe,
then we're close to Stringer.

507
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,847
That has to matter.

508
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,413
Look, I was right there with you
when we left Stringer on the street.

509
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,186
And it grinds me, too.

510
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,728
But the fact is we didn't create this unit
just to lock up dope dealers.

511
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,095
There's a narcotics unit downtown for that.

512
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,964
We're about the violence.
Have been from the jump.

513
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,662
Barksdale was violent.

514
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:24,798
But right now, Stringer's quiet
and over on the East side, we got bodies.

515
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,337
We got enough from the tap...

516
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,443
to take a real good shot at Cheese.

517
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,105
Put a murder case or two together...

518
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:34,207
you may be able to roll someone up
at Proposition Joe or Stringer.

519
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,809
As far as bodies go, four's a big number.

520
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,987
Okay, then. As of now,
we use the phones to work these murders.

521
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,925
<i>- Yo, we bracing up, son.</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

522
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,291
<i>Gather yourself, nigga.</i>

523
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,922
<i>We got a bead on Daz.</i>
<i>Be at Neesey's crib in a hour.</i>

524
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,365
<i>Daz be with Neesey?</i>
<i>I thought that was your girl.</i>

525
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,396
Neesey, huh? Got it.

526
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,199
<i>We just hooking up there,</i>
<i>and going to the battle.</i>

527
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,967
<i>Bring your whistle, in a hour. One.</i>

528
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,204
Mount up.

529
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,680
Caroline, call Q.R.T. With that 20
and stay on the wire.

530
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,144
- We're on channel two.
- All right.

531
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,955
Yo, Tri, what size fries you want?

532
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,055
What?

533
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,367
Go!

534
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,629
- Police! Search Warrant!
- Freeze!

535
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,829
Hands up!

536
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,400
Put your hands up!
Get down on the ground!

537
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,941
- Freeze!
- Go! Come on, let's go!

538
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:11,008
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
Hands on your head!

539
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,381
Okay, Mary Tyler Moore, buck-naked.

540
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,681
Open the door, here I come...

541
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,791
drop my attaché case down,
bend her over...

542
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,085
give it to her on the ottoman,
and she's like:

543
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,459
"Oh, Rob. Oh, Rob."

544
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,658
- Who's Rob?
- It's from the show.

545
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,024
Done.

546
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,626
Mary Kate and Ashley. I don't want to say.

547
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,172
Just accept whatever pictures
are on my mind right now.

548
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,570
Anybody else?

549
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,474
Yeah, Dozerman's girl, what's her name?

550
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,445
She's baking a cake, naked.

551
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,944
White flour splotches
all over her fine brown skin.

552
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,051
I come in, in a chef's hat, nothing else on...

553
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,985
Johnson out to here and say:

554
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,321
"That's no way to stir a batter.
Here, let me try to get..."

555
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,891
- Bobby! Hey!
- Hey, Doze.

556
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,129
- What's up?
- Done, now the guy.

557
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,931
This is a hard one
for anybody to understand.

558
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,663
I mean, it's got nothing to do with sex.

559
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,473
It's about sympathy.

560
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,642
- It's about giving a guy a break.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

561
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,809
Gus Triandos.

562
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,484
Who's Gus Triandos?

563
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,985
A catcher with the Orioles back in the day.

564
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,819
Me and my brother had his card.
Sorry-looking motherfucker, man.

565
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:32,362
I mean, he looked like this little kid
who got left at a bus station by his parents.

566
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,930
You know why?

567
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,301
Because he had to catch
Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckleball.

568
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,869
Five fucking years.

569
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,665
The worst gig in baseball.

570
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,036
It was like trying to catch
a greased pig with wings.

571
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,770
I mean, he even told a reporter once,
"Wilhelm nearly ruined me."

572
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,681
Gus Triandos. Big slow guy.

573
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,642
- Good choice.
- Go ahead, say it.

574
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,844
- I know you want to say it.
- Say what? There's nothing to say.

575
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,480
- Nothing?
- You put a lot of thought into it.

576
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,319
- It's cool.
- Okay.

577
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,756
Okay. Tonight, three things.

578
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,291
Number one.

579
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,267
Keep your incident numbers sequential
or it's gonna be a stone mess tomorrow.

580
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,358
Number two.

581
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,031
We'll be photographing
evidence at the scene.

582
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,042
That means don't bag anything
until you get the shot off.

583
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,737
And number three,
don't embarrass yourselves.

584
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,874
Make sure your camera's loaded with film.

585
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,719
Okay, mount up.

586
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,421
So Cheese, who's your dawg?

587
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,384
You my dawg.

588
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,725
I just want to know who's your dawg.

589
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,821
Dawg.

590
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,128
What's this, some psychology?

591
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,863
Yeah, okay. Yo, please stop, stop.

592
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,964
I'll tell you everything I know.

593
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,969
Come on, Cheese.

594
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,712
Who's your dawg?

595
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,143
Hell, no.

596
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,379
Hell, you ain't laying no bodies
on me, man.

597
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,715
Lawyer time.

598
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,423
"He was my dawg, man."

599
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,024
"I ain't sleep since I capped his ass.

600
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,924
"Looking up at me all bloody and shit.

601
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,067
"He had much love for me...

602
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:22,101
"even then.
I ain't never gonna find another."

603
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,903
Man, you all some
cold-ass motherfuckers, man.

604
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,077
We got you on tape.

605
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,846
So what happened, Cheese?

606
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,059
I thought he punked me, all right?
So I did what I had to do.

607
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,830
Which was?

608
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:49,897
Lit him up.

609
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,495
Well, he's talking anyway.

610
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,734
Well, what's done is done.

611
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,214
But, maybe we can help you on this.

612
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,948
How? You gonna bring him back?

613
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,019
No, on the consequences.

614
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,847
Help us help you.

615
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,350
- What?
- Maybe we can trade up.

616
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,519
Trade up for what, man? For this?

617
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,687
- What the fuck...
- Proposition Joe.

618
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:24,667
You give us Prop Joe and maybe we look
at this whole thing with Dawg differently.

619
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,169
Now, why would I be talking
about Prop Joe <i>behind...</i>

620
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,274
You know what, man?
I don't even know no Prop Joe.

621
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,742
Okay. Dawg?

622
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,179
Which one of these is he?
Where's that body?

623
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,541
Where I left it, most likely.

624
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,748
- Warehouse on the East Side.
- And he still there?

625
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:46,016
Far as I know.
Unless the SPCA come around.

626
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,386
What?

627
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,252
Looks like they broke him.

628
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,565
I got to say,
you really showed me something on this.

629
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:05,202
What can I possibly add to that?
Except, I owe you one, Cedric.

630
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:17,614
You ever have one of those
"have your cake and eat it, too" days?

631
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,621
I believe this could be my first.

632
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,853
Tell me something good.

633
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,959
We're charging him.

634
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:32,126
Improper disposal of an animal.
Discharging a firearm in city limits.

635
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,932
Animal cruelty,
if you want to run wild with it.

636
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,944
Go ahead, call me a cocksucker.

637
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,348
- You know you wanna.
- Excuse me?

638
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,210
You know, I actually looked up
the stats on Gus Triandos.

639
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,086
Power hitter, right?

640
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,520
Fuck the both of you.

641
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,905
Later, dawg.

642
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,574
Kiss my ass.

643
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,444
- Goodnight, Bunk.
- Goodnight.

644
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,245
Funny day.

645
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,850
I'm the new departmental pet
for shutting down a drug war.

646
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,988
But I blew my wire for a dead terrier.

647
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,300
You remember how you said...

648
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:42,802
you hoped today would be your first
"have your cake and eat it, too" day?

649
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,899
What about it?

650
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,629
Okay, gents.

651
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:16,695
You see the brake lights pump twice,
you know we got a clean hand-to-hand.

652
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,908
So I get in this morning
and I'm looking at three phone messages...

653
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,450
from Buddy Ferraro over at DPW.

654
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,156
All assuring me that I'll have 20 radio cars
back in service...

655
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,720
at the end of the week.

656
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,089
Buddy and my old man go way back.

657
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:40,125
Made their First Communion together
at St. Leo's.

658
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,197
So, what else do you need?

659
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,766
And you didn't go to the Mayor with it?

660
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,739
Did you get your cars?

661
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,269
Did anyone get fucked over it?
Or did your job just get a little easier?

662
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,121
I got 70 cops retiring at the end of the year
that I know of...

663
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,919
and no money for academy class.

664
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,291
Well, the Mayor fucked you, 'cause I know
that money was in the budget.

665
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,921
The Mayor delayed it till next summer.

666
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,334
I mean less troops, less salary,
less bennies.

667
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:23,030
I mean, even a six-month delay
saves the city $2, $3 million.

668
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,136
Let me talk to some people.

669
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,472
Yeah?

670
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,580
<i>- Major Colvin?</i>
- Yeah.

671
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,605
<i>This is the Com Center.</i>

672
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:44,381
<i>I'm sorry to inform you of this, sir, but</i>
<i>we have an officer down in your district.</i>

673
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,923
Which hospital?

674
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,531
I just got the lease, <i>so...</i>

675
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,348
Fucking solo cars.
I should have teamed him. I fucked up.

676
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,014
Dead-ass motherfucker's dead.

677
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,710
If we catch up to him,
he don't come in alive.

678
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,652
Right?

679
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,330
Nicked jugular, shattered jaw.

680
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,466
He'll live.

681
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,613
Give me one of those.

682
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,519
I just got back from Shock Trauma.

683
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,455
You guys saved his ass
getting him down as fast as you did.

684
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,656
So who do we got for a suspect?

685
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:07,000
Number one male, white T-shirt,
baggy jeans, tennis shoes.

686
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,037
In the wind,
but we're locking it down out there.

687
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,932
So what's this I hear about the gun?

688
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,677
Doze tried to return fire,
he dropped his piece.

689
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,341
Some fuck picks it up and books.

690
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,743
I mean, I can't believe this shit.

691
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,482
- I'll take it.
- No.

692
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,455
No, no, no.

693
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,224
It'll be nicer when I fix the place up.

694
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,262
Cedric, I don't care.

695
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,651
No, tell him I'm cooked.
I just got done at the hospital, I'm all in.

696
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,188
<i>Well, he was asking if you could</i>
<i>maybe talk to the reporters.</i>

697
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,622
He doesn't want me
talking to reporters right now.

698
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,352
<i>- All right.</i>
- That would truly be unwise.

699
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,588
<i>- All right, all right, I'll tell him.</i>
- All right.

700
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,928
Bunny, you look hellacious.

701
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,264
You got any coffee going in there?

702
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,039
You know what I was thinking?

703
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,841
That tonight's a good night.

704
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,441
Why?

705
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,073
Because my shot cop didn't die.

706
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,086
And it hit me.

707
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,383
This is what makes
a good night on my watch.

708
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,959
Absence of a negative.

709
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,056
It was a good night.

710
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,122
Here's the thing.

711
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,395
Six months from now, I'm gone.

712
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,871
I put in my 30 and the only thing
that'll be left of me on that job...

713
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,707
is an 8"-by-11" framed picture
in the Western hallway.

714
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,139
But you know what?

715
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,711
The shit out there.

716
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:40,051
The city is worse than when I first came on.

717
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,755
So what does that say about me?

718
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,396
About my life?

719
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,029
Come on, man. You're talking about drugs.

720
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,159
That's a force of nature.

721
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:57,138
That's sweeping leaves on a windy day,
whoever the hell you are.

722
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,441
You fought the good fight.

723
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,850
Not a call since we gave it up to Cheese.

724
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,189
What did you expect?

725
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,824
Attention.

726
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,106
Be seated.

727
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,810
Regarding Officer Dozerman...

728
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,017
his condition has been upgraded
to "guarded."

729
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,420
I'm told he can receive visits,
and he's been moved to Recovery Unit.

730
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,092
As of this tour...

731
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:01,294
all hand-to-hand undercover buys of CDS...

732
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,370
are suspended in the Western District.

733
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,506
You're kidding me.

734
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,378
Somewheres...

735
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,583
back in the dawn of time...

736
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,887
this district had itself a civic dilemma
of epic proportion.

737
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,720
The city council had just passed a law
that forbid alcoholic consumption...

738
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,163
in public places, on the streets...

739
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,793
and on the corners.

740
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,834
But the corner is, and it was,
and it always will be...

741
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,131
the poor man's lounge.

742
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,504
It's where a man wants to be
on a hot summer's night.

743
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:45,670
It's cheaper than a bar, catch a nice breeze,
you watch the girls go by.

744
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,574
But the law is the law.

745
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,120
And the Western cops rolling by,
what were they gonna do?

746
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,222
If they arrested every dude out there
for tipping back a High Life...

747
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:01,593
there'd be no other time
for any other kind of police work.

748
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,060
And if they looked the other way?

749
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:08,268
They'd open themselves
to all kinds of flaunting.

750
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,067
All kinds of disrespect.

751
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,611
Now, this is before my time
when it happened, but...

752
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:21,112
somewhere back in the '50s or '60s...

753
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,546
there was a small moment
of goddamn genius...

754
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:29,614
by some nameless smokehound
who comes out the Cut Rate one day...

755
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,894
and on his way to the corner...

756
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,288
he slips that just-bought
pint of elderberry...

757
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:37,964
into a paper bag.

758
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:43,035
A great moment of civic compromise.

759
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:47,001
That small wrinkled-ass paper bag...

760
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,636
allowed the corner boys
to have their drink in peace...

761
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,582
and it gave us permission...

762
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:57,378
to go and do police work.

763
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,716
The kind of police work
that's actually worth the effort.

764
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:09,021
That's worth actually taking a bullet for.

765
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,063
Dozerman...

766
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,971
he got shot last night trying to buy...

767
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,403
three vials.

768
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,368
Three!

769
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,519
There's never been a paper bag...

770
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,318
for drugs.

771
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,659
Until now.

772
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,668
If we ain't doing hand-to-hands,
then what the fuck?

773
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:56,679
And the shit with the bag?

774
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,645
What the fuck is that?
