00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:29,955
I'm strong!

3
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm big!

4
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,794
I'm hot!

5
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,129
I'm big!

6
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,838
Fuck!

7
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,703
Shit!

8
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,120
Hey, where you going?

9
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,632
<i>My name is Daniel Lugo.</i>

10
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>And I believe in fitness.</i>

11
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,486
<i>"ED". The events you are about to see
took place</i>

12
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:30,193
<i>in Miami, Florida, between
October 1994 and June '95.</i>

13
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,074
<i>Unfortunately, this is a true story.</i>

14
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,705
<i>We all start out equal,</i>

15
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,381
<i>little blobs of blood and muscle.</i>

16
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,254
<i>It's a setup of awesome potential.</i>

17
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,591
<i>Most people never
develop that potential.</i>

18
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,473
<i>- I knew early on I was not most people.</i>

19
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,522
There you go. There you go!
Yes!

20
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,018
Come on, big man.
Work it, baby. Come on!

21
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,686
Let's go!

22
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,363
<i>Because if you're willing to do the work,</i>

23
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,985
<i>you can have anything.</i>

24
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,693
<i>That's what makes the US of A great.</i>

25
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,119
<i>When it started,</i>

26
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,947
<i>America was just a handful
of scrawny colonies.</i>

27
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,204
<i>Now, it's the most buff,
pumped-up country on the planet.</i>

28
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,455
<i>- That's pretty rad.</i>

29
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,041
That's it?

30
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,498
- Work harder.
- Shit!

31
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,759
- Oh! Adrian's on the juice!
- Word up, DL!

32
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,220
<i>Most people say
they want to look better.</i>

33
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,050
<i>Not everyone is willing
to do whatever it takes to achieve it.</i>

34
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,601
<i>All of my heroes are self-made.</i>

35
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,271
<i>Rocky, Scarf ace,
all the guys from The Godfather.</i>

36
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,850
<i>They all started out with nothing
and built their way to perfection.</i>

37
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,402
<i>The way to prove yourself
is to better yourself.</i>

38
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,024
<i>That's the American dream.</i>

39
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,532
<i>I have no sympathy
for people who squander their gifts.</i>

40
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,827
<i>It's sickening.</i>

41
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,998
<i>It's worse than sickening.
It's unpatriotic.</i>

42
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,245
Greatest day of my life.

43
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,998
Arnold-fucking-Schwarzenegger,
am I right?

44
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,457
I was never a big fitness guy.
I know it's important,

45
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,383
but you know what
I really don't like about weights?

46
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,756
What's that?

47
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,178
They're so heavy!

48
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,176
Am <i>I</i> right?

49
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,011
Can you lift this?

50
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,345
<i>I spot people for a living,
when you get right down to it.</i>

51
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,271
<i>Gives the client security
and a little extra help</i>

52
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,269
<i>to push themselves harder.</i>

53
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,443
To me, a cigarette boat was a thing
drug dealers had, you know?

54
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,523
But we got it anyway. Cost a fortune.

55
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,077
Named her <i>Puppy Luv.</i>
L-U-V. But when I'm out on it,

56
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,779
depending on the day, I either fantasize

57
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,331
I'm a drug smuggler eluding the DEA,

58
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,955
or I'm the DEA
chasing after a drug smuggler.

59
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,002
I'm turning into a stud here.

60
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,750
You get any exercise currently?

61
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,081
Eh... Besides shtupping?

62
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,383
I got a three mil McMansion
next to a private jogging path,

63
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,880
but it's all homos and housewives.

64
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,256
You spend most of your day at a desk?

65
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,304
You know that Schlotzsky's Deli
near the airport'?

66
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,471
That's mine.

67
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,470
NO kidding? Oh, I like that place.

68
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,892
I never kid, Yudo.

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,761
- Lugo.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,976
We make a nice sandwich, Lugy.

71
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,558
You ever try our oven-toasted
roast beef and cheese?

72
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,939
- Give an anorexic an appetite.
- What else do you do?

73
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,736
Do some stock trading, real estate.

74
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,985
Own a few greyhounds for racing.

75
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,032
But for some crazy reason,
I'm proudest of the sandwiches.

76
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,825
I hang at the house.
Got a hot Cuban housekeeper

77
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,995
makes a waffle don't
even need maple syrup.

78
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,072
I'm a self-made man, Dennis.

79
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,500
And my self is not ashamed to
say it's made a lot of money.

80
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,328
Maybe your self
ought to spend some of it on a salad.

81
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,290
You know who invented salad?

82
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,499
Poor people.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,509
<i>This all began because
it was time to push myself harder.</i>

84
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,009
<i>To maximize results.</i>

85
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,932
<i>And I was tired of clients petting me.</i>

86
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
<i>Shit, otherwise
I was looking at another 40 years</i>

87
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,928
<i>of wearing sweatpants to work.</i>

88
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,440
And that was it!
He just dumped me by phone.

89
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,516
That's cold!

90
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,601
It makes you question
the whole relationship.

91
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,730
<i>You set high goals for yourself
and nail every one.</i>

92
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,986
<i>But the hardest thing
about changing yourself</i>

93
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,534
<i>is changing how other people see you.</i>

94
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,863
<i>Being a personal trainer
is just that. Personal.</i>

95
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,947
<i>I'm not going to lie.</i>

96
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,158
<i>When a client doesn't
feel the same way,</i>

97
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,493
<i>it hurts.</i>

98
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,828
What next?

99
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,375
Well, I mean, if you wanted,

100
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,627
you know, if it seems
like it would be fun to you,

101
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,959
maybe we could go for a drink

102
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,669
or a dinner or a coffee or water.

103
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,468
I meant what exercise is next.

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,053
<i>Il' really fucking hurts.</i>

105
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,512
I know that!
I was joking. Come on!

106
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,358
Daniel! I see you got some new meat.

107
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,235
What have I always said, John?

108
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,530
The key to repeat business...

109
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,324
ls new business. You cannot build
a muscle mecca without muscle.

110
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,573
Well, I want to turn this place

111
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,280
into an internationally renowned mecca.

112
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,874
- What do you bench?
- 400.

113
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,501
- Squat?
- More like five.

114
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,297
Why should I hire you?

115
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,919
You have a lot of elderly members, sir.

116
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,876
<i>I want to pump
some new blood into this place.</i>

117
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,336
That pool's a very slippery surface

118
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,421
and that elderly woman
with the shower cap,

119
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,848
<i>she looks like she's going to croak
right there in the pool, sir.</i>

120
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,598
And Gold's is going to crush you.

121
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,179
If I don't triple your membership
in three months, I will quit.

122
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,808
Triple it in three months.
That's pretty ambitious.

123
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,938
I read a lot of biographies, sir.

124
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,234
And the one thing that unites great men

125
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,938
is their reach always
exceeds their grasp.

126
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,776
One thing...
I recently had some trouble with the law.

127
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,698
<i>They call Florida "God's waiting room,"</i>

128
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,199
<i>all the half-dead senior citizens</i>

129
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,325
<i>turning brown on the beach.</i>

130
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,369
<i>Shit, you ask me, that's kind of mean.</i>

131
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,951
<i>I like older people.
They're very generous.</i>

132
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,502
So, you really guarantee

133
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,500
I can triple
my investment in three months?

134
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,877
Well, if I didn't, would I have
put my name on the company?

135
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,753
Let me confer with my partner.
Are they good?

136
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,094
- You're approved.
- Wow!

137
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,642
You know, I get so much joy
from making people money.

138
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,515
I'm going to make
you guys a lot of money.

139
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,474
You have such beautiful hair.

140
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,563
Look at those eyes. Wow!

141
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,526
I, Daniel Lugo, hereby
acknowledge my guilt.

142
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,947
I know what I did was wrong

143
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,275
and there is no substitute for hard work.

144
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,783
And I am a hard worker!
And it will never happen again.

145
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,863
For I used my superior intelligence

146
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,745
for wrong actions to justify a good end.

147
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,916
And that was wrong.

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,544
And, if you let me,
I believe I can learn from my mistakes

149
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,166
and I believe I can help others

150
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,966
to realize that there is
no shortcut to the American dream.

151
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,009
This is America, land of the brave

152
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,553
and home of the second chances.

153
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,175
That's my one ask,

154
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,427
that you give me a second chance

155
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,849
and allow me to go free today.

156
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,017
Guilty.

157
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,516
I know I'm guilty. That's what I said
in the beginning of my statement.

158
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,848
I said, "I'm guilty."
But what about my second chance?

159
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,645
That's nothing. Welcome aboard.

160
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,864
Thank you, sir. I will not disappoint you.

161
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,865
<i>Three weeks after I signed on,</i>

162
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,285
<i>Sun Gym did triple its membership.</i>

163
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,071
I'ma make you Kobe beef, baby.

164
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,913
One more!

165
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,208
<i>I gave free body waxing
for everybody at sign-up.</i>

166
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,535
<i>It was kind of disgusting.</i>

167
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,541
<i>You have to do whatever it takes
and have no fear.</i>

168
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,463
Ooh. Wow. Bushy.

169
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,166
You want to trim that thing
down a little bit?

170
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,126
<i>I even came up with genius.</i>

171
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,712
<i>Free membership
for strippers. Delicious.</i>

172
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,548
<i>Boosted membership 75%
within two months.</i>

173
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,225
Look like a big sirloin steak, baby!
I like that!

174
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,513
<i>I did make it a muscle mecca.</i>

175
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,813
<i>I made it a destination.</i>

176
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,107
<i>John was rolling in the cash.</i>

177
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,609
<i>He started reading Fortune magazine.</i>

178
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,531
<i>And he recognized my value.</i>

179
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,156
<i>I made Senior Fitness Coordinator
by Christmas.</i>

180
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,077
<i>Perks included.
'Cause that's how it works.</i>

181
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,780
<i>You give and you get back.</i>

182
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,827
<i>Oh, bills suck.</i>

183
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,660
<i>Rolled out into a money magnet.</i>

184
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,745
<i>I'm living the American dream.</i>

185
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,172
<i>Take notes and HI tell you the secrets</i>

186
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,749
<i>of living the dream!</i>

187
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,254
<i>Does your life suck balls?</i>

188
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,756
<i>Are you a hot mess?</i>

189
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,462
<i>Do you ever look in your mirror
at home and ask,</i>

190
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,513
<i>"Why me?" Well, go to Jonny Wu's</i>

191
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,887
<i>Golden Dream seminar
at the Jupiter Ballroom</i>

192
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,889
<i>and you'll find out how to be a do-er!</i>

193
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,264
<i>I got to say,
it felt great to be doing so awesome.</i>

194
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,483
- What is that stink?
- What stink?

195
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,772
You smell like a Cuban stripper.

196
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,277
My niece gave it to me for Christmas.

197
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,449
It's called "Vanilla Fella."

198
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,825
Oh, well, it's unsettling
while I sweat here.

199
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,206
So, you make decent coin in this place?

200
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,453
We do fine.

201
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,878
Shoots out your ass in taxes
though, right'?

202
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,631
Hey, if you're smart, you do what I do.

203
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,671
Incorporate offshore.

204
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,752
The Bahamas
don't exactly sweat your paperwork

205
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,804
and the IRS can't touch it.

206
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,636
You have any money here in the States?

207
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,308
Of course!

208
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,806
My offshore stuff is just

209
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,887
a rainy day fund, margarita money.

210
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,393
You should meet my accountant,

211
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,145
he's a friggin' miracle man.

212
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,350
Maybe I will.

213
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,936
Oh, you're a Maybe Guy!

214
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,191
I misjudged.

215
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,524
I had you figured for
a Definitely Guy, Damien.

216
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,108
Sorry. Lugo. Lugo.

217
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,659
<i>Victor had</i> a <i>point.</i>

218
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,657
<i>I mean, he was an asshole,
but he had a point.</i>

219
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,282
<i>Michael Corleone didn't
become the Godfather by folding towels.</i>

220
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,914
<i>He did it by keeping a gun behind
the toilet and knowing what he wants.</i>

221
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,586
<i>And I know it might sound strange,</i>

222
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,507
<i>I just want a big fat lawn
that I can mow until the sun goes down.</i>

223
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,334
That baby's 20% off!

224
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,669
Well, if I believe I deserve it,

225
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,253
the universe will serve it, right?

226
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,547
What, you never heard that before?

227
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,261
No, jackass.

228
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,842
Yeah, that's why
you're working at Sears, bro!

229
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,348
Easy, fella, or I'll kick your ass.

230
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,146
What is that? Is that a bug?

231
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,447
There's a bug! Do you read English?
Yeah? <i>Puta?</i> Bitch? Right?

232
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,444
Between the "B" and the "I."

233
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,321
You migrant workers suck!

234
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,447
<i>When I was young,</i>

235
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,278
<i>there was a rich kid
lived two blocks over.</i>

236
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,739
<i>Little prick had a new bike
every Christmas.</i>

237
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,870
Your <i>asses</i> are looking great!

238
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,075
<i>And his parents took him on vacations</i>

239
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,787
<i>to places like Paris and France.</i>

240
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,247
<i>I mean, I didn't hate him.</i>

241
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,753
<i>I just thought it'd be cool to see France.</i>

242
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,880
<i>But I knew that
wasn't ever going to happen</i>

243
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,927
<i>unless I did something about it.</i>

244
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,050
- Let's go, set...

245
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,298
Fuck!

246
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,221
Yo, what's going on, DL?

247
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,927
You've been unfocused all day, man.

248
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,350
You ever just get tired
of being where you are, Adrian?

249
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,648
No. I kind of like it here.
I mean, the weights are new...

250
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,647
I mean in life, man!
Where you are in life.

251
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,862
I mean, look at us, man.
We're like Superman.

252
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,032
I mean, come on!

253
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,822
Don't you think we deserve better?
'Cause I do.

254
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,990
Hey. Yo.

255
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,080
<i>Man, I do, too.</i>

256
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,037
Then fucking act like it, man!
Come on!

257
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,542
That's why when these 'roids kick into

258
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,374
this chocolate mass, baby,

259
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,925
I'ma be unstoppable!

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,673
<i>I ain't making no more tacos!</i>

261
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>I ain't cleaning up after nobody tacos!</i>

262
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,965
I'm putting my beef in their tacos, baby!

263
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,391
Everybody gonna eat some of this!

264
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,093
That's what I'm talking about.

265
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,721
I was like you.

266
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,681
You work hard.

267
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,017
You do what you're told.

268
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,898
And what does life serve you?

269
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,402
A shame sandwich
with a side order of shit!

270
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,274
You deserve better!

271
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,618
Every person in America

272
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,493
is either a do-er, or a don't-er.

273
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,035
A do-er or a don't-er.

274
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,084
And if I can get you
to learn one thing today,

275
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,880
one take-home point,

276
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,541
it would be this.

277
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,047
Don't be a don't-er.

278
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,755
Do be a do-er.

279
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,758
I had a wife, two beautiful daughters.

280
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,718
A perfect partner.

281
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,974
Thank God I left her!

282
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,728
Now I'm with seven honeys
of which I can choose from.

283
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,484
<i>Oh, my God.
This guy understands me.</i>

284
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,865
Well, it's simple.

285
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,534
I don't know
why God gave us 1O fingers,

286
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,782
because we's only gonna need three.

287
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,036
Get a goal. Get a plan.

288
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,250
And get up off your ass!

289
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,333
Which one are you, playboy?

290
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,841
Me?

291
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,964
No, someone else sitting in your seat.

292
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,631
Come on, which one are you?

293
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm a do-er?

294
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,766
Is that a question?

295
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,178
I'm a do-er.

296
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,184
What is this, Valentine's Day?

297
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,231
Say it like you want to hunt it, skin it

298
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,854
and mount its head on your wall!

299
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,811
- I'm a do-er!
- What?

300
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,313
- I'm a do-er!
- Yeah!

301
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,773
- I'm a do-er!
- Let's do it!

302
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,779
- I'm a do-er! I'm a do-er!

303
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,531
- Do-er!
- I'm a do-er!

304
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,328
Do-er! Do-er! Do-er!
- I'm a do-er!

305
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,073
I'm a do-er!

306
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,409
<i>He singled me out</i>

307
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,745
<i>and gave me my own
private training session.</i>

308
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,545
<i>I will make him proud.</i>

309
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,793
- I wish I had a camera.
- All right.

310
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,624
Get the bitches on the boat.
Okay? We got to go.

311
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,046
Get the bitches on the boat.

312
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,422
<i>We got to 9°!</i>

313
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,683
<i>I'm</i> a <i>do-er with a three-finger plan.</i>

314
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,765
<i>Finger one, find a guy with money.</i>

315
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,357
<i>Finger two,
make him give you everything he owns.</i>

316
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,356
<i>Finger three,</i>

317
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,692
<i>make America a better place.</i>

318
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,068
<i>Leave the guy broke and clueless</i>

319
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,024
<i>as to who made him that way.</i>

320
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,157
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

321
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,163
'Cause that's
some straight-up gangsta shit.

322
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,999
- Why do you want to do this?

323
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,294
She's out of your league, bro.

324
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,750
Wow.

325
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,417
Adrian, you're fucking magnificent.

326
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,343
You walked in that door,
you were 28% body fat,

327
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,420
you wanted to be six.

328
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,097
I gave you that.
You want to be two, I will give you that.

329
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,389
You deserve that.

330
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,513
You want to be a monument
to physical perfection?

331
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,344
You want to be a shrine?

332
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,437
You should be!

333
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,853
You wanted change, right?

334
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,311
All you got is change in that fanny pack.
Is that what you want?

335
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,190
When's the last time
you paid your rent when it was due?

336
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,110
When's the last time you took one of
those plump bitches out to dinner

337
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,286
and didn't sweat them ordering dessert?

338
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,283
You love those big bitches.

339
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,116
And they love to eat.
It's okay. That's important!

340
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,748
But this being broke shit's
got to stop, man.

341
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,080
You need some money
to go with that body, man.

342
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,220
<i>Adrian loved the idea.</i>

343
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,547
Hey, that guy wants a job.
Will you interview him?

344
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,803
<i>But to implement a plan of this intensity,</i>

345
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,510
<i>we needed to secure another operative.</i>

346
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,185
Where'd you do your time, pal?

347
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,766
Up north.

348
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,987
Club Fed Correctional. White collar.

349
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,689
I learned a lot. It's all businessmen.

350
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,780
Hey, how many grams of protein
do you eat?

351
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,037
How you fixed for a job now?

352
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,410
Well, it's not good.

353
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,371
It's kind of hard when you got a record.

354
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,001
I know.

355
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,328
It doesn't feel real good
when Mickey D's tells you

356
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,958
you're not even good enough
to make the French fries.

357
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,044
We all make mistakes.

358
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,796
Doesn't mean we have
less right to a piece of the pie.

359
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,380
Amino acids after you work out
or before?

360
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,517
So you do it with smoothies,
like, fruit smoothies,

361
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,559
- or just, like, soy milk?
- What?

362
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,683
Don't mind him. What were you in for?

363
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,526
<i>"PAUL".
Know why habit rhymes with rabbit?</i>

364
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,658
<i>'Cause your whole life
disappears down a bunny hole,</i>

365
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,749
<i>while you grow long sensitive ears</i>

366
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,919
<i>to better hear the sound
of sirens coming for you.</i>

367
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,836
<i>Lucky for me, I got saved.</i>

368
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,920
<i>Saving all of God's creatures
was my special mission.</i>

369
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,035
<i>You know, the Son of God
knew how to just say no.</i>

370
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,501
<i>I guess you could say
He's my role model.</i>

371
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,630
<i>Why Miami?</i>

372
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,417
<i>It was warm. It had beaches.</i>

373
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,170
<i>And I didn't have
any warrants in Florida.</i>

374
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,922
<i>Chaplain at Attica said Pastor Randy</i>

375
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,259
<i>had been down the habit road himself,</i>

376
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,885
<i>so he'd help me.</i>

377
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,596
Curfew is 9:00 on weekdays,
10:00 on weekends.

378
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,771
I've been there, dude.

379
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,316
If you want to rap,
my door is always open.

380
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,235
I like to rap. You'll
find me very friendly.

381
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,607
Just come in any time. Any time at all.

382
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm just Randy, man.

383
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,369
<i>Daniel was really encouraging</i>

384
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,196
<i>about my self-improvement.</i>

385
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,498
<i>- And I needed a friend.
- Oh!</i>

386
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,704
<i>Hadn't really had</i> a <i>friend since Ma died.</i>

387
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,455
What do you think,
you want to go get a beer?

388
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,878
I'm sober.

389
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,334
That's a good thing.

390
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,415
"A beer" is only an expression.
Let's go get something to drink,

391
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,045
- hang out.
- Okay.

392
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,016
<i>Make some noise
for the great Sorina Luminita!</i>

393
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,396
<i>This is Solid Gold, Miami.</i>

394
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,322
Hey, is that breast milk?

395
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,080
- What?
- Is that breast milk?

396
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,461
- Why would that be breast milk?
- 'Cause this is.

397
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,788
Listen. You take this,

398
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,249
you put it in there
and you got the real HGH.

399
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,675
I'm talking about a steroid shake!

400
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,218
I got this pregnant chick I buy it from.

401
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,385
She real clean, too.

402
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,678
- No.
- No, no, no, for real.

403
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,971
She just got her tests and everything.

404
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,266
<i>Oh, my.“ You ever suck
a pregnant woman Riﬂe'?</i>

405
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,765
Oh, my God!
This is so good! Come on, try some.

406
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,813
It'll make you great, man!

407
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,016
You already big,
but you could be bigger, you know?

408
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,272
I'm big! I'ma be swelled, though.

409
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,024
Walk sideways through doors.

410
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,855
You want some?
We could be tittie brothers.

411
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,190
Yeah!

412
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,444
I'm going to go with "no."

413
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,197
- Excuse me.
- What you...

414
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,652
Now I'm the guy at the bar?

415
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,112
Fine, keep my breast milk to myself.

416
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,744
Hey, Paul? What do you think of Sorina?

417
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,662
Wow, she's... Exactly.
She's perfect!

418
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,167
And we thought
we were gonna have to cast in London.

419
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,630
Please, tell me again
about this movie you're making.

420
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,383
No, it's not a movie, baby,
it's a music video.

421
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,805
But big budget. Sets, cars, Eiffel Tower.

422
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,881
It's going to be amazing.

423
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,717
Tell Sorina about the song, Paul.

424
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,681
She's very excited.

425
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,809
Enrique is our... ls our lead singer.

426
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,687
And he falls in love
with a beautiful woman.

427
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,067
- Me?
- You're the leading lady!

428
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,239
Yes, of course!

429
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,408
And he follows
this beautiful woman, you,

430
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,702
<i>all the way to London.</i>

431
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,495
<i>It all started in Transylvania.</i>

432
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,747
<i>I was Miss Bucharest.</i>

433
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,076
<i>Ludimila Draganesti is a whore!</i>

434
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,003
<i>She show her vageena
to the stupid judge.</i>

435
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,503
<i>I knew the only place
a woman like me could be appreciated</i>

436
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,508
<i>was in United States.</i>

437
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,009
<i>After all, it was the land of opportunity.</i>

438
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,089
USA.

439
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,425
- Good bye!
- I saw Pretty Woman.

440
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,426
<i>All Julia Roberts had to do</i>

441
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,557
<i>was show Richard Gere her pvsda</i>

442
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,560
<i>and she got a shopping trip
to Beverly Hills.</i>

443
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,191
<i>My msda was so much nicer than hers.</i>

444
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,352
<i>Then I met Daniel.</i>

445
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,734
<i>He had that can-do spirit.</i>

446
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,861
Yes! Bang me harder!

447
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,283
The car...

448
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,286
<i>My American dream
was finally coming true.</i>

449
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,037
That was great!

450
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,665
You can't just kidnap a guy
and take his things!

451
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,838
You can't do that. That's so illegal.

452
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,462
Yes, we can.
We're do-ers. Do-ers do.

453
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,884
I can't do right now.
I just got out of prison.

454
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,302
That's fear, Paul.

455
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,554
- All right. Good night, babe!
- Bye.

456
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,177
Do you know what fear is?

457
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,137
False Evidence Appearing Real?

458
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,469
That's a Jonny Wu line!

459
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,053
False Evidence Appearing Real.

460
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,137
You know Jonny Wu, too?

461
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,189
I don't know anything
about an Asian guy.

462
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,356
That's an AA line.

463
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,106
AA started in 1935, Akron, Ohio.

464
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,983
And I want no part of this.
You're on your own.

465
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,689
- We're gonna do this. Yeah.
- We're not gonna...

466
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,649
- You're gonna do this with us.
- I'm not.

467
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,779
It's gonna be fun.

468
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,074
You sure know how to pick 'em, DL.

469
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,490
Dude's a freak of fucking nature.

470
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,495
Ought to put a fence around him.

471
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,535
<i>I'd do anything for Danny Lugo.</i>

472
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,961
<i>He was my boy.</i>

473
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,001
<i>As good to me as anyone ever was.</i>

474
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,582
<i>He was a big-hearted motherfucker</i>

475
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,088
<i>who I knew only had my best in mind.</i>

476
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,794
<i>But the shit he was poppin'?</i>

477
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,175
<i>This daffy plot he had percolating?</i>

478
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,636
<i>I'd never been a crimer.</i>

479
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,764
<i>Ain't never had a reason to be.</i>

480
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,063
Come on!

481
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,813
<i>Goddamn! My shit stopped working.</i>

482
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,312
<i>Then all of a sudden, I had a reason.</i>

483
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,278
Mr. Doorbal,
are you currently using steroids?

484
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,529
No, ma'am.

485
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,949
Really? When's
the last time you injected?

486
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,906
Uh, Monday?

487
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,955
Yesterday. Okay. Um...

488
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,621
I'm just going to put down "using."

489
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,044
I threw them all out.

490
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,218
I think they messed me up.

491
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,879
Hmm. It's okay.

492
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,557
You probably just
have Defeated Phallus Syndrome.

493
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,009
We, like, treat it here all the time.

494
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,894
But don't worry, we can change all that.

495
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,392
It's what we specialize in here.

496
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,473
Penis magic.

497
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,226
Aw.

498
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,563
It took a lot of balls to come in here.

499
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,281
More like Raisinets.

500
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,451
At least yours are
chocolate-covered Raisinets.

501
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,153
Eh? Uh... Oh.

502
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,246
Sorry. It's just I find nothing sexier

503
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,790
than a big black man in tears.

504
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,543
I love me some rain on the African plain.

505
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,499
I hope your girlfriend
knows just how lucky she is.

506
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,506
She would know if she existed,

507
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,845
but she doesn't exist, so...

508
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,261
I guess she don't know.

509
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,808
Whoa.

510
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,766
I just got a flash
of us together on a water slide.

511
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,063
It's a steroid-induced impotence.

512
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,941
But with a shot of an engorgital

513
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,317
right into your penis,

514
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,110
you will return to those

515
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,911
beautiful, robust erections
of your high school days.

516
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,822
You do remember
your high school days, don't you?

517
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,327
Hell, yeah!

518
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,706
I used to have
a nickname for my di... I mean, penis.

519
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,330
I used to call him Ernesto.

520
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,374
I used to call my vag Michelle. What?

521
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,880
Just leave it up to me and

522
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,214
I'll have Ernesto up
in high gear in no time.

523
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,636
Those injections expensive, Doctor?

524
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,926
They come with a price.

525
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,682
<i>"PAUL". I was trying so hard to be good.</i>

526
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,735
<i>But there was so much
temptation in Miami.</i>

527
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,901
You should take a break.

528
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,734
Oh, thanks, Father.

529
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,740
This Miami heat is really crazy.

530
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,000
Wow, the way your sweat's
glistening off your muscles...

531
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,248
<i>You know, Jesus</i> said,

532
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,088
"Come to me, all who are weary,"

533
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,253
"and I will give you rest."

534
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,585
I can give you rest, Paul.

535
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,430
You're so buff.

536
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,099
<i>Why was he telling me I was buff?</i>

537
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,264
Hey, buddy!

538
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:12,845
Thanks for coming.

539
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,436
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

540
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,899
Things aren't working out too good
at the church.

541
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,899
<i>"PAUL". {just snapped.</i>

542
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,864
- I almost killed him.
- Don't sweat that, Paul.

543
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,786
We go through with this,
nobody gets hurt, right?

544
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,535
Physically hurt? No, man!

545
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,365
This is a straight-up kidnapping,
that's all!

546
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,701
It's like a snatch-and-grab.

547
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,203
Very simple.
We snatch him, we grab him,

548
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,708
he signs a few signatures,

549
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,540
we give him a protein shake
and we show him the door.

550
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,045
He doesn't even know what happened!

551
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,718
He thinks he made a deal!

552
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,794
- Right?
- Huh.

553
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,426
Listen. I watch a lot of movies, Paul.

554
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,677
I know what I'm doing.

555
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,354
This is the shit, man!

556
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,148
Adrian, put those down, will you?

557
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,984
Sorry, gentlemen. Police use only.

558
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,277
Tampa PD, brother. It's okay.

559
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,871
In that case, I need to see badges.

560
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,418
We're, uh, retired. Off the, uh...

561
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,999
Off the job.

562
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,050
And now we're doing security for a, um...

563
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,549
For a rock group called, uh, Stryper,

564
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,757
- I don't know if you've heard...
- Oh, I've heard...

565
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,183
<i>Never again will an oppressor</i>

566
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,181
<i>"BOTH". Overrun my people!</i>

567
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,396
<i>For now I'm keeping watch!</i>

568
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,812
- That's the gospel, yeah!

569
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,144
And people say Christian rock sucks.

570
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,150
Who says that?

571
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:47,815
Yeah, who?

572
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,822
Nobody. I mean, well,
fucking assholes do.

573
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,411
Huh. Oh...

574
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,240
You know, I, uh,
I actually thought that Stryper broke up.

575
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,292
They're actually having a reunion tour

576
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,745
in Jerusalem.

577
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,961
Ooh!

578
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,664
And they need extra security.

579
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,047
Look, we wish
we didn't have to go there, but, uh,

580
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,965
but <i>as</i> you know,

581
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,671
it's not the world we live in now, brother.

582
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,761
So true. Hmm.

583
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,106
So, what can I do you for?

584
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,897
We're looking for merchandise
to shock, incapacitate

585
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,354
and imprison our fellow man.

586
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,648
Okay, seriously,
you're gonna love this, all right?

587
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,573
I've done it before,
so come on. Just hit me.

588
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,152
Come on, just hit me, hit me!
Come on, do it!

589
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,158
Hit me! Hit me!

590
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,049
<i>That moment,</i>

591
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,842
<i>I knew I assembled the right crew.</i>

592
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,464
<i>Doyle and Doorbal,</i>

593
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,429
<i>stone-cold ballers from the old school.</i>

594
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,506
<i>Now, test phase.</i>

595
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,968
The best way
to do a human extraction like this,

596
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,686
in a location like this,
would be through the water,

597
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,934
but we don't have a boat,
so we're going in by land.

598
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,349
We're gonna hit the bushes

599
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,651
and get to blue point two
within five seconds.

600
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,728
Here we get a clear view
of our entry point.

601
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,688
<i>"PAUL". Danny was a mastermind!</i>

602
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,318
We hit him in the house
as soon as possible,

603
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,983
bring him out
right through the front door,

604
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,613
through the bushes and back to the van.

605
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,196
Delta Force could do a mission
like this in probably 53 seconds.

606
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,451
But with our athletic superiority,

607
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,658
we should be able to do it
in about 40. All right?

608
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,867
One problem. He's got a live-in maid,

609
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,078
so if she's there,
we knock her out on the way out.

610
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,334
<i>I knew Danny was
making most of this shit up.</i>

611
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,041
<i>But it didn't matter.
We were going to be fucking rich.</i>

612
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,852
Back!

613
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,067
He's having Shabbat!

614
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,819
Oh, shit. Go, go, go, go, go!

615
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,157
Mission abort! Mission abort!

616
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,701
We're gonna get caught!
We're gonna get caught!

617
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,074
Mission abort!
Mission abort! Mission abort!

618
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,281
I don't want to go back to prison!

619
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,582
Block him in.

620
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,160
Gotta jump off the back,
we snatch him.

621
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,588
<i>I honestly don't know
how he figures this stuff out.</i>

622
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,756
Here. Ninja.
That's your suit right there.

623
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,878
- Green bug.
- No, man.

624
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,126
Are you serious?

625
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,679
- Yeah.
- How does he get to be a ninja?

626
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,767
Eagle is on the move.

627
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,770
He's carrying a big bag of charcoal.
White shorts.

628
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,018
<i>He's coming to us.</i>

629
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,940
Prepare to neutralize the target.

630

Come on, come on, come on.

631
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,772
Shit, he's coming, he's coming!

632
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,024
Come on, come on, come on!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

633
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,868
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get him! Get him! Get him!

634
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,543
What the hell?

635
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,288
Ass wipe!

636
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,170
- Did you get him?
- Prick.

637
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,466
- Where is he?
- Fucking maniac.

638
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,010
What the fuck?
He was right here!

639
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,550
Where'd he go? You see him?

640
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,717
Where the hell is he?
You've got to be fucking kidding me!

641
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,392
- There he is!
- Fuck!

642
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,223
You got the wrong BMW?

643
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,974
It's two exact BMW's!

644
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,025
I told you to check the license plate!

645
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,102
It was an honest mistake!

646
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,779
Yo, we thought it was the same car.
It looks exactly the same.

647
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,074
I told you, M98305 "Miami Bitch"!

648
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,150
Is that too hard?

649
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,327
- It was an honest...
- Fuck that!

650
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,369
Fuck you!

651

I can deal with his impotence,

652
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,665
I cannot deal with your incompetence!
What the fuck?

653
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,626
You were a bit of
a disappointment today.

654
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,831
You're reassigned to Eagle's Nest.

655
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,583
Tomorrow we get our prize.

Look at yourselves! You handle food.

00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,731
What are we talking here, herpes?

661
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,231
Don't they feed you at home,
chunky trunks, huh?

662
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,486
Yeah.

663
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,115
And can we stick a smidge of pastrami
in the sandwiches, just for the novelty?

664

Fucking Pimple and Blimpie here.

What is this about?
Who the fuck are you?

667

Do these tasers rock or what?

668

Hey.

00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,772
- What do you want?
- You gonna call home.

670
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,316
You gonna tell your baby mamacita

671
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,361
she gonna take the kid and go
home to Colombia, immediately!

672
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,360
And she tells no one.
Especially la policia.

673
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,648
Because if she does,

674
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,358
that's a big fucking
problem for you, man.

<i>She's at her tennis lesson.</i>

She's not there! She's not home!

679

Tell her to get her,

You knocked him out, man!

681
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,211
What the fuck did you do that for?

682
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,382
- Put the fucking thing away!
- Okay, okay.

683
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,550
I need to read the manual.

You don't fucking need it anymore.

Here. You take it.

Roger that, Patriot One. Uh...

690
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,486
Didn't you say that
your friend kept athletic supplies

691
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,904

692

<i>Over. What's the issue?</i>

694
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,162
I'm looking at a lot

A lot.

Oh, such a fucking moron!

<i>Répido!</i>

<i>My grandfather ﬂed Germany in 1943.</i>

<i>I put up with shit

<i>they don't know Victor Pepe Kershaw.</i>

722
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,833
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell is going on here?

723
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,378
I struggle, Vic. I wake up each day

724
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,252
and I try to live
a life dedicated to self-improvement.

725
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,884
To finding a personal path
that allows me

726
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,632
to employ my special gifts.

727
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,258
Like tying guys to chairs

728
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,089
and sticking pliers up their nose?

729
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,765
You shut your mouth
while the man's talking!

730
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,728
You got to be quiet,
Victor. Like a mouse.

731
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,809
I see guys like you my whole life.

732
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,486
You roll into this country, and America,
she just spreads her pretty cheeks.

733
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,690
Meantime, native sons
born of the red, white and blue

734
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,864
are left broken,
snuffling for your crumbs!

735
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,786
You're broke, you dumb shit,

736
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,542
because you never went to college.

737
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,041
Thereby guaranteeing

738
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,717
you were going to spend
the rest of your life

739
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,215
obsessing over pectoral muscles.

740
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,721
Why'd you say that?

741
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,478
Why'd you say that, you piece of shit,

742
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,484
about pectoral muscles?

743
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,034
Fucking tell me now!

744
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,702
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

745
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,450
What's going on is
this dude seems to think

746
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,327
he knows who the fuck I am!

747
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,658
No, I don't, I don't.

748
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,914
Tell me why the fuck you said that!

749
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,795
Well, you're going to fucking tell me!

750
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,998
You're going to fucking tell me now!

751
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,754
No, I don't... I don't know.

752
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,591
- Come on, man.
- Fuck that.

753
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,801
- Tell me.
- No!

754
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,391
I don't know
if you realize this, Victor,

755
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,434
but you're not going
anywhere anytime soon.

756
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,221
You're going to tell me.
Get him up! Now!

757
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,931
- Get him up!

758
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,610
Your cologne, Danny.

759
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,611
Your stinky, awful, vanilla,
disgusting cologne.

760
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,537
<i>As soon as I said it,
I knew I'd sealed my fate.</i>

761
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,616
<i>My goddamn half-Colombian,
half-Jew temper.</i>

762
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:45,295
Killing me is not going to
give you job skills, Danny.

763
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,588
I don't just want everything you have.

764
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,803
I want you

765
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,972
not to have it.

766
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,936
What are we gonna do now?

767
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,058
What do you mean,
"What are we gonna do?"

768
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,314
We're doing it.

769
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,650
Everything's under control.
You better fucking man up.

770
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,823
We're gonna make some phone calls.

771
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,366
You hear me, Victor?

772
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,949

I'm fine.
I just banged my shin.

788
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,116
Take the kid to your parents

789
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,826
until I can get this worked out.

790
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,788
And not a word to the police,
baby, okay?

791
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:10,918
Not one word.

792
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,999
I don't need a secretary anymore.

793
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,380
Okay, you're fired!

794
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,965
There's some complex engineering
in these things.

795
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,387
No necesita...
You know, to clean la casa.

796
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,139
Jack... It's very simple.

797
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,768
I've fallen in love with a younger woman

798
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,814
and we're relocating to San Juan.

799
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,891
I know...

800
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,398
Okay, take care.

801
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,483
All right, we're good here.

802
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,155
Patriot Two, you got first watch.

803
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,574
First watch?

804
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,154
Uh-huh.

805
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,657
- I got to watch him?
- Yeah.

806
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,034
- We're gonna be alone?
- We're gonna rotate.

807
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,996
I got to go to work!
We got to keep up appearances.

808
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,292
What do you want me to do?

809
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,665
Keep an eye on him.

810
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,623
- He's crying!
- That's okay, he'll stop.

811
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,887
Late three times in a row.

812
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,306
Tiffany, did my 11:00 call?
Mr. Kershaw?

813
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,724
He didn't call, Mr. Lugo.

814
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,767
You know, call me crazy.

815
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,187
I don't know... My body's top priority.

816
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,147
<i>Everything was falling into place.</i>

817
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,483
Anybody here?

818
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,359
I need a drink!

819
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,157
Somebody?

820
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,159
I need a drink!

821
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,444
Urn... Somebody!

822
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,116
Uh...

823
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,207
We don't keep spirits here.

824
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,789
And I'm sober.

825
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,836
No shit!

826
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,296
- Me, too.
- You are?

827
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,213
So cool. Praise Jesus!

828
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,721
Got my chip and everything.
That was a proud moment.

829
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,552
You should be proud.
There you go.

830
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,689
You know, when I was in prison,

831
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,392
I was clean for nearly a year.

832
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,567
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

833
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,317
But a week before I got sprung,
I had a little pruno slip.

834
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,023
- Huh?
- Pruno is prison wine.

835
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,325
I made the best pruno in the yard.

836
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,160
You know what?

837
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,410
Maybe the real reason I'm here

838
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,490
is to help you

839
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,919
get through another day sober.

840
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:20,006
- That's heavy.
- It really is. I know.

841
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,174
It truly is.

842
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:27,475
I'm sorry about all this. Everything.

843
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,145
Oh, no, no. It's okay.
Shit happens. Forget it.

844
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,515
But really,

845
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,855
maybe I was sent <i>as</i> a reminder.

846
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,564
Do you believe in that stuff?
Higher power stuff?

847
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,115
I live it.

848
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,617
Okay...

849
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,038
You think I could get another one
of those Taco Supremes?

850
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,782
Yeah...

851
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,294
Sure. There you go. We'll switch.

852
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,040
Mmm.

853
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,551
Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.

854
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,094
- They're even better cold.

855
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,255
- You must be so hungry.
- Mmm.

856
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,216
You are so much nicer
than the other two.

857
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,973
Ah, they're sweet guys.

858
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,395
You just don't know them yet.

859
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,642
But thank you for the compliment.

860
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,725
See, the simple fact
that you are defending them

861
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,561
suggests that
you are nicer than they are.

862
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,609
I'm just saying.

863
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,111
You're a Jew, right?

864
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,125
Yes, I am.

865
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,127
Half-Jew.

866
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,246
You have a problem with that?

867
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,836
I think I can help you.

868
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,592
That would be great!

869
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,420
That would be great.

870
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,257
How? I mean, how so?

871
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,440
Victor, do you accept Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

872
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:07,942
Victor?

873
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,112
I do.

874
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,698
That felt great.

875
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,997
How did you do that?

876
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,003
I have a gift.

877
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,006
It's a gift.

878
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,637
You're good.

879
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,649
Busy day!

880
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,821
- Wake him up.
- Get up!

881
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,572
Oh, yeah... Look at that...

882
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,948
Get some paper towels, damn it!

883
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,029
- Yeah.
- Shit!

884
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,079
If there's pee on the policy,

885
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,702
they'll think
he's incontinental and flag it!

886
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,249
Shit!

887
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,920
It's not "incontinental,"
you moron. It's "incontinent."

888
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,424
You really are
a brilliant criminal mind, Lugo.

889
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,044
Well, I'm smart enough
not to be the one cuffed to a couch,

890
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,628
about to get cleaned the fuck out.

891
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,680
This one's gonna require
your signature. Bing!

892
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,475
No fucking way.

893
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,770
I know you can't see me, Victor,

894
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,891
but I have a look
of suspicion on my face.

895
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,351
What's there to be suspicious about?

896
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,024
I would like to call you Eldad.

897
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,195
In Hebrew, it means
"Beloved of God."

898
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,161
Would that be okay, my friend?

899
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,243
I would be honored, Victor.

900
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,995
<i>"PAUL". Pepe was my second friend.</i>

901
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,832
It's my shift, bro. Go home.

902
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,538
Go to church or whatever you do.

903
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,627
It's my torture chamber now.

904
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,792
<i>Doyle was taking
extra shifts with Kershaw.</i>

905
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,798
<i>And, yes, it was getting my attention.</i>

906
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,216
Sorina, you home?

907
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,470
What the hell are you doing?

908
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,843
Trying to see who you really are.

909
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,812
A big music video director

910
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,515
does not need
these glasses that see in the dark!

911
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,396
I don't want you going through my stuff.

912
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,476
Okay? These are not toys.

913
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,983
Big director driving your pussy-ass Fiero

914
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,439
with the Scooby-Doo seats!

915
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,490
I need you to sit down right now
and listen very carefully.

916
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,113
You know where I've been all day?

917
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,990
I've been at headquarters
in Langley, Virginia.

918
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,618
I haven't been truthful with you,
and, believe me, it hurts.

919
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,328
You have got to understand my work.

920
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,835
I'm in the CIA.

921
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,456
Now, good men have died
to keep what I just told you a secret.

922
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,926
CIA? Like the CIA-police CIA?

923
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,257
Those goggles,
they're government issue,

924
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,679
and, I guess in a way, so am I.

925
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,927
CIA, Daniel?

926
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,805
- That is so hot!
- No, no, no, no, no.

927
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,681
It's better you hear it all.

928
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,016
L...

929
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,193
I mean, I've seen things, okay?
Done things.

930
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,479
One time in Hong Kong,
I had to live for a week in a tree.

931
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,027
No food, no bathroom, no nothing.

932
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,451
You poor, poor baby! I am so sorry!

933
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,037
Do you know, this is the real reason
I approached you.

934
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,614
- Me?
- Yes.

935
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,244
You think you can handle
being an operative?

936
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,043
Oh, my God, Daniel, yes!
I'll do anything!

937
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,210
You know my associate, Paul?

938
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,708
- The big guy?
- Yeah, the weird guy?

939
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,084
Yeah. You're gonna
have to work close with him.

940
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,213
This is my adopted country.
I'll die for it.

941
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,005
Daniel, did you ever catch a spy girl?

942
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,595
And then maybe
you have to be spanking her.

943
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,261
Yeah, and calling her dirty,

944
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,397
Commie-sucking whore.

945
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,524
Whatever it takes.

946
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,730
"...which has been trading
on the NYSE since 1972."

947
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,990
NYSE?

948
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,025
New York Stock Exchange.

949
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,118
Oh. I'm from New York.

950
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,743
All right, next...

951
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,167
I can read to you about the Unabomber.

952
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,044
Scary.

953
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,844
Oh!

954
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,597
Damn it! Why'd you make me
do that to you, Victor?

955
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,516
I have responsibilities!

956
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,600
Jesus Christ Himself
has blessed me with many gifts!

957
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,024
One of them is knocking
someone the fuck out!

958
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,733
Pepe, you okay?

959
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:14,860
Pepe?

960
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,489
<i>It's Eldad.</i>

961
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,537
Hello, James Bond.

962
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,043
Why so sad?

963
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,880
I had to hurt a man today.

964
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,502
- Wow.
- I didn't want to,

965
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,208
'cause I like him.

966
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,001
But he forced me to.

967
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,548
Look, in your line of work,
people do get hurt.

968
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,634
- Okay.
- Danny tells me I'm with you now.

969
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,595
We work together, we play together.

970
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:46,975
For king and country.

971
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,478
Playing together sounds good.

972
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,025
Very good.

973
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,898
I still have no idea
what you're talking about right now.

974
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,820
Oh, it's okay. I know who you are.

975
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,315
Well, you should, 'cause we've met.

976
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,904
Tell me about the playing again?

977
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,612
I woke up this morning
in a state of excitement,

978
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,038
lap dancing the day away.

979
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,740
<i>"PAUL". It's like the Bible says...</i>

980
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,326
<i>You give and you get back
a hundredfold.</i>

981
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,707
<i>And then some greasy pudge-bunny</i>

982
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,288
<i>comes and takes it all away.</i>

983
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,799
Me and the lady
were having a conversation.

984
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,342
You should never wear yellow, pal.

985
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,341
Little kids might think you're
a school bus and climb on for a ride.

986
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,763
<i>"PAUL". His name was Frank Griga</i>

987
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,432
<i>and he was the third richest man
in Golden Beach.</i>

988
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,185
<i>I didn't know any of that then.</i>

989
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,683
<i>All I knew was that he was a douche.</i>

990
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,565
<i>We were three</i> weeks <i>in
and Victor wasn't breaking.</i>

991
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,312
- You got a racing dog, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

992
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,698
Hey! So, Mr. Kershaw
sold you Tasty Reuben?

993
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,531
Yep. Tasty Reuben's all mine now.

994
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,119
Let's try something new.

995
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,698
This one, I think,
is gonna be a fan favorite.

996
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,376
- You ready to sign now?
- No!

997
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,954
<i>The guy was fierce.</i>

998
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,174
Ha! Come on, come on!
Hey, baby!

999
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,842
Where did you get that dog?

1000
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,052
I got somebody here
that wants to meet you!

1001
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,845
Oh, my God, I love him!

1002
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,639
Lugo, you can get my life,

1003
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,387
but you can't have my shit!

1004
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,013
All I wanted was a little effort, baby.

1005
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,219
Eat me, Doogie.

1006
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,846
<i>He never worked this hard in the gym.</i>

1007
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,561
<i>But I did. I break guys for a living.</i>

1008
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,483
- Are you ready to sign now?
- Fuck you!

1009
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,650
Take him around again.

1010
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,272
I hate you.

1011
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,439
Thanks, buddy.

1012
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,157
Mmm-hmm.

1013
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,656
Good. Good. Hmm.

1014
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,824
Uh-oh.

1015
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,081
Is... Is there a problem?

1016
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,203
No, there shouldn't be a problem.

1017
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,250
It's just that
all of these transfer documents,

1018
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,328
they need to be witnessed
by a notary public.

1019
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,294
Well, can't you do that?

1020
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:38,715
We'd be delighted.

1021
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,714
We just need you and Mr. Kershaw

1022
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,387
to sign the documents
in the presence of our notary.

1023
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,682
But Mr. Kershaw is overseas
in Europe saving elephants.

1024
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,386
So, you can just... It's okay.

1025
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,431
Well, around here,
we call that a problem.

1026
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,855
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1027
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,062
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1028
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,152
Put it in the trash,
with the rest of my dreams.

1029
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,408
No contest, John?

1030
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,285
Lost the sponsor. Chapter 11.

1031
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,616
I told you
Amino Tropical Blast's benefits

1032
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:12,791
were totally undocumented.

1033
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,869
Can I see you in the office
for a minute, John?

1034
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,249
You're still a notary, aren't you?

1035
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,921
Yeah. Technically, I guess. Why?

1036
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,707
Well, I was hoping
you could transfer some property.

1037
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,167
I made a deal with a friend of mine.

1038
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,797
Just bring him by tomorrow.

1039
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,971
Look, my friend,
he cannot come back, okay?

1040
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,137
This is a very unique situation.

1041
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,511
He's out there trying
to impact the world in a positive way.

1042
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,309
No, that's the only reason for a notary,

1043
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,887
is that I have to
witness the signing of the document.

1044
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,348
Otherwise, somebody
could just come in off the street,

1045
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:38,184
forge somebody's signature
and take all their shit.

1046
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,314
You know, I got a stamp.

1047
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,565
Can I borrow it?

1048
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,275
No, you can't borrow my stamp.
That's sacred.

1049
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,324
What the fuck are notaries, man?

1050
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,746
We're officers of the law.

1051
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,995
Remember this chick?
Shelley? Used to work here?

1052
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,452
Black chick? I fucked her.

1053
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,329
Big slut.

1054
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,459
- Oh, John?
- Yeah.

1055
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,290
You know, I, um,

1056
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,046
I might have found
a sponsor for your competition.

1057
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,422
You ever heard of Schlotzsky's?

1058
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,213
The signature's a little off here,
but no big deal.

1059
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,761
All right, down, down, down! Just...
There, there, there!

1060
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,311
Love it!

1061
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,772
<i>Finger one,
find somebody with money. Check.</i>

1062
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,408
<i>Finger two,
make him give you everything he owns.</i>

1063
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,281
<i>Three million dollar house,</i>

1064
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,613
<i>500,000 cash. Check.</i>

1065
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,990
<i>Finger three,
make America a better place.</i>

1066
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,244
<i>You said no violence.</i>

1067
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,624
No bad violence!

1068
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,501
I know! Okay?

1069
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,675
And I meant it when I said it,
I swear to God.

1070
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,424
All right?
But this guy, he knows who I am.

1071
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,221
He could ID me.

1072
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,923
All right? That's gonna lead them to you.

1073
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,849
I cannot kill.

1074
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,017
Duly noted. All right?

1075
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,141
But if you had to do it, you would adapt.

1076
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,517
You would reach down deep, right?

1077
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,643
What do you mean, "reach down deep"?

1078
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,565
What if I reach down
and there's nothing there?

1079
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,235
Then we give you bus money
and you're off the team.

1080
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,982
That's harsh. I want to be on the team.

1081
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,233
I want you to be on the team. Okay?

1082
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,819
And the Good Lord wants you to be rich!

1083
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,992
All right? But he could put us all away.

1084
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,573
He saw us, big guy. He saw you.

1085
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:16,782
Do you want to go back?

1086
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,208
I'm not gonna let him do that to you.

1087
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,752
I'm not gonna let that happen to you.

1088
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,295
You're not going back!

1089
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,127
Look, when this is over,
we'll all go camping.

1090
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,423
- All right?
- Okay.

1091
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,876
And, meanwhile,

1092
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,886
make him comfy, all right?
Just get him drunk.

1093
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,973
I can't do that.

1094
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,592
Why?

1095
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,476
Pepe is sober.

1096
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,516
Do me a favor, okay?

1097
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,815
Don't call him Pepe
like you were in the sixth grade together.

1098
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,526
Hey.

1099
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,566
Are we alone?

1100
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,031
- Yeah.

1101
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,242
Would you...

1102
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,697
Would you help me... Help me escape?

1103
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:57,619
You need money.

1104
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,793
I've got money. You can have it all.

1105
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,045
- Everything.
- Victor, Victor.

1106
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,083
I don't want to die, Eldad. Not now.

1107
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,173
My son...

1108
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,091
Look, Victor. Victor.

1109
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,297
This will all be over very soon.

1110
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,350
We're gonna get you on a plane tonight.

1111
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,806
We know someone at the airport

1112
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,387
who's gonna get you
out of the country tonight,

1113
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,892
but the only way he's gonna do it

1114
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,689
is if you're knee-walking drunk.

1115
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,481
You won't remember his face.
You have to.

1116
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,815
You're going to need a drink if I die,

1117
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,400
you half-a-retard!

1118
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,153
And when I get to heaven,

1119
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,909
I'm going to tell Jesus what you did.

1120
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,419
You're not going to tell Jesus anything.

1121
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,414
I'm doing you a favor!

1122
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,463
I'm giving you a private jet!

1123
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,259
Whisking you out of the country!

1124
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,190
Hey, this don't look like an airport.

1125
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,027
Where's my jet?

1126
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,484
Don't worry,
you're still going home.

1127
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,034
A thousand bucks if I <i>smash</i> him

1128
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,407
- into that fucking backhoe!
- Do it.

1129
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,487
- A thousand?
- A thousand!

1130
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,541
- Drink some! Drink some!
- Hey... Son of a...

1131
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,959
Oh, my God.

1132
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,706
Hey, I have a...
Calm the fuck down.

1133
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,263
Yes!

1134
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:51,479
I fucking told you!

1135
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,703
Lucky I had an airbag.

1136
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,085
You put on his fucking seat belt?

1137
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,170
Yeah.

1138
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,416
It is the law.

1139
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,921
You don't put on a seat belt,
you'll hurt your face

1140
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,594
with the airbag.
That's what they tell you.

1141
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,296
"Buckle up. It's the law."

1142
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,722
His blood alcohol's up to his ears!

1143
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,799
Nobody would expect him to buckle up!

1144
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,806
Yeah, I concur. That was real stupid.

1145
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,637
You just made a good man suffer.

1146
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,972
This is going fucking perfect!

1147
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,102
- Perfect.
- Get the gas can now!

1148
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,105
You're siding with him?

1149
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,778
I was like the Iceman, okay?
Bull's-eye! Strike!

1150
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,438
Suckers.

1151
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,818
I'll get the gas can. I'll be alone.

1152
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,196
Hey, Pepe, it's <i>Eldad.</i> You okay?

1153
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,237
Don't do that right now, please. Don't.

1154
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,996
All good, Eldad.

1155
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,119
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1156
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,576
Hurry up.

1157
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,245
Uh-oh.

1158
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,121
Oh, shit.

1159
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,340
Paul, just run him over.

1160
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,629
Just run him over?

1161
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,257
Yeah, just start the car
and just run him over.

1162
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,426
I can't start the car
and run him over. We...

1163
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,600
Paul, your friend Pepe is on fire.

1164
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,847
He's going to die anyway.

1165
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,018
Do you want him to suffer,

1166
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,391
or you want to take him
out of his misery?

1167
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,064
You can do this, okay? Start the car,

1168
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,149
put it in gear and run him over.

1169
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,899
I don't know, DL. That's hardcore, man.

1170
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,610
Start the fucking car and go!

1171
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,502
Back over him.

1172
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,881
Get it over quick.
It's like ripping off a Band-Aid.

1173
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,011
Just do it!

1174
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,814
Don't make Pepe suffer.

1175
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,562
No!

1176
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,078
I knew you could do it, Paul.

1177
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,122
You just killed a man.

1178
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,547
We did.

1179
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,625
No, you did it.

1180
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:03,045
I just provided options.

1181
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,050
Why are you saying I did it?

1182
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,968
We did it.

1183
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,144
No, you drove.

1184
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,188
It's... It's a good thing. Tell him.

1185
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,349
You did a good thing.

1186
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,739
<i>No, this wasn't heaven.</i>

1187
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:34,043
<i>I wasn't transported
to some celestial space</i>

1188
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,212
<i>given my newfound bullshit Christianity.</i>

1189
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,085
<i>This isn't that kind of story.</i>

1190
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,666
<i>But you know how
I knew these monkeys</i>

1191
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,843
<i>were rank fucking amateurs?</i>

1192
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,717
<i>Because I was still alive.</i>

1193
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:50,427
<i>You can beat me, rob me,
hang me like dry cleaning,</i>

1194
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,977
<i>burn my fucking hair off,</i>

1195
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,770
<i>but don't tell me
you're taking me to the airport</i>

1196
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,472
<i>when really you're going to kill me.</i>

1197
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,308
<i>And if you are going to kill me,</i>

1198
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,814
<i>you damn well better do it.</i>

1199
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,566
Mmm!

1200
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,105
Hey, baby doll.

1201
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,737
Thought we almost lost you
there for a while.

1202
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,903
Okay, let me explain to you
about your face.

1203
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,571
Holy shit!

1204
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,163
I was tasered by ninjas.

1205
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,995
Is that tire tread on your forehead?

1206
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,501
Yes, for the fifteenth time, it is.

1207
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,335
They did this to me!
Drove right over my face.

1208
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,386
So, you're from Colombia originally.

1209
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,713
So what?

1210
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,933
I got run over here. In America.

1211
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,511
Not in Colombia!

1212
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,728
- I'm not sure I like your attitude, sir.

1213
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,477
Shut the hell up, Baby Huey!

1214
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,182
<i>Asshole.</i>

1215
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,688
I'm going to kill him.

1216
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,235
Nurse!

1217
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,778
Listen to me.

1218
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,028
I just lost my family, my business,

1219
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:51,487
and half of my nose.
I almost bit my tongue off.

1220
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,289
Got my bank accounts cleaned out.

1221
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,209
You think I give a rat's ass
if you don't like my attitude?

1222
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,707
We could still arrest you.

1223
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,459
Your blood alcohol
was four times the limit.

1224
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,881
Is this her first day?

1225
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,958
Just tell me if this is

1226
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,635
Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

1227
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,045
Don't you listen?

1228
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,971
They forced chocolate liqueur down me!

1229
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,634
The evil ninja weightlifters?
Those are the guys?

1230
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:17,142
You should cut
some of that fuzz out of your ears!

1231
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:20,144
Daniel Lugo. Write it down.

1232
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,442
From what I hear,
Mr. Vic "Pepe" Kershaw,

1233
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,565
they sell quite a bit
of drugs in Colombia.

1234
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,897
God, I can't believe this!

1235
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,607
I'm having some trouble with it myself.

1236
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,237
You say you were bound, abused

1237
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,911
and roughed up by
a group of bodybuilders.

1238
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,784
Was this a sex thing?

1239
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,156
What?

1240
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,752
One very large burnt dildo,

1241
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,082
baseball-sized anal beads found
in the back of your car.

1242
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,462
Not normal stuff.

1243
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,793
We're finding it hard to believe

1244
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:49,753
that no one reported you missing.

1245
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,680
Not one single person.

1246
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,509
This could be a wake-up call, buddy.

1247
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,104
Wait a second. Is that all I get?

1248
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,146
Get back here!

1249
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,020
- I don't believe a word he said.
- Mmm-mmm.

1250
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,773
<i>We stack-loaded 3,000 protein calories.</i>

1251
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,233
<i>Looking tough, feeling tough.</i>

1252
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,200
<i>We were going to rock it.
We didn't find Kershaw's obit.</i>

1253
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,206
<i>We found him alive, at the hospital.</i>

1254
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,708
<i>So we had some unfinished business.</i>

1255
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,966
Oh! I'm not going to make it.
I'm not going to make it...

1256
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,467
Can you keep him quiet?

1257
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,348
- On, Christ.

1258
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,019
<i>"ED". Being a cop for so long,</i>

1259
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,318
<i>I've learned that
people's lives are usually linear.</i>

1260
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,394
<i>Until they're not.</i>

1261
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,107
<i>Comes</i> a <i>day
for just about everyone when A</i>

1262
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,784
<i>suddenly skips B
and careens to polka-dot weird W.</i>

1263
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,867
<i>Best move I ever made
was marrying Cissy.</i>

1264
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,823
Sweetie pie, are you deaf?

1265
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,749
- The phone has rung, like, 19 times.

1266
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,326
Twenty.

1267
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,832
Sorry, babe, I didn't hear it.

1268
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,083
<i>After I retired,</i>

1269
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:09,133
<i>I reopened the detective agency
my old man used to own.</i>

1270
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,709
<i>But after a few years,</i>

1271
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,386
<i>Cissy begged me to retire from that, too.</i>

1272
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,759
<i>She said Pd earned my relaxing years</i>

1273
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,139
<i>with long, lazy days
full of golf and fishing.</i>

1274
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,312
<i>Except the only thing
I hate more than golf is fishing.</i>

1275
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,060
Du Bois Investigators, Inc.

1276
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,517
Is this Ed Du Bois the Second?

1277
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,022
Actually, it's Ed the Third.

1278
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,603
<i>I want Ed the Second.</i>

1279
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,111
He's dead. And I'm retired.

1280
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,316
<i>I'm guessing you're looking at</i>

1281
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,867
<i>a hell of an old yellow pages, buddy.</i>

1282
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:38,741
Everything's old in this frickin' hospital.

1283
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,864
It just shot out of my ass!

1284
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,574
- I couldn't help it.
- Oh!

1285
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,831
Oh, God.
He should be ejected from this facility!

1286
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:49,961
Oh, my God... Not you.
I need your help.

1287
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,792
<i>I'm a desperate man.</i>

1288
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,297
What did you say your name was?

1289
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,472
<i>The team explored
a number of infiltration procedures.</i>

1290
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,474
<i>Adrian even offered to stage</i>

1291
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,555
<i>a diversionary fistfight in the hall.</i>

1292
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,391
<i>We decided against that.</i>

1293
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,481
But I can't say that
what the police told you

1294
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,608
is far from my own analysis.

1295
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,064
I have to entertain

1296
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,149
the possibility that you might be lying.

1297
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,656
<i>There was one major problem.</i>

1298
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,703
<i>This fucking archaic
line-directory system</i>

1299
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,076
<i>throughout the whole entire hospital.</i>

1300
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,907
<i>It took us an hour just to find the ICU.</i>

1301
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,414
<i>Please believe me,</i>

1302
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,121
<i>it happened just the way I say it did.</i>

1303
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:32,003
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kershaw,

1304
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,584
but I can't take the case.

1305
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,385
I'm a dead man.

1306
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,176
A hospital is a very public place.

1307
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,599
<i>And anybody could gain
access to your room.</i>

1308
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,096
And if it were me, and some large men

1309
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,427
were trying to re-kill me,

1310
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,262
<i>and I wanted to stay un-dead,</i>

1311
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,814
I'd get the hell out of there. Fast.

1312
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,444
<i>In the end,</i>

1313
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,113
<i>after reviewing our past performance,</i>

1314
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,486
<i>we could come to only one conclusion.</i>

1315
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,363
<i>We're so much better when we wing it.</i>

1316
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,919
Can I help you with something?

1317
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,138
I'm Dr. Lowenstein,

1318
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,136
uh, Mr. Kershaw's
primary care physician.

1319
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,512
He didn't mention anything.

1320
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:27,016
Oh, well, I'm, uh...
I'm over at Miami General.

1321
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,557
Where is Victor?

1322
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,234
He checked himself out,
against my advice.

1323
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,316
I think the visit
from the police scared him.

1324
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,147
Police? What did they want?

1325
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,528
Oh, accident investigation.

1326
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,075
They didn't seem too thrilled

1327
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,277
by Mr. Kershaw's account of events.

1328
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,532
He claimed he'd been tortured.

1329
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,284
By bodybuilders.

1330
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,077
- Bodybuilders?
- Yes.

1331
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:54,089
This is a case of delusional
alcoholism. It's not uncommon.

1332
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,666
You know, I warned him about that.

1333
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,093
Why are you dressed for
surgery in our hospital?

1334
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,421
Well, I like to be prepared for anything.

1335
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,093
Gentlemen?

1336
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,138
Oh, shit...

1337
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,019
So, what if he goes to the cops?

1338
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,395
He already did.

1339
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,443
You know what happened? Nothing!

1340
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,270
Because they figured out
what we already know,

1341
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,573
that Victor Kershaw
is a half-criminal prick

1342
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,194
who deserved bad shit to happen to him.

1343
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,366
Yeah.

1344
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,444
I thought he had to be dead.

1345
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,112
So what?

1346
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,921
You might feel a little prick.

1347
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:45,974
Oh, yeah!

1348
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,387
It's a little less than what I'm used to,

1349
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,143
but what the heck?

1350
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,821
I'm going to rock your world.

1351
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,157
Ninja style.

1352
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,669
I told you we'd fix it
with the magic penis shots.

1353
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,172
Mmm... Oh, yeah!

1354
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,653
- No way!
- No, this is your house.

1355
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,697
- Jesus may exalt.

1356
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,158
<i>- But cocaine is king.</i>

1357
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,166
They seem very happy.

1358
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,549
Mmm-hmm. Dry humping.

1359
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,887
This is such nice,
supple leather.

1360
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,390
<i>Asshole.</i>

1361
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:19,147
<i>I know what you're looking at.
Now look at this.</i>

1362
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,695
I don't have a home, you putz!

1363
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,407
Oh, jeez!

1364
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,198
Hey, Kershaw! It's Ed Du Bois!

1365
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,752
Jesus.

1366
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,209
You thought I was lying.

1367
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,091
Sometimes it takes me a while
to make up my mind.

1368
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,593
Nice place.

1369
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,058
How'd you find me?

1370
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,635
Cab driver at the hospital.

1371
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,016
I paid him 20 not to talk.

1372
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,730
Well, I paid him 40.

1373
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,274
This shit's my new best friend.

1374
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,355
I'm gonna look into your case, Victor,

1375
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,108
but if you're not telling me the truth,

1376
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,189
you're gonna be in a lot more
trouble than when you started.

1377
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,237
So, why are you helping me?

1378
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,911
Well, what they did to you
is un-American.

1379
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,196
Real reason.

1380
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,619
Well, catching fish is fine.

1381
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,168
Catching bad guys is finer.

1382
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,836
Now, won't you tell me
your story again, hmm?

1383
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,459
From the beginning.

1384
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,544
Just give me one more
of those blue ones.

1385
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:28,719
You've had enough.

1386
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,012
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

1387
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,392
Hey, we didn't see you move in.

1388
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,314
Oh, you know,
most of my things are being shipped.

1389
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,229
What happened to the Kershaws?

1390
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,560
You know, I don't know the specifics,

1391
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,020
but they must have
really been underwater,

1392
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,696
because they practically
gave me the house.

1393
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,318
I mean, I had asked
the guy from the bank

1394
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,196
and he thinks that
the guy ran off with some girl

1395
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,777
that he met in Havana,
like one of those sex vacations.

1396
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,413
Jeez! Man, you think you know people.

1397
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,535
Yeah.

1398
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,242
Although Victor liked
to talk about sex a lot.

1399
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,451
Brad MacCalister.

1400
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,665
Torn...

1401
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,295
Lawn.

1402
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,501
- Gotcha.
- Yeah.

1403
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,924
That's a pretty
professional looking hoop

1404
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,125
- you got there.
- Yeah.

1405
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,551
Look at you,
already improving the place.

1406
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,173
Well, that's what I do.

1407
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,596
You know, I saw
your wife drop off a gang of kids,

1408
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,093
figured they could come by
anytime and shoot a round.

1409
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,469
I've done a bit of coaching, so...

1410
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,550
Hey, that sounds terrific.

1411
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,936
Use your elbows, you little pussy!

1412
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,221
Oh, tell your mama!

1413
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,227
Damn!

1414
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,025
- Sucker! Oh!

1415
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,027
What the hell
are you doing on the ground?

1416
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,321
- That hurts.
- Well, it's supposed to hurt!

1417
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:29,943
That pain's what's gonna save your life.

1418
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,115
Your cells remember where it hurts

1419
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,157
and that's where they get strong.

1420
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,280
It's called pain and gain, Rusty.

1421
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,906
Don't be a little bitch.
You gonna man up?

1422
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,112
You better,
'cause right now your sister's

1423
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,367
stronger than you.
Give me your hand. Get up!

1424
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,165
What are you looking at,
you little chubby broad'?

1425
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,833
Don't eyeball me, boy. I see your mother

1426
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,160
driving up and down the street
looking at me.

1427
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,586
I'll be your stepfather in about a week.

1428
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,462
<i>I</i> love my new home,

1429
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,757
<i>my new neighborhood
and my little brat-pack crew.</i>

1430
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,300
<i>I kept it real with them
little motherfuckers</i>

1431
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,002
<i>and they kept it real with me.</i>

1432
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,432
That's 315, close grip.

1433
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,013
All right, benching builds your pecs.

1434
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,344
We got no homos in this gang, right?

1435
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,644
All right, good.
And if you bachelors like girls,

1436
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,972
listen to the Lawn Dawg.

1437
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,773
No hottie can resist dope pecs.

1438
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,065
You want to chase tail with me
in South Beach

1439
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,393
<i>on</i> my <i>Puppy Luv?</i> Huh?

1440
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,023
Or do you want to
look at your little nuts in the mirror

1441
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,103
and see if you got any peach fuzz?

1442
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,314
All right, good.

1443
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,489
Wow!

1444
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,909
Hey, guys. You like it?

1445
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,201
Yeah.

1446
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,779
Oh, I love the sexy <i>casa!</i>

1447
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,574
You guys like that?

1448
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,120
You like that fine Russian pussy?

1449
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,167
That was mine.

1450
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,415
I gave it to him. Like nothing.

1451
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,837
Now if we're gonna roll,
we're gonna chase tail,

1452
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,635
we got to do it my way, okay?

1453
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,338
No pickle-licking around here. Let's go.

1454
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,547
Break it off. Remind your folks

1455
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:37,757
about Neighborhood Watch, okay?

1456
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,888
You, you, you and you, jog it home.

1457
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,720
- All right, big man.
- All right, brother.

1458
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:42,804
Let's race the Porsche, baby.

1459
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,472
- Let's do it.
- Come on. It's money.

1460
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,276
You get the Turbo.

1461
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,032
And this Adrian Doorbal,
he paid in cash?

1462
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,958
Yes. 100,000.

1463
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,414
- Cash?
- Cash.

1464
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,120
- This didn't surprise you.
- No.

1465
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,833
I thought maybe he was in sports, rap.

1466
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,041
You know, he is black.

1467
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:13,793
Yeah.

1468
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,337
Well, you don't think it was strange

1469
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,714
that Mr. Kershaw never said goodbye?

1470
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,300
He was a dick.
Always making fat jokes.

1471
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,560
One time he told me
if I can cut out snacking,

1472
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,682
that they can cure world hunger.

1473
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,805
Yeah, he can be kind of rude that way.

1474
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:27,811
What do you think of the new guy?

1475
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:31,986
Awesome. He says I'm a do-er.

1476
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,940
Our Neighborhood Watch
is about to start.

1477
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,525
Can I get everybody's attention?

1478
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,744
Would you like one? Those are so cute.

1479
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,537
They're like little edible penises.

1480
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,540
I wish they had them in the strip club.
They're great niblets.

1481
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,079
This is delicious.

1482
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,538
And so easy,
from freezer to microwave to mouth.

1483
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,338
Stan.

1484
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,469
Okay. Eyes front, neighbors.

1485
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:57,670
Now, we'd all like to believe

1486
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,222
we're safe here in
Old Cutler Cove Estates.

1487
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,516
I know I feel more snug
and secure than I've ever.

1488
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,717
And I feel very welcomed,

1489
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,677
and I want to
thank you all for that. Okay?

1490
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,729
But this is a very serious situation.

1491
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,723
Okay? There are bad guys out there

1492
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,059
that are waiting for
good people like us to drop our guard.

1493
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:12,689
Bad guys are everywhere.

1494
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,775
I should know, okay.
I work for the government.

1495
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,197
And I've been to prison.

1496
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,316
And it sucks!

1497
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,818
At this first meeting
of the Neighborhood Watch,

1498
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,324
Peter, Dick and I will demonstrate

1499
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,780
a few ways we can keep ourselves safe.

1500
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,790
- My pal, Dick...
- Yeah.

1501
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:27,913
Who works with me at the government,

1502
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,118
will now hand out
your preparedness packs.

1503
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,169
Right.

1504
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,292
That means we have to hand
out the preparedness packs,

1505
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,793
- thank you.
- Yeah. Right away.

1506
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,170
In our own corner
of the American dream,

1507
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,547
safety requires vigilance.

1508
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,428
Okay, look at our chart here.

1509
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,598
Number one thing,
vigilance equals safety.

1510
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,299
Number two, recognizing...

1511
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:47,057
Oh, baby. That's the one. Yeah.

1512
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:51,725
Okay. First thing,
recognizing a potential attacker.

1513
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,523
Sorry about that. There it is.

1514
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:56,604
Peter?

1515
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:57,946
- Safety pack.

1516
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,819
Each family gets a pack.

1517
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,493
Each pack has
pepper spray and a taser.

1518
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,990
Ladies, these things work.

1519
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,664
You can zap a guy's balls off
with one hit, all right.

1520
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,662
Okay! The lovely Sorina here...

1521
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,539
- Ta-da!
- ...ls going to be the victim.

1522
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,620
Who wants to volunteer to be a rapist?

1523
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:13,834
Oh, sure.

1524
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:14,914
Right here!

1525
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,333
Me. Pick me.

1526
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,008
Can you pick me? Can you pick me?

1527
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,758
We're only picking one, guys.
This is not a gang rape, okay.

1528
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,089
You sit down. We'll take Brad.

1529
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:23,347
Yes!

1530
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,841
My favorite neighbor.

1531
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,767
He picked me, he picked me.

1532
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,143
Hi, I'm Brad.

1533
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:29,391
You touch her, I'll fuck you up!

1534
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,763
- Hey!
- It was nice meeting you.

1535
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:31,894
Dick.

1536
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:34,067
This is only a simulation, okay?
Cairn it down.

1537
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,859
Well, that's what
I'd do in this situation.

1538
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,608
I'll fuck him up!

1539
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,355
Paul, now.

1540
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,532
Honey, I had to grab her <i>ass.</i>
Look, I was the rapist!

1541
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,029
- You're a perv.
- It was role playing.

1542
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,202
What the hell are you doing?

1543
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,370
What?

1544
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,743
"What?" You look like shit.

1545
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,291
I feel like I look great.

1546
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,164
This is a critical time, Paul. Okay?

1547
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:53,711
We cannot afford to mess this up.

1548
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,881
I agree. You don't need
all this Kumbaya shit.

1549
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,378
Excuse me? I blended in, okay?

1550
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,585
I'm an influential member
of this community now.

1551
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,796
Have some respect and act accordingly.

1552
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,924
Paul?

1553
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,851
The hotel wants you
to pay your $47,000 bill

1554
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,894
or they're kicking us out.

1555
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,315
Yeah, honey?

1556
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,565
What are you doing?

1557
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,227
I'm praying.

1558
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,358
Well,

1559
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:22,156
you should pray for $500

1560
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,483
to relocate a pair of Jimmy Choos

1561
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:25,409
from Neiman's to my shoe closet.

1562
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,577
Okay.

1563
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,622
Secret Agent Sorina
needs pimpy shoes for proper spying.

1564
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:32,583
Secret agent,
Jimmy Choo shoes, I got it.

1565
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,785
Mmm.

1566
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,799
Jimmy Choo shoes. Cash.

1567
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,427
<i>Sometimes, when you hit rock bottom,</i>

1568
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,970
<i>you happen to be on the 20th floor.</i>

1569
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,425
<i>I had a choice. Take the fast way down,</i>

1570
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,430
<i>or find a way to keep climbing.</i>

1571
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,688
Lord God, this place is depressing.

1572
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,523
And so is this.

1573
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,651
No matter how it gets there,
your John Hancock shows

1574
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:05,483
notarized, even at a 90-degree angle.

1575
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,568
It's all legal and binding.

1576
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,451
Oh, funny thing,
when a man's blindfolded,

1577
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,078
electro-shocked, beaten with sex toys,

1578
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,750
and hung like dry cleaning,

1579
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,623
he tends to sign just about anything.

1580
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,247
The Sun Gym Gang
has successfully acquired

1581
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,582
every asset you had.

1582
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,542
And they're enjoying it.

1583
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,586
So I don't have a move?

1584
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,640
Because if that's true,
I'm not paying you a fucking dime!

1585
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,182
You don't have a fucking dime.

1586
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,509
What happens now?

1587
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,099
Now I go to work.

1588
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,642
After a couple months with us,
you won't even recognize yourself,

1589
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,851
trust me.

1590
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,896
I trust you.

1591
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,609
As you can see here, we've got
all brand new Cybex equipment.

1592
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,240
All the latest stuff.
Want to start out with some curls?

1593
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,325
You have the perfect frame
for bodybuilding.

1594
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,576
I'm going to get you so jacked.

1595
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,907
I'd love to get jacked.

1596
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,868
What kind of work do you do, Ed?

1597
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,498
Lawn and garden supplies.

1598
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,296
Benches, birdbaths, stuff like that.

1599
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,084
Oh, yeah? I got a pretty big yard myself.

1600
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,627
Oh, yeah? Where?

1601
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,462
Old Cutler Cove.

1602
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:11,512
Wow. I didn't know trainers did so well.

1603
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,638
You know, you believe
you deserve it and the universe...

1604
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,937
will serve it.
Yeah, I've heard that before.

1605
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,561
- Jonny Wu says that.
- Yeah. I v commercial.

1606
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,025
I love that guy.
All right, let's hit the chest press.

1607
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,981
Lawn supplies, huh?

1608
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:27,152
I got me a riding mower.
Snapper 342, you know it?

1609
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:34,451
Yeah, it's a beauty.
It's a zero-turn model, right?

1610
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:35,823
Yep.

1611
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,042
It's got one of the best decks around.

1612
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,995
It even stands up to Florida's sandy soil.

1613
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,796
You might be my new favorite client.

1614
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,172
Now, come on, you're growing.

1615
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,670
Let's go. Let's go stretch those pecs.

1616
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:48,920
How'd you happen to choose this gym?

1617
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:50,550
A friend of mine recommended it.

1618
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,176
He said
you worked him over pretty good.

1619
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,133
That's what I like to hear.
Who's that?

1620
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,976
Victor Kershaw.

1621
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,647
How is Vic?

1622
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:02,692
I don't really know.
I can't get him on the phone.

1623
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:05,937
Well, maybe he's on vacation.

1624
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,863
- Who's that?
- Kershaw.

1625
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,483
Oh, yeah. I'm sure that's what it is.

1626
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,115
<i>I've been here before.
And I'm not proud of this.</i>

1627
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,039
To my dearest Adrian.

1628
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:30,177
You are my sun, my moon,

1629
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,133
<i>my Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</i>

1630
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,715
I love that show.

1631
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,523
He got the bag! He got the bag!

1632
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,449
Drop the bag! Drop it!

1633
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,290
My grandfather,

1634
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:11,047
he said to me,
"Never marry a black man."

1635
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,755
I don't know why.
He thought they were all dodgy.

1636
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,223
But he's dead now.

1637
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,513
From racism. No, it was a cement truck.

1638
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:27,310
Hello. ls the haircut line here?

1639
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:28,895
I just need a little trim.

1640
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,152
Oh, shit.

1641
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,949
Oh, shit!

1642
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:44,793
He's over here!

1643
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:45,995
Come on down here.

1644
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,455
In here, go.

1645
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:48,630
- Freeze!

1646
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,315
<i>"PAUL". Well, this plan didn't work.</i>

1647
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:12,817
Cover the back!

1648
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,987
She makes me
the happiest man in the world!

1649
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,989
<i>"PAUL". This plan was just practice.</i>

1650
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,794
<i>But I had another plan.</i>

1651
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:32,508
<i>Frank Griga,
the phone-sex douche from the club.</i>

1652
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,469
<i>He wouldn't be as easy as a bank.</i>

1653
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,807
<i>But as it turns out...
</i> In the water!

1654
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,141
Fire!

1655
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,479
<i>A bank wasn't all that easy.</i>

1656
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,711
Motherfucker!

1657
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:16,877
Fuck!

1658
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,591
That's all I got.

1659
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,598
What a dick.

1660
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,934
<i>Luge'?</i>

1661
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:26,304
Hey, Lugo! Goddang it.

1662
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:27,846
Oh.

1663
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,773
Oh, Danny. Danny?

1664
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,809
- Will you shut the fuck up?

1665
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:33,861
Slow down, Paul.

1666
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,487
Did you do something bad?

1667
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,776
Maybe a little.

1668
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,198
You're all fucking green.

1669
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:40,359
I fucked up! Oh, I've got to sit down.

1670
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,537
Om Dan... Oh!

1671
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,531
Oh!

1672
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,537
They got my toe, Danny!

1673
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:48,663
- They got my toe.
- Jesus!

1674
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:52,372
- I know, Jesus!
- You can see the bone.

1675
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,757
Put that fucking thing away now!

1676
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:55,833
Can they reattach it?

1677
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:56,963
No, Paul, they can't, okay?

1678
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,339
Because that's gonna bring questions

1679
01:19:58,419 --> 01:19:59,762
and the fucking heat.

1680
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,467
God gave you 10, now you got nine.

1681
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,548
You've got to deal with that, okay?

1682
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,258
Frank Griga.

1683
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,223
He's got millions.

1684
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:09,396
And we can take it. You know why?

1685
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,648
'Cause we're do-ers.

1686
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,317
I gave you a second chance,
and what did you do?

1687
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,190
You put it right up your fucking nose.

1688
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:16,612
Oh, no, no, it's not just that!

1689
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,907
It's a little bit of that.

1690
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:23,781
You're broke, all right?

1691
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,158
And now you want me
to solve your problems

1692
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,864
by going fucking cowboy
on some porn king?

1693
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,574
Hey, what's going on? What...

1694
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,125
- Why's your head green?
- Yeah.

1695
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,332
I made a mistake.

1696
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,379
He blew his whole cut,
now he wants to do another job.

1697
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,456
Is that right?

1698
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,175
Why did you say it like that?

1699
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,877
Because I put
all my money in the house,

1700
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,758
and now I need a procedure.

1701
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,259
A procedure?

1702
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,340
I'm a man who just got married

1703
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,925
and his penis don't work, okay?

1704
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,092
You know what?

1705
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,178
Why don't you glue his toe
onto your balls?

1706
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,433
Everyone wins.

1707
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:51,897
Did you remember
to get me some bait?

1708
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:53,770
I will not buy worms.

1709
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:56,106
You're pretty funny.

1710
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,105
Your back?

1711
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,653
This is from your trip
to the gym, isn't it?

1712
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:09,366
No, I just want to
lie here and think about the case.

1713
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,247
Why did Miami PD
ignore this man's story?

1714
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:16,706
His account of what happened
is rather unbelievable,

1715
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:20,384
and other than that,
he's a hard guy to like.

1716
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,757
Mese.

1717
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,838
Hey, you schmuck, you remember me?

1718
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,590
No, should I?

1719
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,220
Well, I should think so,

1720
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,893
seeing <i>as</i> you apparently watched me

1721
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,515
sign my whole life away

1722
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,688
<i>to some fucking weightlifter!</i>

1723
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,351
- John!
- Mr. Kershaw.

1724
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,153
<i>Oh, so you do remember me.
That's funny</i>

1725
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,778
<i>because I don't remember you.
Which must mean you're a liar.</i>

1726
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,153
Get the fuck out!

1727
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,493
Ah...

1728
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,456
I was under the impression
that you were out of town.

1729
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:53,910
Oh, yeah,
I never left town, because I didn't have

1730
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,211
any money to leave town with,

1731
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,458
<i>because you fucking stole it!</i>

1732
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:01,709
Now give me my money back!

1733
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:08,882
Fuck!

1734
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:15,640
If that dog pees in the pool, you're fired!

1735
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,100
Hey! Victor Kershaw
just called my office!

1736
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:19,518
What'd he say?

1737
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,200
You fucking out of your mind? You fuck!

1738
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,413
What'd he say, John?

1739
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:33,490
He wants his stuff back!

1740
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:34,575
- He wants all of it!
- Shut up!

1741
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,168
Did he forget he gave it to me?

1742
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:37,369
He wants the whole nut.

1743
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,710
This phone's going to cost you $43.

1744
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,516
Good tonight. Come on, let's go.

1745
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:51,808
- Give me a whoop-whoop!
Whoop-whoop!

1746
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,553
<i>You talk to your mommy, you bitch?</i>

1747
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,105
Victor, how's it going?

1748
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,270
I feel kind of just like shit, John.

1749
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,692
<i>Watch your language, dude.</i>

1750
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,066
Shut the fuck up!

1751
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,439
No, no, no. No, not you.
Not you. I'm so sorry.

1752
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,819
Fuck you, you fucking piece of shit!

1753
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:08,776
You got the worst karma ever!

1754
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:11,829
Victor, I feel horrible about this, okay?

1755
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,282
Let me swing by there
and make it right. What's your address?

1756
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:15,661
You got a pencil?

1757
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,835
I'm at 143 Fuck You Avenue

1758
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,503
on the corner of Blow Me and Die.

1759
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,670
Listen, tell me where you are

1760
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,377
and I'll bring by the forms
for you to sign.

1761
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,963
It'll be all legit. It'll make this right.

1762
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,515
These fucking guys hustled me
like they hustled you!

1763
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,682
I am furious!

1764
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:33,884
<i>Now where are you?</i>

1765
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,765
I'm at your house, John,
fucking your wife.

1766
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:38,272
<i>I'm not telling you where I am, John!</i>

1767
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,099
I'll call you later to set a meet.

1768
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,939
That went like shit.

1769
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,108
- What do we do now?
- Star 69 him.

1770
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,653
You want me to have sex with him?

1771
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:52,077
Press the star key,
press the six and press the nine!

1772
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,831
Seven Seas Motel.

1773
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,578
How did you do that?

1774
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:15,096
Fuck!

1775
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,725
What's with you clowns?

1776
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,604
What the... Hey,
snatch that Cabbage Patch!

1777
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:30,361
All right, here's the deal, little fella,

1778
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,317
I'm gonna head-butt you
and knock you out, okay?

1779
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,824
<i>Well, if he's not there,
then I don't know where he is.</i>

1780
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,247
The only guy he talks to is
the guy who pays for his room.

1781
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,323
What guy?

1782
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,788
Sorry. Classified information.

1783
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,999
No peeking through the hole!

1784
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,914
<i>I recently got married</i>

1785
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,092
<i>and I was looking
for a place to have a honeymoon.</i>

1786
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:49,839
<i>I was hoping maybe
you could show me around.</i>

1787
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,763
<i>Why would you
want to have your honeymoon here?</i>

1788
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,306
<i>Oh, this place has
a lot of fond memories for me.</i>

1789
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,930
<i>The very first time
I bashed a man's skull in was here</i>

1790
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,602
<i>and it was a mess!</i>

1791
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,521
But that bat was aluminum.
I've switched to wood.

1792
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,270
<i>So you should
get your ass out here right now</i>

1793
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,521
<i>or I'll bash your brains all over that wall</i>

1794
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:06,978
<i>with one fucking swing!</i>

1795
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,562
<i>Okay, sure.</i>

1796
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,282
Let me show you the pool.

1797
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,614
Holy shit. It's my client.

1798
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,618
I told him I was gonna give him
a fucking body like mine!

1799
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,578
- Unreal.
- What a fucking cocksuck.

1800
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:25,662
I can't wait to go in his house.

1801
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:27,748
I'm gonna shit in his bathroom.
That's what I'ma do.

1802
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,086
<i>It takes a little finesse
to tell the Chief of Police</i>

1803
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,592
<i>that his guys missed something big.</i>

1804
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:39,388
His story's true.
Your guys went to sleep on it.

1805
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,562
Yeah, you're a soft touch, Ed.

1806
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,729
I'll take a look at what you got,

1807
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,727
but it sounds like a nonstarter to me.

1808
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:45,978
George, I got a trunk full of evidence.

1809
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,901
Believe me, it's a starter.

1810
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,736
<i>Hands</i> up! <i>Hands</i> up!

1811
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:52,739
A Colombian plus torture
equals bad news, Ed,

1812
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,657
at 5230, 6200 and 11100,

1813
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,326
for however many nights
it takes Channel 4

1814
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,823
to make me look like
I'm kind of Uncle Juan

1815
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:59,075
defending the rights of drug dealers.

1816
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,828
Drug dealer?
The guy sold submarine sandwiches.

1817
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,160
And Pablo Escobar
was a florist. Come on.

1818
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,494
Ed, you know this.

1819
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,420
Anything below the Keys
is like a boil on my ass.

1820
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:08,497
These guys are still out there

1821
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,627
and they're gonna get hungry again.

1822
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,003
You should get on it.

1823
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,298
<i>Trust between</i> a <i>trainer and his client</i>

1825
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,716

1827
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,307
Hey!

1828
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:28,691
There's a white lady in there

1829
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,519
making a really nice cherry pie.

1830
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,195
I love cherry pies.

1831
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,276
Cops.

1832
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,703
What? Why are the police here?

1833
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,451
Somebody called them
on a black guy in their yard!

1834
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,622
What do you think they're doing here?

1835
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:43,824
- Now what?
- Well, we can either

1836
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,659
walk out front or
we can jump in the fucking water.

1837
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:46,743
I can't swim!

1838
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,829
Thanks, guys! Appreciate it.

1839
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,755
All right. Come on, come on!

1840
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,634
Mission abort,
mission abort, mission abort!

1841
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,058
How's your back?

1842
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,980
The old back's fine.

1843
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:09,107
Car wouldn't start, though.

1844
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,605
You've got to get rid of that,
it's an old-man car.

1845
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:14,734
So Mr. Kershaw called.

1846
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,907
He said, "This is how you protect me",

1847
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:18,404
"you pussy son of a bitch?"

1848
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,360
"Fucking thugs come to murder me"

1849
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:21,946
"and where the fuck are you?"

1850
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:23,701
And then he left an address.

1851
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:26,745
Victor!

1852
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,624
Never call bad guys!

1853
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,665
Especially the ones
who are trying to kill you!

1854
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:36,005
You're gonna give me shit
about that right now?

1855
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:38,754
I'm gonna take you home. Clean you up.

1856
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,423
Would you pass me a roll, please?

1857
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,506
Sure.

1858
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,843
You have some tiny trees.

1859
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,518
That's sort of my hobby.

1860
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:46,678
Oh.

1861
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:49,723
Oh! Shit!

1862
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:50,849
Here, let me help you.

1863
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,027
No, I can do it. I can do it.

1864
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:56,688
Come on, let me help.

1865
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,149
I... Ed;

1866
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,830
- Mmm!
- There you go.

1867
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,209
Every man needs to fight for his dignity.

1868
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,375
I have a boat.

1869
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:21,679
I have a boat.

1870
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,015
Sure you do.

1871
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:28,971
<i>Don't don't, do do,
nut up and be like Wu.</i>

1872
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,102
<i>I was so sick of Jonny Wu.</i>

1873
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:32,808
<i>If! had learned anything

1874
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,768
<i>besides what a fucking notary does,</i>

1875
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,524
<i>it's that if you don't

1876
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,276
<i>they can come up
and bite you in the ass.</i>

1877
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,733
<i>Or worse, they hire detectives.</i>

1878
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:49,496
<i>Fuck this Beaver Cleaver shit.
And this nice house.</i>

1879
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,668
<i>But I'm not going backwards.</i>

1880
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:54,462
<i>So the three-finger plan
just needs another finger.</i>

1881
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:55,755
<i>So, what?</i>

1882
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:58,675
Hey, Paul, it's me.
I want you to pick up Adrian.

1883
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,922
We're gonna move on your porn king.

1884
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:09,769
Dibs.

1885
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,022
How are you, sir?

1886
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,353
- Good. How you doing?
- Excellent.

1887
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,278
Yeah. Shut the door, please.

1888
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,321
Now, come on, let's do
the show-and-tell. Come on, boy.

1889
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:24,697
Next.

1890
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,660
India alone has a billion people
as of the last census.

1891
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,041
One billion people, two billion ears.

1892
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:34,040
And until now,
AT&T has had a lock on all of them.

1893
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:35,458
Take a look at our flow chart.

1894
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,999
See this guy, this is a woo-woo Indian.

1895
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,049
We're not going after them.

1896
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,627
We want the red dots, the Gandhi kind.

1897
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,757
Those are Japanese.

1898
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,009
That's phase two.

1899
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,183
We're going multi-continental
on this thing, okay.

1900
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,386
This is a huge organization.

1901
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:51,594
Sorry, boss.

1902
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:53,180
- Wedding pictures, sorry.
- Ugh, you're killing me.

1903
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:54,723
Here we go.

1904
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,558
Percentage of Indian
telecommunication market.

1905
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:59,815
We own it, we guarantee it.
You're in ground-floor entry.

1906
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,647
Boom, skyrocket. Next.

1907
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:02,989
Frankie!

1908
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,570
Chopin, stop!

1909
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,235
Ow!

1910
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:10,323
Come here. Meet my friends.
Show them your tits.

1911
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:11,705
Look, you like them?

1912
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,116
Huh?

1913
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:16,207
<i>Mad the doctor put 'm an extra 500 eds.</i>

1914
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,421
- Like Jell-O.
- They're new.

1915
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,132
Impressive. Are you in?

1916
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:22,629
Do they have phone sex in India?

1917
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,087
Because she's the best dirty talker
in the business.

1918
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,717
Come on, give us a few moans.

1919
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:28,764
Come on, that's it.

1920
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:30,513
Nice.

1921
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,936
All right, so what's
the minimum investment?

1922
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,188
500,000.

1923
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:38,608
- Isn't he your limo driver?
- And partner.

1924
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:39,684
He is a full-fledged partner.

1925
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,645
- Did I meet you at the...
- You did.

1926
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:43,605
- You're the Jesus guy.
- I am.

1927
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,160
What's the maximum investment?

1928
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:52,614
<i>Some people wouldn't try it again.</i>

1929
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,620
<i>Some people would say
quit while you're ahead.</i>

1930
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:57,331
<i>Well, some people are pussies.</i>

1931
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,253
<i>Guys like Frank Griga don't quit.</i>

1932
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:00,421
<i>They take it on the chin,</i>

1933
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,795
<i>learn from their mistakes,
double down and do it.</i>

1934
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,010
<i>Our plan was solid.
Our skills were cutting edge.</i>

1935
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:09,431
<i>We just needed to put ourselves
in a position to succeed.</i>

1936
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,387
<i>And that position was Adrian's house.</i>

1937
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,141
You guys look so sweet.

1938
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:17,810
Yeah.

1939
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,307
Where's your wife now?

1940
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,230
She's pulling a double in the ER tonight.

1941
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:22,560
You look nice.

1942
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,817
Thanks, man.
She's a big girl, you can't handle it.

1943
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,649
- Hey, you know what we need?
- Mmm?

1944
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:28,904
Some music! Right?

1945
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:29,985
So what do you think,
we go in the other room

1946
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,786
- and talk a little business?
- Yeah, yeah. Let's do it.

1947
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:35,157
Let's get this party started!

1948
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,083
Best song ever!

1949
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:38,835
Show them how you can
shake it up, baby.

1950
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,833
- Oh-oh!
- Keep your hands off the new tits, pal.

1951
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,914
Okay. The hands will be on the <i>ass!</i>

1952
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,295
- I'm coming for you.
- Come on, baby.

1953
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,500
Give me that thing.

1954
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:47,218
Oh... Oh... Oh!

1955
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,297
So, I ran your numbers
past my accountant

1956
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,803
and it looks like
blue skies and clear sailing.

1957
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:54,600
Fantastic.
I've got the contracts right here.

1958
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,599
Oh, God, that is nasty.

1959
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,813
For who's ever gonna do the investing.

1960
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:00,640
- I got an eggroll for you, baby.
- Yeah, you do!

1961
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:06,821
Frank, I don't think
I'm following you right now.

1962
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:08,781
I want to meet directly with the board.

1963
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,234
I mean, no offense, Daniel,

1964
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:12,990
but your skill set
doesn't put my mind at ease.

1965
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:20,373
- I want to see you dance!
- Come on, Paul!

1966
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:21,419
I don't dance,

1967
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:23,371
but I got something
much better than dancing.

1968
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,048
Yeah!

1969
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,841
Whoo! Come on, baby!

1970
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,933
Okay. So what exactly
is my skill set then, Frank?

1971
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:36,351
Please, tell me.

1972
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:39,600
I was being polite. Look, Daniel,

1973
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,101
you seem like a really good guy, okay?

1974
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:42,558
We could totally hang out, okay?

1975
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,517
We can go chase
some gash, you know?

1976
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:45,648
But, uh, frankly,

1977
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,855
I'm not comfortable
with you having a say in my money.

1978
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:49,439
So you stand here in my friend's house

1979
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,399
and you tell me you don't trust me?

1980
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:52,484
You know what? You're right.

1981
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,569
Maybe this isn't the place
to discuss this.

1982
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:57,451
What? You want to go
over my head to the board?

1983
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:00,580
Hey, look, Daniel,

1984
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:02,501
you know a little something
about the business world,

1985
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,329
but not nearly <i>as</i> much <i>as</i> you think.

1986
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,714
I mean, some of the things you say
are just comical.

1987
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:08,250
I don't think you're a hard worker.

1988
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,714
I'm not saying you're a fucking moron,

1989
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:13,422
but this is a complicated venture, okay?

1990
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:15,178
<i>It takes professionals. You guys,</i>

1991
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:16,303
you're a bunch of fucking amateurs.

1992
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:18,601
Motherfucker!

1993
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:20,678
Nobody calls me a fucking amateur!

1994
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:23,056
Do you know who you're fucking with?

1995
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:28,607
- Come on! Sixty-one!
- Frank?

1996
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:32,031
Sixty-two! Sixty-three!
Come on, push it, baby!

1997
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:33,445
- Where's Frank?
- Sixty-four!

1998
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:34,947
- Where the fuck is Frank?
- Look at this!

1999
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,118
KRISZTINAI Frank!

2000
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:38,196
Sixty-five! Look, 66!

2001
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:40,123
No one calls me an amateur!

2002
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:41,199
No one calls me a fucking amateur!

2003
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,625
Jesus Christ.
You could have fucking killed me!

2004
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,498
You fucking could have
killed me, you cunt!

2005
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:45,954
You fucking motherfucker!

2006
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,876
No one calls me
a fucking amateur! No one!

2007
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:54,637
Because I work hard!
I do work fucking hard!

2008
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:57,716
I fucking work!

2009
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:03,680
No! Oh, God. Please, no!

2010
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,483
Hey, get out of there. Go, get, get, get!

2011
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,819
- I'm going for 80!
- Give me five more, baby!

2012
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,323
Yeah!

2013
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,155
That's a new house record!

2014
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:21,994
KRISZTINAI Frank!

2015
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,290
Look at this!
Go, push it! Fucking push it!

2016
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,542
- Frank?
- Yeah, baby!

2017
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:34,928
- What did you do?
- It was an accident.

2018
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:37,381
Jesus fucking Christ!

2019
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,511
He fell!
The thing just hit him in the head

2020
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:40,683
when he fell down.

2021
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,101
- You fucking cocksucker!
- No, no, please, don't!

2022
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:45,980
No!

2023
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,523
Grab that fucking crazy bitch!

2024
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,193
- Oh, what the fuck... What happened?
- It was an accident!

2025
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:51,315
You were supposed to talk to him!

2026
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,068
- Take her, Paul! Take her!
- I was talking to him!

2027
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,487
Paul, Is he dead?

2028
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:58,989
You see how those weights
are flush flat on the fucking floor?

2029
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:01,491
Well, they shouldn't be, because there's
a fucking head in between them.

2030
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:03,786
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2031
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:05,958
- Ow! She's biting me!
- Keep her fucking quiet!

2032
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:08,082
Roll her over! Show me her ass!

2033
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:10,209
I got upset and...

2034
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:14,342
He called me a fucking amateur!

2035
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:17,591
And you fucking hit him with a weight?

2036
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,887
He said
he was going to sign the papers,

2037
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,089
then he wouldn't sign, then he got upset

2038
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:21,174
and he said he wanted to see the board,

2039
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:22,258
then I said no,
he couldn't see the board,

2040
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:23,389
"I don't want you to see the board."

2041
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:24,469
"Why'd you call me an amateur?"

2042
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,974
Then he got upset,
then he fucking said something else

2043
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,055
and I got upset and he fucking fell.

2044
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,355
I think he fell
or I pushed him or something.

2045
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,308
Then you killed him!

2046
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:32,940
What did you do to her?

2047
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:34,942
I gave her a horse tranquilizer.

2048
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,323
Oh, shit.

2049
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:38,983
She'll be fine.

2050
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:46,620
33, 19, 22. That's
the safe combination, right?

2051
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,335
Is that Yugoslavian?

2052
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,997
Okay, I need it in English, okay, baby?

2053
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:54,416
- Seventeen.
- All right, no, no.

2054
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:56,376
33, 19, 22.

2055
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:59,383
Okay, this is now a salvage op! Let's go!

2056
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:00,672
What does that even mean?

2057
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,803
It means
I'm getting that car and stuff in the safe.

2058
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:03,883
Oh, shit.

2059
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:05,843
Oh!

2060
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,644
This is so bad.

2061
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:09,688
All right, hey. Keep her quiet, okay?

2062
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,103
And stay by the phone.

2063
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:12,604
Make sure the sperm mogul's
on ice until I get back.

2064
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:15,107
- What do you mean "on ice"?
- In ice cubes in the bathtub, okay!

2065
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,817
Hey, when does Robin get home?

2066
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,614
Her shift's over at noon.

2067
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:19,737
- Okay, great.

2068
01:36:19,816 --> 01:36:21,944
Calm the fuck down. I got to get a pump.

2069
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,699
Yeah, take a moment.

2070
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,662
That's it. That's good.

2071
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:31,290
Listen, Danny,

2072
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:33,838
I know what it's like to
think you killed somebody.

2073
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:36,132
And it hurts.

2074
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,169
I mean, you got Jesus and the devil...

2075
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:40,253
That's it, get it.

2076
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,134
Jesus, devil,
swirling all up in your head.

2077
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,181
I was lucky, 'cause my guy lived.

2078
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:45,926
So you must really feel like shit.

2079
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,727
You're right, Paul.

2080
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:51,106
Let's just hope
Jesus is as forgiving as they say, right?

2081
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:52,181
Oh, He is.

2082
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:53,938
Adrian, do something about this rug.

2083
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:55,143
Look, just say the dog did it, okay?

2084
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:56,398
Everything else
will be gone before Robin...

2085
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:57,979
Looks like he killed the dog.

2086
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,359
Hey, crank the AC. He's starting to reek.

2087
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:00,531
Let's go, Paul, come on.

2088
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:01,607
Hang in there, buddy.

2089
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:03,068
Bro, you better hurry up, man!

2090
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:04,403
We'll be back!

2091
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:05,862
Where is my dog, bro?

2092
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,165
I see it. I see the emotion,

2093
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,370
and I see all that Satan shit swirling.

2094
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:16,752
I don't need your shit
right now, okay? Please.

2095
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:20,005
I say it because I care.
I'm just trying to be a friend.

2096
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,891
Be calm.

2097
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:44,825
Holy shit.

2098
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,279
Holy Moses.

2099
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:50,331
- You're a fucking genius. You did it!

2100
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:52,283
I love Jesus, too! You know that, right?

2101
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:54,077
Look at the size of this thing!

2102
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,833
It's like a fucking treasure chest!

2103
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,218
Come on, baby. Come on.

2104
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:05,342
33... 19... 22...

2105
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:07,890
Shit!

2106
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,346
Come on!

2107
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:10,642
33...

2108
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:12,303
19...

2109
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:14,521
22...

2110
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:20,521
- You fucked this up!
- This is not my fault!

2111
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:21,904
Oh, man.

2112
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:25,609
- What's the combo?
- 32, 19, 22!

2113
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:30,906
Yo, DL, where you at, man?

2114
01:38:30,988 --> 01:38:33,207
Put the Yugoslav on the phone.
I need the right safe combo.

2115
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:34,955
No, you got to get back here, man.

2116
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,411
Robin's going to be home
in a few hours.

2117
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:37,461
She gets off at noon.

2118
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:39,505
No, I think they gave me
the wrong fucking number!

2119
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,423
- Frank?
- No, she... Shit.

2120
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,382
Hello?

2121
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,471
You wrote it down wrong.

2122
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:51,593
You gonna try to get away? Huh?

2123
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:53,098
- There's some more!

2124
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:55,475
Now, come on, get up.
My wife's coming home.

2125
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,439
See you in the living room.

2126
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,944
Stop drinking!
You've got to write the code down now.

2127
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,487
- I'm ready.
- All right, what's the safe combo?

2128
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:04,655
Put the phone where she can hear.

2129
01:39:09,735 --> 01:39:10,987
She can't hear nothing, man.

2130
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,071
What's the problem?

2131
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:14,123
The bitch is cold, bro.

2132
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:15,621
What? No.

2133
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:18,411
Her soul has left her body.

2134
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:20,254
Tell me it's not fucking true, now!

2135
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,002
I mean, you told me to give
her some more tranquilizer,

2136
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:23,082
and I did, and I gave her two shots,

2137
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:24,133
and I think I gave her too much,

2138
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,255
'cause now she's not fucking breathing.

2139
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:26,551
We were dancing
and having such a good time

2140
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,671
and I was smacking her ass
and now she's fucking dead!

2141
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:30,051
And you're not here, bro!

2142
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,766
No. No! Not...

2143
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,641
Did you get the code?

2144
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,972
<i>No! No! No!</i>

2145
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:42,109
This isn't happening.

2146
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,070
This is not happening.

2147
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:45,647
Jonny Wu says
it's all about seeing the humor

2148
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:49,200
in the chaos, right? Right?
Come on! Let's bolt!

2149
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:50,618
You didn't get the code?

2150
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:52,199
Let's go, we got shit to do.

2151
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:53,495
Tell me the code. I'm ready.

2152
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,369
Come on. We don't
have the code. Put this on.

2153
01:39:58,284 --> 01:40:00,833
Yeah, I got the Lambo.
Hey, you want that dog?

2154
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:03,256
That Yorkshire's
about $1,250 if it's a purebred.

2155
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:04,378
Hey.

2156
01:40:04,457 --> 01:40:05,800
Shit, we've got to get
something for the bodies.

2157
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,047
Hey, little buddy.

2158
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:08,962
You hungry'?

2159
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:12,931
Come on, come on!

2160
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:15,719
What a little boy.

2161
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:17,140
I love purple.

2162
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:20,226
It's not smart taking a dead man's car.

2163
01:40:20,306 --> 01:40:21,933
Not smart at all.

2164
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,355
Oh, shit! Oh, no!

2165
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:29,941
Shit! Oh, she's going to kill me!

2166
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,445
Oh, shit.

2167
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:48,379
Lost my dog.

2168
01:40:48,918 --> 01:40:50,795
You've got to slow down!

2169
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:51,879
You're tipping her over!

2170
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,091
I'm not driving too fast.
I'm following the fucking speed limit.

2171
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:55,720
I got 48 holes in my carpet!

2172
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,302
It smells awful back here.

2173
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,303
See, I'm dealing with shit
on a whole other level.

2174
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:01,389
Y'all can't even fathom
the level that I'm on.

2175
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,474
You're making me nervous,
okay! There are cops ahead.

2176
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:04,605
Come on, guys! I'm concentrating!

2177
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:05,810
I think I'm going to be sick.

2178
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,903
For a big fucker, you complain a lot!

2179
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:09,318
What am I going to tell my wife?

2180
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:10,398
Just fucking lie.

2181
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,280
Sick.

2182
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:16,161
I booted.

2183
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:18,080
Paul, you're fucking disgusting.

2184
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:23,961
Reuben'? Come here. Is that you?

2185
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:26,004
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

2186
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:30,085
Paul, we got a job to do,
are you up here hiding?

2187
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,419
I need you downstairs, okay?

2188
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,004
I need you to secure
and maintain a profile.

2189
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,179
Me and Adrian are going to Home Depot

2190
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:36,974
to get what we need. Let's go, come on.

2191
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:41,684
I am not staying here alone
with those two dead bodies.

2192
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:43,059
I will freak out.

2193
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:45,308
What do you mean "no"?
This was your idea.

2194
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:46,392
You want to get out of this,

2195
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:47,442
you better learn to take responsibility.

2196
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:48,770
Don't be a don't-er. You'll regret it.

2197
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:50,355
I already regret it.

2198
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:56,493
Get me the police.

2199
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:59,121
<i>There is life after death.</i>

2200
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:00,823
<i>Of that, I am sure.</i>

2201
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:06,834
<i>But I'm also pretty sure
dead people no longer need their stuff.</i>

2202
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:10,249
<i>And I did.</i>

2203
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:15,964
Oh!

2204
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,681
- All right, cleaning supplies.
- Check.

2205
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:28,943
Mr. and Mrs. Griga,
how are you? Chopin?

2206
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:33,030
Hello, little baby, I'm here.

2207
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:34,357
- Chopin?

2208
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:35,816
We're gonna clean them, chop them,

2209
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,278
put them in buckets. Right here.

2210
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:39,704
Dissolve them with lye.

2211
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:40,905
No evidence.

2212
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:46,957
Check.

2213
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:48,504
Adrian?

2214
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:50,673
<i>This is Officer Wilson,
Miami-Dade Police.</i>

2215
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:52,842
<i>Animal Services
has recovered</i> a <i>greyhound</i>

2216
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,260
<i>that is registered to your address</i>

2217
01:42:54,335 --> 01:42:56,383
<i>but we believe the dog may be stolen.</i>

2218
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:59,636
<i>You need to contact us please,
at your earliest convenience.</i>

2219
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:01,058
<i>305...</i>

2220
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:02,973
We got a body part, a human toe.

2221
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:04,304
Get a forensic unit here right away.

2222
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,105
He loves dog like his own child.

2223
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,602
Team Jesus!

2224
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:11,686
Feel great. Doyle feels great.

2225
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,320
<i>May cause anxiety, aggression,
seizure, suicidal thoughts, dementia...</i>

2226
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:19,278
Ah! I feel like shit now.

2227
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:22,034
<i>Jesus, forgive me.
Forgive my sins.</i>

2228
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:24,699
We're back! Come on, let's go.

2229
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:25,908
You can do that shit all day in prison

2230
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:27,459
if we don't get these bodies out of here!

2231
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:29,629
I am in the middle of a superset.

2232
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,043
Hey! Did you take the wedding ring?

2233
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:34,004
No, I did not. No.

2234
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,127
Fucking crackhead.

2235
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:21,589
Hey, should we save her implants?

2236
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:23,341
Well, not unless you want them
for paperweights.

2237
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:26,143
No, resale of medical devices
is a big business, man.

2238
01:44:26,218 --> 01:44:29,017
I'm married to someone
in the medical field. I know this.

2239
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:31,432
Then stop playing with her tits, okay?

2240
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,893
And Windex our fingerprints off now.

2241
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,274
Well, what about their fingerprints?

2242
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:37,400
What about them?

2243
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:41,075
What are we gonna do
with their fingerprints on their fingers?

2244
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:48,954
I'll think of something, all right?

2245
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,042
- Are you really going to do that?

2246
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:57,383
- Danny, that's disgusting!
- Shit!

2247
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,426
- What's wrong with it?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

2248
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,596
- What, is it plugged in?
- Yeah, it's plugged in!

2249
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:02,762
Well, press the button!

2250
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:04,597
Give me that, let me do it, man!

2251
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:07,305
- Fuck if we got time for this.

2252
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:09,637
See? Daddy worked power tools, baby!

2253
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,190
Get it! Go, go, go! Get it, get it, get it!

2254
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:16,652
- Am <i>I</i> hitting it?

2255
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:20,193
What happened? Come on!

2256
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:23,446
- Oh, shit!
- What?

2257
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:25,199
It's stuck in her hair!

2258
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:26,574
Give me this thing.

2259
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:31,079
Figures! Made in China?

2260
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,452
It's a piece of China fucking crap!

2261
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,329
I fucking told you to get
a gas-powered one,

2262
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:38,086
not some fucking piece of
electric China crap! Shit!

2263
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:41,009
Well, you're the one who said
we didn't have time to stop for gas!

2264
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,304
- Grab her arm.
- What are you doing?

2265
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,381
I'm going old school.

2266
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:47,596
Go.

2267
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:49,389
I'm going to chop that fucker right off.

2268
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:52,221
Wait, wait, wait. All right, go. Go, go.

2269
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,768
Fuck you "Ah!" ing about? Hold it, man.

2270
01:45:57,852 --> 01:46:00,446
- I almost chopped your finger!
- Go! Ah!

2271
01:46:01,105 --> 01:46:03,107
Come on!

2272
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:11,164
Let's go, Paul.

2273
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:14,293
I need you to grill
these fingerprints off, all right?

2274
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:18,085
Grill these fingerprints off?
Are you nuts?

2275
01:46:20,165 --> 01:46:22,293
No, I'm not nuts, Paul.

2276
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,799
But I am about fed up with
your defeatist attitude, okay?

2277
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:26,973
Now grill those fucking hands. Now.

2278
01:46:27,256 --> 01:46:28,633
You need to be more positive, Paul.

2279
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:31,344
Just make a positive effort.

2280
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,270
- What's up?
- Hey, Ed.

2281
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:35,894
We've connected these people to
the bodybuilders you were talking about.

2282
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:37,145
They've gone missing.

2283
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:43,276
These people aren't
just missing, George.

2284
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:44,447
They're probably dead.

2285
01:46:44,607 --> 01:46:47,076
It's a big department, Ed.
We can't do everything right.

2286
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:50,993
I didn't ask for everything,
George. I asked for one thing.

2287
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,826
I told you these guys
were gonna get hungry again.

2288
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:05,420
What seems to be the problem?

2289
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:06,503
It's a piece of China crap.

2290
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:08,430
It worked for two seconds,
then it cut off.

2291
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:09,506
Well, for 20 more,

2292
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:10,762
you can get free parts
and replacements.

2293
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:13,765
We strongly recommend it on all
our customer power tool investments.

2294
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:15,312
Oh, we don't want to
hear about that rip-off.

2295
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:23,358
Sir, there appears to be fur in the works.

2296
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,319
I don't see no fur
in that nonworking chainsaw.

2297
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:34,953
How funny was that
when that scumbag shit himself

2298
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:37,376
when your dog almost bit his balls off?

2299
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:39,962
What do we got? Description again?

2300
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:41,004
White male, 30s.

2301
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,081
All right, standby, we're en route.

2302
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:43,461
Leave that stuff, we got to go.

2303
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:49,551
Well, either you're dumb
or blind, but that's fur.

2304
01:47:50,547 --> 01:47:52,595
Go on, pick out another one.

2305
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:54,894
Save the drama for your mama.

2306
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:18,075
Holy shit! What the fuck?

2307
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:25,712
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

2308
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,338
You got to cook this shit outside.

2309
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:30,921
Be careful, that's hot.
You'll burn yourself.

2310
01:48:32,297 --> 01:48:33,344
You know, you're like a three-year-old!

2311
01:48:33,424 --> 01:48:34,391
You're dropping the fingernails.

2312
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,931
A three-year old...
It Stunk like shit.

2313
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:38,388
You put it in the fucking street?

2314
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,098
I didn't think you'd be pissed.

2315
01:48:41,181 --> 01:48:42,899
It got really smoky in there, Danny.

2316
01:48:42,975 --> 01:48:45,194
Are you out of your fucking mind?

2317
01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:48,148
<i>In AA, they teach you
to sit with your feelings.</i>

2318
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:49,948
<i>Look under the bed and see for yourself</i>

2319
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:52,197
<i>that there's no monster under there.</i>

2320
01:48:52,276 --> 01:48:55,496
<i>But the problem is,
sometimes the monster is there.</i>

2321
01:48:55,571 --> 01:48:59,166
<i>And sometimes,
you've just got to fucking run.</i>

2322
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:00,584
Hey, Paul?

2323
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:05,710
Where the fuck is he?

2324
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:10,295
He's got no fucking accountability!

2325
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:29,230
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

2326
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:32,487
These are your locales.
These are your targets.

2327
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:37,822
We are taking down
these scumbags simultaneously.

2328
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:41,245
We have some making up to do.

2329
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:49,375
Here you go.

2330
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:52,177
Any questions?

2331
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:53,511
Good.

2332
01:49:55,172 --> 01:49:56,594
I feel good.

2333
01:49:57,841 --> 01:49:58,967
Got to get a pump, though.

2334
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:01,019
Need to push that Lambo
into the swamp, bro.

2335
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:19,158
Fuck!

2336
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,667
Get out of the way!

2337
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:35,887
<i>Look at these guys, huh?
Carved from stone!</i>

2338
01:50:47,516 --> 01:50:50,235
Adrian? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

2339
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:00,320
No! No!

2340
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:01,576
- Get down!

2341
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:18,756
- Do not move.
- Let me see your hands.

2342
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:19,840
<i>"PASTOR RANDY". No hard feelings.</i>

2343
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:21,758
Hands behind your back.

2344
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:27,230
Call Daniel!

2345
01:51:27,306 --> 01:51:28,808
<i>- Call Daniel!</i>

2346
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:43,201
Fuck!

2347
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,873
Hey. police, Stgp!

2348
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:49,791
This way. Follow the officer.

2349
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:52,001
Hey, buddy.

2350
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:54,966
How you been?

2351
01:51:56,335 --> 01:51:58,508
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

2352
01:51:59,421 --> 01:52:00,547
<i>He seemed like such a nice guy.</i>

2353
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:02,383
<i>You think you know people...</i>

2354
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:06,891
<i>puppy's gone.</i>

2355
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:08,688
Yeah, he loved your boat.

2356
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:09,981
We went out on it five or six times.

2357
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,025
We had a great sunset cruise.
We took the neighborhood kids.

2358
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,068
Hey, pal. That'll do it.

2359
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:26,081
<i>"GEORGE". We circulated Lugo's picture.</i>

2360
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:28,158
<i>Coast Guard's got the specs
on Lugo's boat.</i>

2361
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:29,789
You mean my boat?

2362
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,666
Your boat.

2363
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,338
Start looking!

2364
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:38,594
According to the other two,
Lugo killed Griga

2365
01:52:38,669 --> 01:52:40,342
before he could get anything,
which means

2366
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,512
he's gonna run out of his money.

2367
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:43,431
My money! My money.

2368
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:45,009
Victor, for God's sake.

2369
01:52:45,092 --> 01:52:47,060
He's right, Ed. We fucked up.

2370
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:48,770
The fact is, Mr. Kershaw, right now,

2371
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:50,438
you're the only source of funding
this guy has got.

2372
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,937
He put all his eggs
in your basket, Victor.

2373
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:55,018
We've got that basket
under 24-hour watch.

2374
01:52:55,227 --> 01:52:57,275
Lugo's gonna come up starving soon.

2375
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:59,356
When he does, we'll get him.

2376
01:52:59,856 --> 01:53:01,608
What if I told you there's another basket

2377
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:04,411
you didn't know about? Offshore.

2378
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:06,989
- Where?
- The Bahamas, where do you think?

2379
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:09,991
So, where do you think he's going?

2380
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:12,669
You could have saved us 20 minutes.

2381
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:13,745
What the hell is wrong with you?

2382
01:53:13,996 --> 01:53:16,499
Now I'm the criminal here?
It's a secret stash.

2383
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:18,592
You're telling me
you don't have a secret stash?

2384
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:20,715
You're a very difficult victim, Victor.

2385
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,087
It's Money Management 101.

2386
01:53:22,254 --> 01:53:24,052
Get a chopper, ASAP.

2387
01:53:31,179 --> 01:53:32,476
<i>My name is Victor Kershaw.</i>

2388
01:53:32,556 --> 01:53:33,933
<i>I'm looking to close my account.</i>

2389
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:37,402
And what would you like to do

2390
01:53:37,477 --> 01:53:39,479
about the safety deposit box?

2391
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:40,856
Well, I'm really in a rush,

2392
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:43,442
but I may as well open it
while I'm here, right?

2393
01:53:59,207 --> 01:54:01,255
His fucking baby booties?

2394
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:05,005
What the... Asshole!

2395
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:07,474
Oh, shit! No cash!

2396
01:54:07,758 --> 01:54:09,476
Where's your bank manager?

2397
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:11,640
This is a United States court order

2398
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,314
authorizing us to freeze
the accounts of a Victor...

2399
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:15,690
Lugo!

2400
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:17,229
- Open the door!
- Lugo!

2401
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:18,481
- Open it!
- Open it up!

2402
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:21,150
Open the gate! Open the gate!

2403
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:24,490
Get the gate!

2404
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:26,322
Lugo!

2405
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:35,752
He's over here!

2406
01:54:35,827 --> 01:54:37,500
Hey! Officer!

2407
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:51,976
Where are they all?

2408
01:54:53,178 --> 01:54:54,680
He's a thief!

2409
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:06,525
<i>Son of</i> a <i>bitch.</i>

2410
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:08,235
<i>Sometimes God just fucks up your order</i>

2411
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:11,117
<i>and you got to chow down
on that shitty shame sandwich.</i>

2412
01:55:27,838 --> 01:55:29,636
Look at you.

2413
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,183
All fucked up.

2414
01:55:31,716 --> 01:55:34,560
It's kind of undignified
being all fucked up by a car,

2415
01:55:34,636 --> 01:55:36,638
isn't it, you silly turd?

2416
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:38,648
- You all right?
- I'm getting there.

2417
01:55:45,981 --> 01:55:47,654
You know, I could have
got you ripped, man.

2418
01:55:47,732 --> 01:55:48,733
You know what your problem is?

2419
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:51,445
Skinnyass quads.
You got no quads, man.

2420
01:55:51,528 --> 01:55:52,700
That was my problem.

2421
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:54,372
I spent a lot of time
building these bad boys.

2422
01:56:00,454 --> 01:56:02,206
Is this all for me?

2423
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,875
Yep. Your own little party.

2424
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:06,175
Wow.

2425
01:56:11,465 --> 01:56:13,718
They're going
to want to know why you did it.

2426
01:56:15,844 --> 01:56:18,063
Well, 'cause I'm a do-er.

2427
01:56:30,025 --> 01:56:34,326
<i>This was the longest and most
bizarre trial in Dade County history.</i>

2428
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:37,411
So, the Central Intelligence Agency.

2429
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:40,377
So you were a stripper and an agent.

2430
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:43,213
Or, as you call yourself,
a field operative.

2431
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:45,791
Lugo and I used to bang a lot.

2432
01:56:45,874 --> 01:56:48,093
But then he passed me to Agent Doyle.

2433
01:56:48,502 --> 01:56:49,549
Miss you, sweetie.

2434
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:52,256
But I'm going to quit the whole CIA thing

2435
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:54,341
to become a movie star.

2436
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,643
<i>"ED". They say truth
is stranger than fiction.</i>

2437
01:56:56,718 --> 01:56:59,471
<i>And no one tells the truth
like a pissed-off wife.</i>

2438
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:01,852
Sir, I officially divorced him last night.

2439
01:57:01,932 --> 01:57:04,856
That's why I can testify
against him today.

2440
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:08,860
Well, I've been working
in the penis industry for 19 months.

2441
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:11,533
I think he lifted weights
to try to compensate

2442
01:57:11,608 --> 01:57:15,033
for the fact that he had a very tiny penis.

2443
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:20,122
It was bent on a 25 degree angle,
like a boomerang.

2444
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:24,079
You see, erectile dysfunction
is nothing to be ashamed about

2445
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:26,290
but being an unfaithful lying shit

2446
01:57:26,373 --> 01:57:28,296
who I know for a fact tried to finger bang

2447
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:31,049
his paralegal in the interview room,

2448
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:33,050
that's a little shamey.

2449
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,675
But being in the medical profession,
I prefer not to judge.

2450
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:39,178
But that lady's a whore.

2451
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,852
- Yeah, you, you fucking bitch.
- No further questions.

2452
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:45,141
<i>"ED". The state was very thorough.</i>

2453
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,523
<i>Frankly, it had a lotto make up for.</i>

2454
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:50,739
We're going to walk on this.
They ain't got no proof.

2455
01:57:50,981 --> 01:57:53,700
<i>At first, the evidence
was mostly circumstantial,</i>

2456
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:57,279
<i>physical proof of the murders
being hard to come by.</i>

2457
01:57:57,362 --> 01:58:00,241
<i>Eventually, they found
the barrels and bodies,</i>

2458
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:02,792
<i>but no fingerprints.
And then, for the first time</i>

2459
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:04,335
<i>in the history of the United States...</i>

2460
01:58:04,411 --> 01:58:07,585
Two 750 cc breast implants.

2461
01:58:07,664 --> 01:58:09,132
<i>"ED"...they used the manufacturer's</i>

2462
01:58:09,207 --> 01:58:11,505
<i>unique serial numbers for identification.</i>

2463
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:15,760
<i>Paul Doyle seemed to embrace
the concept of confession.</i>

2464
01:58:15,839 --> 01:58:17,807
They kidnapped Kershaw,
they tried to kill him.

2465
01:58:17,882 --> 01:58:20,010
<i>I just want to go back to prison.</i>

2466
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:22,095
<i>They used chainsaws to cut them up!</i>

2467
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:24,681
<i>He said no one would get hurt.
They hurt Pepe.</i>

2468
01:58:24,764 --> 01:58:26,437
<i>They hurt him bad. They hurt my friend.</i>

2469
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,234
Manipulator of manipulators.

2470
01:58:28,685 --> 01:58:30,858
<i>"PAUL". Wow. That felt good.</i>

2471
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:33,948
All they got is testimony
from some fucking cokehead.

2472
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,401
<i>"ED". In the end, though,</i>

2473
01:58:35,483 --> 01:58:37,736
<i>all justice really needed
to do was listen to</i>

2474
01:58:37,819 --> 01:58:39,742
<i>the right guy at the right time.</i>

2475
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:41,038
<i>In light of his cooperation,</i>

2476
01:58:41,114 --> 01:58:43,958
<i>Mr. Doyle was given only 15 years.</i>

2477
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:46,787
<i>A sentence for which
he seemed legitimately grateful.</i>

2478
01:58:47,287 --> 01:58:52,088
<i>I once was lost</i>

2479
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:57,006
<i>But now I'm found...</i>

2480
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,926
<i>"ED". Daniel Lugo and Adrian Doorba!</i>

2481
01:59:01,009 --> 01:59:04,229
<i>were found guilty
of double murder, racketeering,</i>

2482
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:06,477
<i>attempted extortion, theft,</i>

2483
01:59:06,556 --> 01:59:08,274
<i>attempted murder, armed robbery,</i>

2484
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:10,523
<i>burglary, money laundering and forgery.</i>

2485
01:59:10,602 --> 01:59:12,730
<i>In fact, the only thing
they weren't found guilty of</i>

2486
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:15,235
<i>was the one thing
they were most guilty of,</i>

2487
01:59:15,523 --> 01:59:17,491
<i>being dumb stupid fucks.</i>

2488
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:20,203
<i>It took the jury only 14 minutes</i>

2489
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:22,076
to sentence them both to death.

2490
01:59:40,131 --> 01:59:42,350
This seems like such a waste.

2491
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:44,848
People's lives.

2492
01:59:45,804 --> 01:59:47,101
You know?

2493
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:50,900
Some people just don't
know a good thing

2494
01:59:50,975 --> 01:59:53,194
when it's staring them in the face.

2495
01:59:57,232 --> 01:59:59,655
<i>"ED". It really is the
simple things in life.</i>

2496
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:03,321
<i>Daniel just wanted to be like everyone.</i>

2497
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,158
<i>Everyone that wants
the American dream.</i>

2498
02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:09,036
<i>All I ever wanted out of life</i>

2499
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,746
<i>was what everyone else had.</i>

2500
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:13,799
<i>Not more.
Just not the less I was used to.</i>

2501
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:16,918
<i>Well, I took a real swing for it,
you know?</i>

2502
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:20,843
<i>And for a while, it was like
I always thought it would be.</i>

2503
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:22,299
<i>I was one of you.</i>

2504
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:24,009
<i>And it felt good.</i>

2505
02:00:24,217 --> 02:00:26,561
<i>People finally saw me like I saw myself</i>

2506
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:28,309
<i>and you can't ask for more than that.</i>

2507
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,974
<i>Maybe I did, though.</i>

2508
02:00:31,182 --> 02:00:34,311
<i>Maybe it got so I didn't want to
be "equal to" anymore.</i>

2509
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,692
<i>I wanted to be "better than.“</i>

2510
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:38,907
<i>And that's a recipe for injury.</i>

2511
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:41,076
<i>That doesn't mean you give up, though.</i>

2512
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:44,371
<i>You rest, you heal and
you get back on that bench.</i>

2513
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:46,740
<i>Life is going to give me another set.</i>

2514
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:48,120
<i>And I am going to rock it.</i>

2515
