00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:36,323
Jessica.

3
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:38,255
What's going on?

4
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:43,552
How you doing?

5
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:47,098
- Love the Caddy.
- Baby, what's up?

6
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,964
- Hi, Turtle.
- You leaving?

7
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,434
- Yeah.
- Damn.

8
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,500
Vince, you need to sign this.

9
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:57,076
- Not now, Turtle.
- It's for Mary at Nike.

10
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:59,840
You want her to shut down
our shoe supply?

11
00:01:59,947 --> 00:02:03,110
- I better sign it. After lunch.
- You better sign it.

12
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:06,948
Don't sign that, Vince. They screwed it up.
They got your eye color wrong.

13
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:09,852
- It's black and white.
- They look brown to me.

14
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:11,754
At least they didn't fuck up your package.

15
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:14,123
What are you talking about?
The poster's a headshot.

16
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:15,456
I'm just saying, shit happens.

17
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:19,659
I heard Warren Beatty sent back
300,000 one-sheets for <i>Heaven Can Wait...</i>

18
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,826
'cause his dick looked too small
in sweat pants.

19
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:24,427
Guy's smart. He looks out for his image.

20
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,233
Incoming. Check this out right here.

21
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,605
Excuse me, did you drop these?

22
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,044
- Turtle.
- Vince. Eric.

23
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:35,115
How you doing?

24
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,241
You guys going to
that Motorola party tonight?

25
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,319
No, we can't.
We got Vince's premiere tonight.

26
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,650
- We're busy.
- My gosh, that's right.

27
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:45,316
- Why aren't we on the list?
- 'Cause you're not hot enough.

28
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,327
Good luck. Call us.

29
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:49,555
- See you.
- Bye.

30
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:53,030
- How come nobody says hi to me?
- How come you don't say hello to them?

31
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:57,001
- 'Cause that ain't how it works, asshole.
- Yeah, how does it work?

32
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:58,293
Fucking models.

33
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,930
If they were any good,
they'd be working in New York.

34
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,373
Speaking of New York,
are we going to that reunion?

35
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:04,466
Who cares?

36
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:07,206
The only people I talk to from high school
are right here.

37
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:11,683
- We gotta go. 10-year reunion, baby.
- We? You weren't even in our class.

38
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,882
- I hung out with a lot of those kids.
- Hang out with them?

39
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,220
You sold them weed in the parking lot,
and you were already, like, 40.

40
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:20,691
Why don't we meet up with those girls
after the show?

41
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:22,989
- Yes.
- What are you hooking him up for?

42
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:24,064
What the fuck?

43
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:26,564
Poor guy's in recovery,
he needs a night out.

44
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,135
- No, E. Fell off the wagon.
- What are you talking about?

45
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:32,728
- I know you've been calling Kristen, E.
- No. Is it true?

46
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,868
No, it's not true.

47
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,270
Just say it's over.

48
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:37,776
- Please.
- It's over.

49
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:40,039
'Cause we don't want
to tell you she's a bitch...

50
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:43,913
then two weeks later, you get back together
and you're mad at us for saying it.

51
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,483
- It's over.
- She's a bitch!

52
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:50,850
- She is a bitch.
- You know what I'm saying?

53
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,733
- How's my head?
- You look fine.

54
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:06,864
- What are you so worried about?
- It is my movie, too.

55
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:10,068
- I forgot. Give us your line again.
- All right.

56
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:14,613
I'm out of here, motherfuckers.

57
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,813
- He nails it every time.
- I love it.

58
00:04:20,054 --> 00:04:22,887
- So the head's good, though, right?
- It's thick, Drama. Thick.

59
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,891
That Rogaine,
that shit's liquid gold, baby. Let's do this.

60
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:28,860
Johnny, let Vince go out first.

61
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:31,188
Yeah. Go for it, Vince.

62
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:54,586
Pavarottis are out tonight, E?
Check out the tits on the girl from <i>Extra.</i>

63
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:58,485
Go find out where Ali's sitting.
Make sure she's not within 10 rows.

64
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:01,755
- And don't mug for the cameras, either.
- Come on.

65
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:11,401
Get a picture of me and my brother.

66
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,170
- You used to be on that show, right?
- I've been on a bunch of shows.

67
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:19,439
- Vince's brother, what's your name?
- Johnny Chase, he steals the film.

68
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,209
One more, guys.

69
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:38,123
Nice to see you.

70
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:40,723
- How're you doing?
- How are you?

71
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,597
- Loved the movie.
- Thank you.

72
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,036
How do you think it went?

73
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:52,840
- Off the charts. You kidding? They loved it.
- Nice.

74
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:56,245
- Vince, how are you? Great job.
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

75
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,114
- Can I take a picture with you?
- Yeah, okay.

76
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,888
How long do we have to be at this?

77
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,686
We gotta hang out for a little while,
have a couple drinks, mingle a little bit.

78
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,886
We'll leave in a little while.
Go take that picture with Alan.

79
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:08,962
Alan who?

80
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:11,327
Alan, the guy that financed
the fucking movie, Vince.

81
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:14,959
- The one with the hot daughter?
- No, he's got the gay son. He's over there.

82
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,833
Do it. Let's get a drink,
I'll meet you here in a few minutes.

83
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:21,567
Every year, after every premiere,
Vince likes to go night swimming.

84
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:23,241
That was you?

85
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:36,881
Excuse me.

86
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:39,658
- Eric.
- Ari. How you doing? What's up?

87
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,627
- What's Vince doing?
- He's over there talking to some people.

88
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,629
Why hasn't he read <i>Matterhorn?</i>

89
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:47,230
The movie just ended, let him enjoy himself.

90
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,892
No. What does he do all day?

91
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:49,991
- Today?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,230
He worked on his short game.

93
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, he's got one job,
to read fucking scripts.

94
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:57,043
- He can't do it?
- Go tell him that, he's standing right there.

95
00:06:57,144 --> 00:07:00,341
- What are you talking to me for?
- Tuesday, Courtside, all right?

96
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,541
If you get him to read... Wait for it.

97
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,210
Get him to read <i>Matterhorn,</i> okay?

98
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,255
I will take care of it.
Relax, have fun tonight, will you?

99
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,187
- What does he need?
- What do you need?

100
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,417
I'm on ass patrol.

101
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:15,051
I got a six-pack, one of them
kind of looks like Kristen.

102
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:17,722
- What are you, an asshole?
- I'm just saying, revenge fuck.

103
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:20,664
I'm gonna revenge fuck someone
'cause she looks like my ex?

104
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:21,995
I would.

105
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:24,900
More importantly,
this girl told me she loves to give head.

106
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:28,497
I know you desperately need it,
so I'm gonna make sure she gives it to you.

107
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:31,476
I'm sure some girl told you
she loves to give head, too, right?

108
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:33,341
No, I told her I loved Derek Jeter first.

109
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,608
- Then she told me that.
<i>- Legally Blonde,</i> 2 o'clock.

110
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,549
Boy, here she comes.

111
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:44,384
- Where's Vince? I can't find him anywhere.
- I don't even think he came tonight.

112
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:47,927
Do not fuck with me, Turtle.
Just tell me where he is.

113
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:50,730
Are we gonna do this again tonight?

114
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,491
Go fuck yourself, Eric.

115
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,359
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't do anything.

116
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,301
Come on, E. Let's go, these girls are hot.

117
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:01,033
They won some KROQ premiere contest.
They want to party...

118
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,803
but first they want to meet Vince,
so you gotta hook it up.

119
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:05,708
Could you get laid without Vince?

120
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:07,848
Do I give a fuck? That's the answer.

121
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,475
So, you all live here together?

122
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:47,247
- I live in the guest house.
- I'm a guest. Show me.

123
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,993
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

124
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:59,196
You just kind of remind me of somebody,
it's freaking me out a little bit.

125
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,767
Come on. You can tell me about her.

126
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,564
Are you really Vince's brother?

127
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:08,699
- You all don't look very much alike.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

128
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,737
Because I have a lot less body fat.

129
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,511
- Come on, what do I gotta do to get a little?
- Beg.

130
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:19,311
I'd get on my knees, but I'd drown.

131
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:23,153
Look, it's not like I don't think you're cute...

132
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:27,125
but I'm just still hoping
I'm gonna be the one that fucks Vince.

133
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:30,256
Sweetheart, look around, Vince is gone.

134
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,694
So is your sister and your best friend.

135
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,031
Come on, just make out with me,
I'll show you where Vince eats breakfast.

136
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:54,248
Morning, Jorge. How you doing?
Watch this shot. Are you ready?

137
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,914
Roberto, sorry about that, buddy.

138
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:02,761
Morning, Blanca.

139
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:05,590
- Morning, guys.
- What's up?

140
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:09,567
- How did it go last night, boy?
- What do you want, a play-by-play?

141
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,366
- I fucked like a puma.
- My girl went nuts, E.

142
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:14,201
First second, juggling the speed bags...

143
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:17,243
next, she was telling me
how her uncle used to watch her shower.

144
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,175
- That's great.
- Don't sweat it.

145
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,304
I gave her Vince's jeans. She left thrilled.

146
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:22,541
What's up, fellas?

147
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:24,879
Vince, you gotta read this thing.
Ari's going nuts.

148
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:26,577
I know, he just called.

149
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,552
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.

150
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:32,282
- I didn't like it.
- Fuck it, then. What do I gotta read it for?

151
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,925
I don't know.
You might see something different.

152
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,691
- You see any parts for me, E?
- I'm not gonna see anything different.

153
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,893
What you like, I like.
I mean, look at last night.

154
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:46,462
- You liked that and I think we got a hit.
- A hit? We got a monster, Vince.

155
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,768
Yeah, I liked it, but you still read it.

156
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,241
- No.
- You're kidding me, right?

157
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:55,475
I didn't even know who the killer was
until I saw the fucking thing.

158
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:59,552
- Unbelievable.
- Call Ari and cancel the meeting.

159
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,780
- What meeting is that?
- Warner's.

160
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:05,221
- I told him I'd go meet the French director.
- Can I ask you a question?

161
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:08,351
Why would you agree to a meeting
when you haven't read the script?

162
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:12,125
Because at the time I agreed,
I still believed I'd read it.

163
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,428
All right, cancel the meeting.

164
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:17,298
You know what? I'll take the meeting.

165
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:20,400
It's rude to cancel at the last second.

166
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:23,607
- What are you gonna talk about?
- I'll listen.

167
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:27,413
That's what good actors do, they listen.
Right, Johnny?

168
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,305
What?

169
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,260
The guy's a legend, Vince.
Just talk about his old movies, he'll love it.

170
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:49,267
- What's he done?
- How the fuck would I know?

171
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:52,600
Vince will love that. He'll love that.

172
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:54,472
All right, thanks.

173
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:58,734
That was Black Hack.
Says he's got a dog that'd be perfect for us.

174
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:00,813
- We're getting a dog?
- A guard dog.

175
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:03,940
- Sweet.
- Check out the picture, he's beautiful.

176
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:07,886
He's got a great body, E.
Look at those calves.

177
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,218
This isn't a guard dog,
this is a fucking lawsuit.

178
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:12,951
- Forget it.
- I was talking to Vince, all right?

179
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,151
This is house business.

180
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:16,752
You don't live in the house,
so it's not your business.

181
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:19,058
- Yeah.
- Fuck you guys.

182
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:22,296
- You did move out on us.
- I live in the guest house.

183
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:24,632
Which in my mind is still totally fucked up.

184
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:25,762
Here we go.

185
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,965
You never asked
for the guest house, Johnny.

186
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:30,099
I shouldn't have to ask. I'm your brother.

187
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,202
Half-brother. Vince thought
you were his cousin till, like, 14.

188
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:35,941
You know what?
For two years, you guys mooched off me.

189
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:39,348
- You ate my food, you fucked my fall-out.
- Your what?

190
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:42,684
My <i>Melrose Place</i> fall-out pussy.
And what's my payback?

191
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:44,654
Sharing a bathroom with this fat fuck.

192
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:47,989
Do you need to go at my weight,
you balding, unemployable douche bag?

193
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:50,187
Johnny, you're family, I need you close.

194
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:53,630
You'll thank me when Charles Manson
breaks in and slits Eric's throat...

195
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,758
while we're safe with...
What's the dog's name?

196
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:57,632
- Arnold.
- Arnold?

197
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:00,239
I like that. Get the dog, Turtle.

198
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,433
Quick decisions. That's why you're a star.

199
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,635
Do what you have to,
but I don't pick up dog shit.

200
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:05,938
It's the wrecking crew.

201
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,310
Turtle, I hooked you up
with my friend, right?

202
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:11,414
That shit ain't free,
pay him his fucking money.

203
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:14,885
- Come on, you know I'm good for it.
- Drama, let's tee up, man.

204
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:18,355
You know, I'm working on that thing.
But, yeah, I could do it.

205
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,287
Guys, I'll catch you later.

206
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,741
No use beating yourself up over it.

207
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,073
If you didn't like the guy,
you didn't like the guy.

208
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:41,739
He kept asking me questions,
I didn't know what he wanted.

209
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:45,079
- French, can't understand a word they say.
- All directors are pricks.

210
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:47,847
He didn't even see my last two films.
What's that about?

211
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:49,546
You didn't read his script.

212
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,420
How can you compare
watching a DVD with reading a script?

213
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:55,962
Vince, don't even worry,
it's probably a dumb movie anyway.

214
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:58,895
- What's up, Ari?
- I got some feedback from the frog director.

215
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,057
Yeah, listen...

216
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,963
<i>- He loved you.</i>
- Really?

217
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:05,766
<i>They wanna wrap you up in a scarf</i>
<i>and give you a baguette.</i>

218
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:09,000
They wanna throw $4 million at you.

219
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,767
You're kidding.

220
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,172
<i>Are you smiling?</i>

221
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,646
- Yeah, I'm smiling.
- Can you hear me smiling? Listen.

222
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:17,876
<i>You got my balls tingling, man.</i>

223
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,646
They drive that way
in Tiananmen Square, bitch.

224
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:23,548
<i>- Call me.</i>
- I'll talk to you later, bye.

225
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:28,354
- They just offered me $4 million.
- Holy shit, are you kidding me?

226
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:30,156
- Yes!
- Yeah, baby.

227
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:34,393
- E., what do you think I should do?
- I think you should read the fucking thing.

228
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:40,134
That's 300 bones plus,
and I hit it off the toe.

229
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,366
Next time aim west.

230
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:44,238
I don't need Ed Begley
coming here in his electric car again.

231
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:47,939
That ain't Begley's house.
Pierce Brosnan's got the Spanish roof.

232
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:50,642
I bet Black Hack
can get us a deal on this G5.

233
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,378
How do you fly on a jet
that your weed dealer handles?

234
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:56,421
He don't fly the fucking thing.
He knows brokers.

235
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,514
Guys, give it up, all right?

236
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,061
Vince isn't gonna do some dog-shit movie
just so he can time-share a jet.

237
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:05,063
Who says it's a shit movie?
Sounded like a cool idea to me.

238
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:08,623
This from a guy who thought <i>Guiding Light</i>
was a cool idea four years ago.

239
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:11,829
We listen to you, we'd all be working
for some loser on a soap.

240
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:13,565
I'm up for a soap.

241
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,032
Sorry, Drama.

242
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:18,201
Vince will be a star no matter what.

243
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:20,711
It was pre-destined. The kid's a triple-threat.

244
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:22,873
He's got the look, he's got the talent.

245
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,974
- He's got the head.
- The what?

246
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:29,044
The head, the big head.
You guys telling me you don't know this?

247
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,214
The bigger the head, the bigger the star.

248
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:34,555
- You're such an idiot.
- Bruce Willis, big head.

249
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:38,427
Russell Crowe, big head.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, big head.

250
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,859
Vincent Chase, big, big head.

251
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,062
- How's my head?
- Not so big.

252
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:50,108
But your ears are huge,
if that helps you out at all.

253
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:57,743
- Yo.
- I can't get through it, man.

254
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:00,479
- What's the problem?
- I can't tell if the script sucks...

255
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,215
or if it's just
I got the sound of a jet engine in my head.

256
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:05,848
- No, Vince, G5's whisper quiet.
- Shut up, Turtle.

257
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,221
Keep reading.

258
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:12,022
- Give me that thing. Take that.
- You going for Brosnan?

259
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,862
Three bones, baby, three bones.

260
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,340
- You suck.
- I don't know, it's a cop.

261
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,933
- I've never played a cop. Can I play a cop?
- You can play anything, Vince.

262
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,809
Cop's tough. I did four eps of <i>Blue.</i>

263
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:30,777
The wrong guy could look real stupid
carrying a gun.

264
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:34,945
- And when were you on <i>NYPD Blue?</i>
- I was on <i>Pacific Blue,</i> cock breath.

265
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:36,684
And you know that.

266
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,815
For $4 million, we could buy this house.

267
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:41,120
You only got $2 million for your last movie.

268
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,525
- That's a big bump up.
- What do you think, E?

269
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:45,790
If they're gonna
give you $4 million for this...

270
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,094
they'll give you $4 million
for something you love.

271
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:49,293
What the fuck do you know?

272
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:52,997
Guy does two years at Queens Community,
suddenly he runs this town.

273
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:55,839
It's Ari. Ari, what's up?

274
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:57,637
You get a chance to look at <i>Matterhorn?</i>

275
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:59,939
<i>Yeah, you know what,</i>
<i>I don't really understand it.</i>

276
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:03,777
- You don't understand? Are you kidding?
- I don't know, it's a little confusing.

277
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,578
This is your artistic bar mitzvah, baby.

278
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,812
You're gonna step up,
you're the man in this one.

279
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,718
- Eric hates it.
<i>- Eric hates it, okay.</i>

280
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,451
He says you should
get me $4 million for something I love.

281
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,719
You're an idiot, dude.

282
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:16,295
What did you think of the script? Fuck Eric.

283
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:18,864
- You want to talk to him?
- I don't want to talk to him.

284
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:20,762
I'm not talking to him. No.

285
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,261
Fucking. Ari, what's up?

286
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:28,070
<i>Why don't you and I
<i>sit down and have dinner?</i>

287
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:30,836
- Tonight?
- Yeah, we'll sit down over at Koi.

288
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:34,539
7:30, we'll talk about future plans.
Figure out what's right for us.

289
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:36,137
Okay, cool.

290
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:38,616
All right, I'll see you there.

291
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:43,516
He wants to have dinner with me tonight.
Talk about finding you a new project.

292
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:46,023
I don't always have to be
in the middle of everything.

293
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:47,525
You want us to go with him?

294
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:50,323
What is this, a sweet 16? This is my career.

295
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,863
Let Eric handle it.

296
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,933
Fellas, the puppy's here, baby.

297
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:59,796
How is this dog gonna protect you?
You can't even get him out of the crate.

298
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,340
Relax. Just gotta bond with him,
learn his language.

299
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:05,969
Three days, he'll be taking
chicken out of my mouth. Right, baby?

300
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:11,476
Drama, don't stare at him, retard.

301
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,815
What do you wanna do, Vince?

302
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:18,087
I kind of want to see this dog in action.

303
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,793
Turtle, I'm guessing you want to go...

304
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,489
to that lingerie party
at the Mansion on Thursday?

305
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:26,724
Yeah, what do you guys got in mind?

306
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:37,841
All right, you pansies, let her rip.

307
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,511
Here he comes.

308
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:45,417
Not the nuts.
I'm saving them for Miss August.

309
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:57,120
Hang in there, Turtle.

310
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,897
That sake you're drinking,
my wife and I discovered in Hokkaido.

311
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:04,867
We were visiting Sofia on the set of <i>Lost.</i>

312
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:09,067
That film didn't really capture the place.
Twice as boring in real life.

313
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:11,302
How about you, you dating?
What's going on?

314
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:14,005
I broke up with Kristen.
You know that, right?

315
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:16,638
The little blonde?
I thought she was the one for you.

316
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:18,376
Brunette, actually, but, yeah...

317
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:20,452
I guess she thought
her ex was a better play.

318
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:24,319
Ask me who I'm fucking.
Come on, who am I fucking?

319
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:27,692
- Mrs. Ari?
- Please, come on.

320
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,022
Irina Korova.

321
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:31,830
I don't know who that is.

322
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,764
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue,
she's the cover.

323
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:36,426
She's that Russian chick.

324
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:39,471
Yeah, I think Vince hit that.
Did you ask him first?

325
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:41,267
I'm kidding with you. Relax.

326
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:43,641
Let me ask you something.

327
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,677
Why are you talking
Vince out of <i>Matterhorn?</i>

328
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:48,269
- I didn't talk him out of it.
- What is it, the dialogue?

329
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:51,145
I can get some hack to come in, rewrite it.
No problem, boom.

330
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,811
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- It does matter.

331
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,686
You're part of the team, baby.
I mean, I gotta know what you think...

332
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,384
so I can get you to think
what I think, you know?

333
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:02,256
Okay, I didn't love it.

334
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:05,123
It's <i>Die Hard</i> at Disneyland.
What's not to love?

335
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:08,598
Personally, I don't want to watch
kids blowing up at Disneyland.

336
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,396
Where do you want to watch them blow up?

337
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:13,529
Nowhere. That's the point.
I just read an article in <i>The Times...</i>

338
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,006
<i>The New York Times,</i>
not this shit they got out here...

339
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:17,804
- You read <i>The Times?</i>
- Yeah.

340
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:20,402
- You read <i>The New Republic?</i>
- I've heard of it.

341
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,277
I was reading that.
It's interesting, 'cause what it says...

342
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:26,580
is that you don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

343
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,820
Look, I thought we were gonna sit here...

344
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:31,584
and talk about how we could find a project
that Vince loves.

345
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:33,318
How you and I could work together.

346
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:36,224
How long you been out here, Eric?
How long?

347
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:38,128
Fourteen months.

348
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,756
Fourteen months.
And what were you doing back there?

349
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:42,459
Back on the East Coast?

350
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:45,432
- Managing an Italian restaurant.
- There you go.

351
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:49,201
Now, if I was opening a pizzeria,
then you and I could work together.

352
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,675
Eric, I know you mean well.
You're Vince's friend...

353
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:53,746
you want to protect him
against making a bomb.

354
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:57,646
Bombs are bad, they kill your career, right?
Wrong. Know what kills your career?

355
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,342
Passing on a hit.

356
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:03,149
Ari, don't blame me if you can't get
your client to do what you want him to do.

357
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:04,553
I resent this.

358
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:07,285
I don't have dinner
with people like you. I don't do it...

359
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:08,655
I don't do this.

360
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,626
You think Hugh Jackman calls me and says:

361
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,528
"Ari, love the script,
but I gotta run it past my pizza boy"?

362
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,328
I've been doing this for 15 years, okay?

363
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:17,767
What the hell do you know? Come on.

364
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,499
I know that two years ago you were
the asshole that wouldn't call Vince back.

365
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:25,373
I also know, Ari, if you ever
fucking talk to me like that again...

366
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:28,038
I will slap that grin right off your face.

367
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:31,947
You're gonna get street on me now?
Is that what you're gonna do?

368
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:35,218
You know what? Enjoy your dinner.

369
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,855
This sake sucks.

370
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:41,560
Can I get a check, please?

371
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:59,777
- Fucking scared the shit out me.
- What, were you spanking it?

372
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,904
Yeah, I'm jerking off to <i>Sports Center.</i>

373
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:04,950
You are. Look, he was tugging it
to the lady golfers.

374
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,519
- Whatever.
- How was your big dinner with Ari?

375
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,646
I'm going to bed. I'll tell you in the morning.

376
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:12,691
You're not going to bed,
we're going to Vegas.

377
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:14,885
What are you talking about? We're flying out
for the reunion tomorrow.

378
00:22:14,994 --> 00:22:17,519
No, we're flying from Vegas,
Black Hack got us a jet.

379
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,688
I'm not going to Vegas.

380
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,130
Don't be a pussy.
The Maloofs are hooking us up.

381
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:23,464
Vince is upstairs right now
emptying out the safe.

382
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:26,231
Put $10 on red,
and I'll see you guys in New York.

383
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,469
Should we tell him? We should tell him.
Kristen's fucking Vince Vaughn.

384
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:33,869
What are you talking about?

385
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,813
She's back with what's his face,
the restaurateur.

386
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:41,182
She was in the middle of 40 Deuce
with her hand down Vince Vaughn's pants.

387
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:44,620
- She had her hand down his pants?
- Both of them.

388
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:48,384
Vince Vaughn? That puffy motherfucker.

389
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:52,328
No, bro. He didn't look puffy at all.
He was looking real good.

390
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:55,833
Yeah, it was like <i>Swingers</i> Vince Vaughn,
not <i>Old School</i> Vince Vaughn.

391
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:57,459
It was like new school Vince Vaughn.

392
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,403
He looked like he'd been working out
with a personal trainer...

393
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,371
probably a nutritionist, too.

394
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:05,401
What?

395
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,775
You're the worst fucking actor
I've ever seen.

396
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,110
- You indicating motherfucker.
- What? What did I do?

397
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:12,207
- We had him.
- And how is this funny, anyway?

398
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:14,309
Look, I'm shaking. I feel like I'll throw up.

399
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,115
- You deserve it.
- Yeah, why's that?

400
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:19,385
You broke the rule:
No girlfriends, no commitments.

401
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,388
Fellas, I need to talk to E.

402
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:24,122
Please, Vince, talk to the guy,
he's being a little bitch.

403
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,664
Yeah, payback's gonna be a bigger bitch.
You'll see.

404
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,893
Guys, give me a second, all right?

405
00:23:29,735 --> 00:23:33,466
I just talked to Ari.
He said you threatened to beat him up.

406
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,173
Yeah, the guy's a real prick, Vince.

407
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:39,409
He's my agent.

408
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:41,912
You can't go around town
threatening people, E.

409
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:45,347
- We're not back in high school.
- He called me "pizza boy."

410
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:48,147
What, you were
the night manager at Sbarros, weren't you?

411
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:51,087
You know what, fuck you, too.
How about that?

412
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,216
Okay, so Ari's an asshole.
What do you want me to do, fire him?

413
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:55,851
Yeah, that's what I want you to do.

414
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:58,055
I want you to call him right now
and fire him.

415
00:23:58,164 --> 00:23:59,222
All right.

416
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,560
What are you doing?

417
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,638
Put the phone down, asshole.
What's wrong with you?

418
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:10,197
- What's wrong with you?
- Look at you, you're ready to fire your agent.

419
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,006
This is your life, your career.
You care about that at all or what?

420
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:16,604
I care. It's just this shit is hard.

421
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:20,117
Picking movies, I can't do that. I'm an actor.
Let me act like an actor.

422
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:22,483
Why don't you act
like you know what the fuck is up?

423
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,614
What are you saying? You want me
to make your decisions for you?

424
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,558
I don't know, I can't decide. Yeah.

425
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:32,423
Jesus Christ. Do you know where I'd be
if I had your face?

426
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:34,466
Yeah. Well, you don't.

427
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:38,261
Look, should I do the movie or not?

428
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,372
You know what I think?

429
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:43,806
The script's a piece of shit
and I don't think you should do the movie.

430
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,276
Okay. That's that.

431
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:51,214
I wanted to take some time off
just to chill anyway.

432
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:55,447
Come on, Vince. Who you kidding?
You've been chilling for three months.

433
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:59,491
Yeah, but I was all stressed those months.
Now I'm just gonna chill.

434
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,122
- Whatever.
- Come on, we'll talk about it in Vegas.

435
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,562
I'm not going to Vegas.

436
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,425
What do you mean
you're not going to Vegas?

437
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:12,299
- I'm not gonna go.
- Come on, we'll have a blast.

438
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,202
We got <i>The Real World</i> suite at the Palms.

439
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,935
- No, I'm not gonna go.
- Yeah, me neither.

440
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:19,341
Those guys were kind of psyched to go,
but fuck it.

441
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:23,381
- Maybe we'll bag the reunion, too.
- I'm not bagging the reunion.

442
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:27,914
- You'd go without me?
- Yeah, I'd rather go without you.

443
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,519
- Fuck you.
- I'm not trying to be an asshole...

444
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:33,353
I'm just saying,
you go and it turns into the Vince show.

445
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:35,518
I know what's going on.

446
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:38,362
You're just afraid
I'll fuck that little Asian chick...

447
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:40,455
you used to chase around.
What was her name?

448
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:41,965
Sarah Lum.

449
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,735
- I don't care about Sarah Lum.
- Dim Sum Lum.

450
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,304
Don't call her that.

451
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:48,765
All right, I'll go.

452
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:52,977
- Your passive-aggressive shit got me.
- All right, we leave for the airport at 3:00.

453
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,412
- And don't even look at Sarah Lum.
- You're just gonna have to tell her.

454
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,107
This is my no-fly zone.

455
00:25:58,217 --> 00:26:00,879
If she enters my airspace,
she's going down.

456
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:04,354
Your airspace?

457
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:11,319
Check it out, fellas. Jacket still fits.

458
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,625
Turtle, where did you pack
the Bose headsets?

459
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:14,791
What Bose headsets?

460
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,425
The ones I told you to pick up
for the flight yesterday.

461
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,731
You didn't tell me
to pick up any Bose headsets.

462
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,933
Yes, I did.
I told you to go to the Bose store...

463
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:25,237
and pick up four fucking pairs
of Bose headsets.

464
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:27,403
Vince wants to listen to music
on the flight...

465
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:30,505
he doesn't want to hear you
jabbering in his ear. Now fucking go.

466
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,607
- Jesus, what got into you?
- Just fucking go!

467
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:36,484
- Meet us at the airport.
- What a bunch of bullshit.

468
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:44,620
Headsets? I'm only getting three.

469
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,392
We'll be bumping Biggie,
you'll be humming show tunes.

470
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,798
What was that about?
I don't want any headsets.

471
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,961
The guy thinks I'm the boy
for this sound shit?

472
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:55,507
You also don't want to be
driving around in a car that has that on it.

473
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:04,409
That's a good one.

474
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:09,244
Laugh it up, Drama, you're next.

475
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,489
It's Ari, talk to him.

476
00:27:16,562 --> 00:27:18,621
- Hello?
- Hello, Eric.

477
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:23,296
- I'd like to talk to Vince.
- Yeah? He'd like you to talk to me.

478
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:29,330
Okay, player,
tell him Colin Farrell took <i>Matterhorn.</i>

479
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,773
Fuck you!

480
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,908
What did he say?

481
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:41,449
Colin Farrell's doing <i>Matterhorn.</i>

482
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:46,788
He's good.

483
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,029
I hope you know
what you're doing, pizza boy.

484
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,121
