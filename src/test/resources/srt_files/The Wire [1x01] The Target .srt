1
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:28,352
-So, your boy's name is what?
-Snot.

2
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,495
-You called the guy Snot?
-Snotboogie, yeah.

3
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,161
"Snotboogie."

4
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,433
He like the name?

5
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,835
-What?
-Snotboogie.

6
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:45,542
This kid whose mama went to the trouble
of christening him Omar lsaiah Betts?

7
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,206
You know, he forgets his jacket...

8
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,685
so his nose starts running,
and some asshole...

9
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,417
instead of giving him a Kleenex,
he calls him "Snot."

10
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,392
So, he's "Snot" forever.

11
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,088
Doesn't seem fair.

12
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,063
Life just be that way, I guess.

13
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,471
So who shot Snot?

14
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,267
I ain't going to no court.

15
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,248
Motherfucker ain't have
to put no cap in him though.

16
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,376
Definitely not.

17
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,319
He could've just whipped his ass,
like we always whip his ass.

18
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,413
-I agree with you.
-He gonna kill Snot.

19
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,391
Snot been doing the same shit
since I don't know how long.

20
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,962
Kill a man over some bullshit.

21
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:42,361
I'm saying, every Friday night...

22
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,337
in the alley behind the cut-rate,
we rolling bones, you know?

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,101
All the boys from around the way,
we roll till late.

24
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,699
Alley crap game, right?

25
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:54,878
And like every time,
Snot, he'd fade a few shooters.

26
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,913
Play it out till the pot's deep.
Then he'd snatch and run.

27
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:03,548
-Every time?
-Couldn't help hisself.

28
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,290
Let me understand you.

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,688
Every Friday night,
you and your boys would shoot crap, right?

30
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,265
And every Friday night,
your pal Snotboogie...

31
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:17,002
he'd wait till there was cash on the ground,
then grab the money and run away?

32
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,201
-You let him do that?
-We catch him and beat his ass.

33
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,298
But ain't nobody ever go past that.

34
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,406
I gotta ask you.

35
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:31,117
If every time Snotboogie
would grab the money and run away...

36
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,586
why'd you even let him in the game?

37
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:35,881
What?

38
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,651
If Snotboogie always stole the money,
why'd you let him play?

39
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:43,525
Got to. This America, man.

40
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,331
-Guess what he says.
-What?

41
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,302
"Gotta let him play, this America."

42
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,629
No fucking way.

43
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,732
-Would I make it up?
-He give you the shooter?

44
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,004
Three Newports and a Grape Nehi
he's grand juried.

45
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,047
It's down, Bunk.
Barksdale's in Part 1 2, right?

46
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,612
Project murder, Westside.

47
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,911
-Which one, now?
-Never mind.

48
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,620
Gonna sit in on it for a bit.
Where you gonna be?

49
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,691
I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan,
then I'm going to the office.

50
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,955
-Don't answer no phones, Bunk.
-Yeah, yeah.

51
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,526
And is that your signature
on that photo array card?

52
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,156
Yes.

53
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,795
And those are your initials as well,
next to the photo you identified?

54
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,202
Yes.

55
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:11,037
Mr. Gant, do you see the man you identified
from that photo array card...

56
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,573
sitting in the courtroom today?

57
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,888
He's right there.

58
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,032
For the record, the witness
has identified the defendant...

59
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,724
D'Angelo Barksdale.

60
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,265
-Your witness.
-Thank you.

61
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,168
Just one question, Mr. Gant.

62
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:44,141
Have you ever seen this young man
before the day in question?

63
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:51,008
-No.
-No further questions, your honor.

64
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:56,951
You're excused, Mr. Gant.
Call your next witness.

65
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,151
State calls Nakeisha Lyles, Your Honor.

66
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,172
Do you promise to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

67
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:18,211
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

68
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,472
I do.

69
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:26,449
-Ma'am, can you state your name, please?
-Nakeisha Lyles.

70
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,688
-And are you employed?
-Yes, I am.

71
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,157
-And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles?
-I'm a security guard.

72
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:38,458
And were you employed as a security guard
on May 4, the day of the shooting?

73
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:42,367
-What were your duties on that date?
-I was in the booth of 221 .

74
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,532
And is that the guard booth in the lobby
of the Fremont Avenue high-rise?

75
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:49,666
Yes.

76
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:53,711
And you're behind bullet-proof glass,
with a clear view of the lobby?

77
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,746
-Yeah.
-Good.

78
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,318
Now, Ms. Lyles, I know
this may be difficult for you...

79
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,149
but can you tell us what you saw?

80
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,547
A man, you know,
he was waiting for the elevator...

81
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,619
and when another man
just starts beating on him...

82
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,561
and like, the one man,
he got knocked down--

83
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,929
-The victim got knocked down?
-No, the man with the gun.

84
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,696
The man who was knocked down had a gun.

85
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:21,174
And do you see that man
in the courtroom today?

86
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,972
Nope.

87
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,046
Excuse me?

88
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,312
He ain't here.

89
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,757
You don't....

90
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,695
You testified.

91
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,364
Ms. Lyles, do you remember
when Detective Barlow...

92
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,403
showed you this photo array?

93
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,301
-Yeah.
-Good.

94
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,039
I call your attention to your initials
which identify this photo...

95
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,373
as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard.

96
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,972
Did you write your initials
above that photograph?

97
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,084
He ain't the one that did the shooting.

98
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,254
But you identified him.

99
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,952
That's 'cause
he looked like the boy that did it.

100
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,929
See, the one that did it,
I saw him come in the building a week later.

101
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:22,432
You saw someone else
you thought did the shooting?

102
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,737
Right, a week later.

103
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,873
Ms. Lyles, when you spoke
with the detectives...

104
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,273
you never said anything about--

105
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,039
I tried. I called Detective....

106
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:41,554
Yeah, Detective Barlow on May 13th at 2:00.

107
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,848
-But he didn't call me back.
-Nicely done.

108
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,119
-You called Detective Barlow?
-Yeah, twice.

109
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,065
Yeah, I wrote it down in the log.

110
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,194
-I need a price for pressure-treated.
-$14.

111
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:00,440
That's the price that
you were going to quote me?

112
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,372
Do you feel that, Mikey, do you feel it?

113
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,138
'Cause I swear to God
that is my fucking dick in your ear.

114
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,475
-That's nice.
-Hang on, you fucking thief.

115
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,007
What's up?

116
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,084
-You been down the hall lately?
-What?

117
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:14,580
Your case just hit the wall.
Barksdale's crew, they turned it.

118
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,619
Two eyewitnesses and a statement.
No fucking way, pal.

119
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,888
You listen to me, you little shit,
there is no way in hell I am paying that.

120
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,492
No.

121
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,294
You use my goddamn car
to chauffeur that dusty bitch around.

122
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,369
-Yo, ease up.
-You don't understand.

123
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,304
-I did it for that man and he do this.
-Getting heated ain't gonna help.

124
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,639
-Greggs, what's your bird saying?
-It ain't what she says.

125
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,870
Yeah? What do you say?

126
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,540
I say we wait, shithead.

127
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,452
-That's him.
-All right, easy, girl.

128
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,485
-Yo, Herc, you got that?
-Yeah, we see.

129
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,855
-Are the uniforms on the horn?
-They're on hold.

130
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,190
-That's Ghost.
-All right, good, Tiff.

131
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,456
Now tell me what I'm seeing, girl.

132
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,862
-He gonna get little Mike.
-Then what?

133
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,998
Mike come back with the money.

134
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,106
Wait on the drop,
take the car when it's deep in the block.

135
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,335
-I don't want no foot chase.
-Copy.

136
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:13,837
Got it.

137
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,374
Go, go, go. The driver's mine.

138
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,914
Get the house on the left.

139
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,751
Get down. Get on the ground.

140
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,225
Get up.

141
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,419
-Put your hands behind your head.
-Get your hands up.

142
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,293
Shut the engine.
Get that motherfucker around the corner.

143
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,162
Hand the keys out.
Drop the keys out of the car.

144
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,396
Drop them now. Get out of the car.

145
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,730
Get down right here, right here.

146
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,042
Passenger, put your hands
out of the car window.

147
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,808
Both hands out of the car window.
Use your right hand, open up the car door.

148
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,007
Slowly. Step out of the car.

149
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,853
Down on the ground.

150
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,092
That's it, take his ass to jail.

151
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,296
-You got him, Carv?
-I got him.

152
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,158
-Look at this shit.
-Cross your legs.

153
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,803
Look at this.

154
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,535
You see what he did?
Do you see what he did?

155
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,943
Why he throw the gun on my car?
Shit gonna scratch the paint.

156
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,676
-Stay in the car.
-Tell him to leave my car be.

157
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,845
-Stay in the fucking car.
-That shit just ain't right.

158
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,149
Whatcha doing with something like that?

159
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,721
What you got here?

160
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,327
You should've seen
the way this bitch was looking at me, Kima.

161
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,297
Ugly little fucker almost shit his pants
he was so scared.

162
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,894
Right?

163
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,346
Two guns, remember?

164
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,350
-Two?
-It's all good, Kima, ease up.

165
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,952
All rise.

166
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,691
Part 1 2 of the Circuit Court
of Baltimore City is now in session.

167
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,129
Be seated.

168
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,936
Madame Forelady,
you have a unanimous verdict?

169
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,809
As to the defendant D'Angelo Barksdale...

170
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:27,003
how say you to the charge of murder
in the first degree?

171
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,013
Not guilty.

172
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,684
How say you to the charge of murder
in the second degree?

173
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,276
Not guilty.

174
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,651
Yeah.

175
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,690
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Be seated.

176
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,591
It's you, daddy, yeah, that's right.

177
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,224
-At least you made them work for it.
-Be seated.

178
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,401
The jury is to be thanked
for its services in this case.

179
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,270
Deputies will return
defendant Barksdale to pre-trial...

180
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,774
for processing prior to his release.

181
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:08,445
Think I give a fuck?
I'll be chalking you off one night.

182
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,982
-You have a nice day.
-Yo, Stringer, let's go.

183
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,895
Detective?

184
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,832
Detective. Judge asked to speak with you.

185
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,508
-What the hell happened out there?
-We lost.

186
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,079
Were you on this?

187
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,777
-The case?
-Yeah.

188
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,687
No, it was Barlow,
with an assist from McLarney.

189
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,189
If it was Barlow's case,
why are you in court?

190
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,618
No reason.

191
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,525
You just like coming to court
on murders you don't even work?

192
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,153
Just for the thrill of it?

193
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,227
When you start coming with the customers...

194
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,098
it's time to get out of the business.

195
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,536
You shouldn't talk dirty
now that you're a judge.

196
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,870
Now that I'm a judge,
I can say anything I damn please.

197
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:06,240
That Barksdale kid,
he's a cousin to Avon Barksdale.

198
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,772
-Who?
-Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell.

199
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,084
The crew that's been running
Franklin Terrace for a year.

200
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,176
Stringer Bell?

201
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,950
That was him in court
with the legal pad and the glasses...

202
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,049
scaring the living shit out of every witness.

203
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,061
Him and the rest of his crew,
Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum.

204
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,189
-I saw them.
-You think about clearing the court?

205
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,665
On what basis?
It's an open court in a free nation of laws.

206
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,004
I thought it was Baltimore.

207
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,941
Barksdale has five out of seven towers
in the Terrace.

208
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:41,241
That's 10 stairwells in five high-rises,
going 24l7 for dope and coke.

209
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,745
And that's just the towers.

210
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,682
The low-rises,
the avenue corners, they're all his, too.

211
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,549
How do you know this?

212
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,121
-Everybody knows it.
-Define "everybody".

213
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,815
Everybody on the Westside.

214
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,256
Barksdale and Bell, they're the new power.

215
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,992
I mean, they've dropped
10 or 1 2 bodies in as many months.

216
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,227
Beat three cases in court
doing the same thing they just did.

217
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,770
-Who's working on them?
-In the department?

218
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,074
Nobody, really.

219
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,045
We're a little busy
doing street rips, you know.

220
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,272
Community policing and all that.

221
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,545
So, if it's not your case, why do you care?

222
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,911
Who said I did?

223
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,121
One more time.

224
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,532
Stop playing....

225
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,161
Fuck me.

226
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,072
You got submission numbers for the ECU?

227
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,735
-Nope.
-Get them.

228
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,539
-Why me?
-You want the collar, do the submissions.

229
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,607
-You giving me the start?
-It's your turn.

230
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,218
What's the extension for ECU?

231
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,613
Do I look like your bitch?

232
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,353
-We taking the Mercedes?
-No, I promised my girl.

233
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,452
Car's in her name.

234
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,129
Narcotics.

235
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,796
-Lieutenant. Line 2.
-Here you go.

236
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:12,095
-Fuck me, I cannot type.
-Who the fuck can?

237
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,737
Millennium been and gone...

238
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,899
and we still fucking around
with Smith-Corona.

239
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,704
We need to get them computers hooked up.

240
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,676
They promised to train us a year ago.

241
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,907
What would an ass-ignorant motherfucker
like you do with a computer?

242
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,918
-I don't know, trade stocks and shit.
-Jerk off, you mean.

243
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,989
We get them computers hooked up,
Herc'll be deep into some porn...

244
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,185
and Kima'll still be bangin' out
her 24s on that old piece of shit.

245
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,285
-Gotta go upstairs.
-What's up?

246
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,598
Deputy's throwing some kinda piss-fit.

247
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,630
-Major know?
-He's up there now.

248
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,604
With a mouthful of piss, probably.

249
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,136
Like our major don't know
what that tastes like?

250
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,369
It's the chain-of-command, baby,
the shit always rolls downhill.

251
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:55,511
-Motherfucker, we talking about piss.
-Piss does too, think about it.

252
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:59,278
-Shit rolls, piss trickles.
-Downhill, though.

253
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,614
You don't know that for sure--

254
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,188
Not to change the subject
on you two charmers...

255
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,524
but why are there only two ECU numbers?

256
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,617
-Dope and guns.
-Two guns, right?

257
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,095
-That's three.
-Fuck it, Kima.

258
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,099
You want a job done right,
you gotta do it your own self.

259
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,671
He means
that we are an effective deterrent...

260
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,832
on the war on drugs
when we are on the street.

261
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,537
-Fucking motherfuckers up, right?
-Indeed.

262
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,044
Fuck the paperwork.

263
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,809
-Collect bodies, split heads.
-Split them wide.

264
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,247
-The Western District way.
-All right.

265
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,816
You heroic motherfuckers kill me.

266
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,552
Fighting the war on drugs...

267
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,021
one brutality case at a time.

268
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,985
Girl, you can't even call this shit a war.

269
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,357
Why not?

270
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,325
Wars end.

271
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,368
You gonna write that down?

272
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,277
How happy am I to see my pager go off
with your call number?

273
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,780
Smoke 'em if you got 'em...

274
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,078
because this motherfucker
is as ripe as they get.

275
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,383
-We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up.
-I know.

276
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,354
But you had to answer the fucking phone.

277
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,325
-Got to pay down my credit cards.
-Not off him, you ain't.

278
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,993
I leave you alone for a minute,
what do you do?

279
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,998
-All right, I heard you.
-Say the words, Bunk.

280
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,491
-Come on, man.
-Speak to me.

281
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,698
So, you gonna cut and run on the Bunk?
That shit ain't right, Jimmy.

282
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,502
All right, then, this is my case. My file.

283
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,241
This shit comes back a murder...

284
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,041
you ain't gotta do shit
but stand there and laugh at me.

285
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,410
You happy now, you bitch?

286
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,849
This'll teach you to give a fuck
when it ain't your turn.

287
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,853
It ain't even gonna be a murder.

288
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,686
This motherfucker probably came in here
to take a shit and just fell out.

289
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,259
I bet there ain't nothing to it.

290
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,123
-You hope.
-Where you going?

291
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,191
Back to the office, where I belong.

292
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,865
You moldering motherfucker.

293
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,100
Don't even think
about coming back a murder.

294
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,971
Don't even think of that shit.

295
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:11,074
By tomorrow, Lieutenant. Don't fail me.

296
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,760
-Major's pissed.
-He should be.

297
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,660
He didn't have answers
for the deputy's questions.

298
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,699
-About what?
-Avon Barksdale.

299
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,758
Who?

300
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,201
-That's what I said.
-Who the fuck is Avon Barksdale?

301
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,001
According to the right honorable
Judge Phelan...

302
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,602
a Westside player who apparently indulges
in the occasional murder.

303
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,440
Now, as of today,
I never heard of Mr. Barksdale...

304
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,878
but by tomorrow....

305
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:51,216
All right, what do we know?

306
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,088
According to the judge,
he has the Westside high-rises.

307
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,456
The Terrace, mostly.

308
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,559
-Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
-Maybe so.

309
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,871
-It's gotta be tonight?
-Major wants it filed by morning.

310
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,045
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.

311
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,138
Call Andrews at DEA.
See what they have on this mope.

312
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,578
What about Homicide?
lf the guy's doing murders--

313
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,378
Homicide major was in the same meeting.

314
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,477
His people will be scrambling
to get something on paper, too.

315
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,621
I doubt they'll be willing to share,
but you can try.

316
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,296
Barksdale, Avon.

317
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,694
Got a DOB?

318
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,206
-Jay.
-Where the fuck you been all day?

319
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:53,385
Drinking, crack smoking.
Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore.

320
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,387
Okay. Just so you have an excuse.

321
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,624
But your fuck of a partner
picked up the phone, caught a call.

322
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,490
-Yeah, I saw him out there.
-Yeah, what'd he get?

323
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,326
-Decomp in a vacant apartment.
-Fuck.

324
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,195
Nolan's squad was up,
that one should be theirs.

325
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,634
It's a decomp.
Maybe it comes back a natural death.

326
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,764
-You think?
-In the Poe Homes, no fucking way.

327
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,841
Hold up.

328
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,001
Major wants to talk to you
before you roll out.

329
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,308
-What about?
-Fuck should I know, I'm only your sergeant.

330
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,115
Sit the fuck down, Detective.

331
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,592
Something wrong?

332
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,221
Put your ass in the chair.

333
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:54,739
You see these, McNulty, you see them?
These are for you.

334
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,079
These are for you
for as long as it takes me to get even.

335
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,317
Major, what--

336
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,153
Don't "Major" me,
you backstabbing, smartass piece of shit.

337
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,450
What the fuck you doing
over at the courthouse anyway?

338
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,155
Why the fuck are you talking
to some shitbag judge?

339
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,430
These are for you, McNulty.

340
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,937
This one over here
is going up your narrow fucking lrish ass.

341
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,599
And this bad boy over here
is in your fucking eye.

342
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:26,406
I'm upstairs answering questions
about some project nigger I never heard of...

343
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,878
who's supposedly beat
my unit out of 10 murders.

344
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:31,507
Three. They only beat three in court.

345
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,449
I got the deputy asking about 10.

346
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:36,681
No, they did 10,
we only charged them with three.

347
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,553
-You're full of shit.
-Sir, you can check the files.

348
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:44,521
Maurice Scroggins,
Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

349
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,393
The girl they found
in the stairwell in Saratoga...

350
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,967
Collette something or other.

351
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,094
I mean, Major, these guys are real.

352
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:55,436
They beat me up on the Gerard Bogue case
just like they did Barlow.

353
00:22:56,342 --> 00:23:00,073
Scroggins? I don't have an H-file
on Scroggins.

354
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,510
He was last year, summer.

355
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,208
Two in the back of the head,
low-rise courtyard.

356
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,117
Let me understand something.

357
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:12,385
You are having the deputy
bust my balls over a prior-year case?

358
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,650
Is this what I need from you,
you insubordinate little fuck?

359
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,288
Major, look, I'm really sorry.

360
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,498
Phelan, he and l,
we go back a little, you know?

361
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:25,833
He wanted to know what I know
about the crew in his court.

362
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,735
I had to go upstairs knowing nothing...

363
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,934
and explain to the deputy why
he's getting calls about murders...

364
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:32,534
that don't mean a shit to anybody.

365
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,637
Look, sir, this judge, he fucks me up.

366
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,646
He asks me a question and I answer it.

367
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,015
I didn't know he was gonna call anybody.

368
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,823
You have my attention, Detective.

369
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,395
My complete, undivided attention.

370
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,260
-Yes, sir.
-Where you going?

371
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,539
-I'm 8:00-to-4:00.
-No.

372
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,099
-You're typing.
-Sir?

373
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,304
Deputy wants a report
on his desk at 0800.

374
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,974
-A report?
-Clean, no typos.

375
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,883
Make it look right, then put my name on it.

376
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:18,484
Do you want to reference all the murders?
Or should I soft-pedal that?

377
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,821
Fucking horse is out the barn door, right?

378
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,655
Let's try not to make me look stupid twice.

379
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,330
And when you list the cases,
put a little dot next to each one.

380
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:32,029
-Deputy likes dots.
-I'm sorry, Major, really.

381
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,516
Niggers crazy in there, yo.

382
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,611
Eastside, Westside, everybody beefing.

383
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,884
-You ain't got no problem, right?
-Hell no, we deep in there.

384
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,489
Y'all deep down at the courthouse, too.

385
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:01,692
Sitting there, I didn't know
what the fuck would happen.

386
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:02,790
I'm wondering...

387
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,234
how y'all gonna make it
happen for me, you know?

388
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,903
Slick what y'all did
with that security lady though.

389
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,202
That shit was tight, yo.

390
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,911
Let's walk.

391
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:35,067
-What's the rule?
-I know the rule.

392
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,335
Say it.

393
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,096
Don't talk in the car.

394
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,567
Or on the phone
or in any place that ain't ours.

395
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,441
Don't say shit to anybody who ain't us.
But it was just you.

396
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,310
It's your fucking truck.

397
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,951
Don't talk in the car.

398
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,082
What about Marcel?

399
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,388
No, I ain't inviting Marcel.

400
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:36,826
-You want him out?
-I really don't give a shit what you do.

401
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,260
Actually, no.

402
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:41,656
Go down there and make that motherfucker
pay for his drinks.

403
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,430
The bum.

404
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,311
-How you doing?
-What's up, Dee, good to see you.

405
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,108
What up, man?

406
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,581
Yo, you remember the cop
that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin?

407
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:06,953
-Which one?
-White detective, black hair.

408
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,459
-The one that was knocking on all the doors.
-What about him?

409
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,562
He showed up in court to watch.

410
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,127
Word?

411
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,963
What are you talking
to that motherfucker for?

412
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,163
Damn, Dee.

413
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,568
He say anything?

414
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,870
No, just sat in the back.

415
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:37,314
-Yo, what up, money?
-What you got?

416
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,187
Come on, I got something for you.

417
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,565
-You must feel good.
-You know how that go.

418
00:27:56,943 --> 00:28:00,344
-Say what?
-I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke.

419
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,277
I don't know shit about jail.

420
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,815
I don't plan on knowing shit
about jail, you feel me?

421
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,250
You wanna talk about jail though,
you can go sit down next to Marcel.

422
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,084
-He just got home.
-True, you right.

423
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,185
Sit your ass down.

424
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,829
I know it ain't go so good.

425
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,401
But that nigger, Pooh,
he caught me off guard.

426
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:26,699
-He came at me like he was crazy.
-So you shoot the motherfucker?

427
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,569
I'm saying, it was him or me.

428
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,202
You in our building.

429
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,468
You got people on both stairs.

430
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,103
You got more motherfucking people
out in the court.

431
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:40,813
And you got a gun.
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...

432
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,979
how the fuck you end up
shooting this nigger...

433
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,523
in front of the security booth
with all them people?

434
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,559
I'm saying, this nigger was coming at me...

435
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,185
-Iike he was trying to end me.
-This ain't about him.

436
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:51,963
It's about you.

437
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,523
You can't play him out of that lobby.
You can't take a beating neither.

438
00:28:56,636 --> 00:29:00,003
So, the first thing you do,
you get all emotional...

439
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:02,864
you pull your gun out,
you do some dumb shit...

440
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,269
that now we got to work around.

441
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:06,800
I know.

442
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,251
You ain't said
one motherfucking thing I want to hear.

443
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:20,023
You right.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.

444
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,356
You be saying that
all the time and you right.

445
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,496
But I'm saying though, I mean...

446
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,394
the shit y'all pulled with that security lady.

447
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:32,367
It was tight. I mean, that state lawyer.

448
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:35,898
I ain't never seen
a white woman turn so red.

449
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,167
You should've been there.

450
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,438
Yo, man, you family, okay?

451
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:46,546
But that shit cost money.
It cost time and money.

452
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,052
You gonna make that right?

453
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,916
Most def, you gonna see.

454
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,959
When I get back to the tower,
I'm gonna push them niggers.

455
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,626
All right.

456
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,431
Come here.

457
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,635
Don't walk out of here like that.

458
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,538
-You family, all right?
-All right.

459
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,009
-You know it's always love.
-Yeah.

460
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,129
Type quieter.

461
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,666
You didn't have to wait up, love.

462
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,862
Your boy have a heart attack?

463
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,270
No, I went that way...

464
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,569
but Doc Frazier didn't bite
when this popped up.

465
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:48,807
-You seriously fucked.
-Speaking of fucked, why are you here?

466
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,211
I did bad, Bunk. It wasn't my fault.

467
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,317
Really.

468
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,651
Judge Phelan pulled me up
when the jury let the Barksdale kid go.

469
00:30:57,757 --> 00:31:00,783
Him being a judge and all,
I let go of some shit.

470
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,125
He raise a stink?

471
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:07,729
Major got busted by the Deputy Ops
and I gotta have a report by morning.

472
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:12,330
There you go, giving a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

473
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:23,977
Look at them, Cole.

474
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:27,609
Don't it make your dick bust concrete
to be in the same room...

475
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,416
with two noble, selfless public servants?

476
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:31,888
I know I'm proud.

477
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,722
Tell me you put this one down.

478
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,159
Of course not.

479
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,358
Of course your partner here
has to go over to the courthouse...

480
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,765
and lay our business out in front of a judge.

481
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,131
So, you heard?

482
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,705
Major calls me at home,
says I should get in early...

483
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,741
read over your shoulder.

484
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,911
It's got dots.

485
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,813
Deputy loves dots.

486
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,639
Fuck you and your dots.

487
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:01,449
All I did was answer the guy's questions.
He's a fucking judge.

488
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,853
And the Deputy's the fucking Deputy.

489
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:06,254
And he, not the judge...

490
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,452
has what's left of your beshitted career
in his hot little hands.

491
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:10,688
He says so...

492
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,629
you're walking foot
in the Western tomorrow.

493
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:18,101
-Fuck it, I came from Western.
-Where don't you want to go, asshole?

494
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:20,866
Evidence Control? Personnel?

495
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,302
-Headquarter Security?
-The boat.

496
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,041
The marine unit?

497
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,274
Yeah, those diesel fumes,
they make me feel seasick.

498
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,383
That's good, keep it up.

499
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:37,111
I'll go this against $10,
you're riding the boat, midnight shift.

500
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,059
Listen to the man, Jimmy.

501
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,272
Yo, Stringer.

502
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,211
-You here early.
-Yeah, I'm on my game today.

503
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,149
Eggy put out testers?

504
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,679
New deal today.

505
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,652
You going out on point,
picking up business in the Pit.

506
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,559
-What?
-You the man in the low-rises.

507
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,089
The low-rises?
You got Ronnie Mo in the Pit.

508
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,829
Ronnie Mo got 851 this morning.

509
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:29,670
Why you gonna put me in the low-rises
when I had a tower since summer?

510
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,333
Yeah, you had a tower.

511
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:36,643
And you might have a tower again
if you can keep your mind to shit.

512
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,548
This is fucked up.

513
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:43,017
You show us you can run the Pit,
and you'll be back uptown soon enough.

514
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:46,090
My uncle know about this?

515
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,627
What do you think?

516
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,856
-Yo, Bey.
-Yo.

517
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:58,168
Give little cousin here a ride down the way.

518
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,715
-Have your people deal with Daniels.
-Right.

519
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,703
You gonna send your man McNulty?

520
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,638
Tell him about chain-of-command.

521
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:42,145
Tell him yourself, he's dead to me.

522
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:19,575
-Yo, you looking for Ronnie Mo, he uptown.
-I know.

523
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:23,682
You Dee, right?

524
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:29,092
-Wasn't you in the towers?
-Yeah.

525
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:33,623
Why they put you down here, yo?
You mess with the count or something?

526
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:35,761
I killed a nigger.

527
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,269
Last call on green top, last call.

528
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:50,270
Major?

529
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,914
Counting what we got from the DEA,
how much do we have on this guy?

530
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,388
Lieutenant, in my hand,
I'm holding how many pages?

531
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,753
-Four, sir.
-Rawls had a fucking phone book.

532
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,088
What can I tell you,
they got 10 open murder files.

533
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:05,027
If we had 10 shots at him,
we'd have more than a fat file.

534
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,119
I said that upstairs.

535
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,358
They can't put this guy down for a murder...

536
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,198
-so they're getting us to do their work.
-Not getting us, they got us.

537
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,828
They got you, in fact.

538
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,097
Excuse me, sir?

539
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,675
Dawson has the York and Cator case,
that leaves you.

540
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,511
Shit. Look, set something up
with Homicide...

541
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,513
and whoever else
you want from your squads.

542
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,345
-State's Attorney?
-Yeah, we should call them, too.

543
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,386
Fucking shitstorm.

544
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,620
Lieutenant, line 3.

545
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,287
Deputy Ops.

546
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:47,962
Here we go.

547
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,102
Close that for me.

548
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,504
What's the coffee do?

549
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:59,011
Give it that money feel,
so it don't seem so white.

550
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:00,107
Yeah.

551
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,483
Leastways, you got it
on both sides this time.

552
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,913
All right, give me the real.

553
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:12,256
Wait, why are we gonna use real money?

554
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,855
We're not burning
no lemon street chumps here.

555
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,193
Feel me?

556
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,195
I'm down.

557
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:25,607
You down? Johnny's down.

558
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,785
-You got that gig.
-Can I get a one-on-one?

559
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,720
Yo, Poot.

560
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,765
Yo, Wallace.

561
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,637
This the way Ronnie Mo set it up?

562
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,044
-Yeah.
-Man, this is fucked up.

563
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,783
Look, you can't serve
your customers straight up...

564
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,284
after taking they money.

565
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,251
Somebody snapping pictures,
they got the whole damn thing.

566
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,881
See what I'm saying? You get paid...

567
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,824
you send they ass off
around the building, yo.

568
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,863
Then you serve. All right?

569
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:22,259
We gotta start tightening up, man.
No more shortcuts.

570
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,537
-What's your count?
-I'm up $270.

571
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,073
You want to count it.

572
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,438
I mean, I don't know how
you do shit up in the towers.

573
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,345
-But down here, you want to count it.
-Shit.

574
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,817
Y'all niggers been burnt.

575
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,524
That's what you got to say?

576
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,197
This look like money, motherfucker?

577
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:56,629
Money be green. Money feel like money.

578
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:00,338
-That shit look green to you?
-It got a dead fucking president on it.

579
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,769
I don't give a fuck about the president.

580
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,240
-That shit ain't money.
-He ain't no president.

581
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,442
-What you mean?
-Hamilton.

582
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,845
-He ain't no president.
-Nigger, is you crazy?

583
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,551
Ain't no ugly-ass white man
get his face on no legal...

584
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,813
motherfucking tender except he president.

585
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:19,950
This shit happen again, you off the money.
You hear me?

586
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,256
You ain't even gonna be serving no more.

587
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,591
Your ass be out
on the bottom end of Vine street...

588
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,130
sucking on a 40, yelling "5-0".
You hear me?

589
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,591
Get the fuck out of here.

590
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:34,396
That it?

591
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,041
No.

592
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,125
You need to pace that shit, man.

593
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:06,738
-Johnny, man, you hear me?
-I'm cool.

594
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,434
No, man, you gonna fall out...

595
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,203
slamming that shit like that
one of these days, boy.

596
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:20,840
Yo, man, I'm trying
to give you a little game, man...

597
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,477
but you want to pretend
like you know something.

598
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,124
I know a lot, Bubbs.

599
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,451
No, you green.

600
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:33,787
I'm trying to get you brown, man...

601
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,455
but you still green.

602
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,531
You gonna make me brown?

603
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,534
Yo, Bubbs?

604
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,272
Let me do the scam tomorrow.

605
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,073
Come on, man, I'm ready.

606
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,118
Yo, I'm brown.

607
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,585
Shit, man, you ain't even fucking beige.

608
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,679
-Buy-busts.
-Yes, sir.

609
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,754
No long surveillances,
no Kel recorders, no DNRs.

610
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,658
I want to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

611
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,353
That makes sense.

612
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:42,422
Phelan isn't just a judge,
he's a political entity.

613
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:46,329
If he asks for something,
I want to give it to him.

614
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,804
Why is he asking about this Barksdale?

615
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:53,938
He watched his state's attorney
get beat up in his court this week.

616
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:57,139
-Lost a murder case.
-We lose cases all the time.

617
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:00,150
But a judge happens
to be asking about this one.

618
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,377
-Who you using?
-Lead detective?

619
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,489
-Greggs, she's my best right now.
-I know her?

620
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,984
CID for four months.
Came over from Eastern DEU.

621
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:14,621
-Who's Homicide sending?
-That's up to Major Rawls.

622
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,801
I wouldn't be surprised if you get McNulty.

623
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,629
-You know McNulty?
-Not really.

624
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,707
He's the one who mouthed off
to the judge in the first place.

625
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,869
-He talked to the judge?
-Yeah, that's my understanding.

626
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:30,205
So, if he comes over on this,
watch your back.

627
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,441
You need anything, you ask me.

628
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,518
I'll give you all the help I can.

629
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,110
-But no surprises.
-Yes, sir.

630
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:39,756
Keep me briefed.

631
00:42:57,476 --> 00:43:01,071
-Hi, McNulty, City Homicide.
-Is anyone expecting you?

632
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,909
Yeah, Special Agent Fitzhugh, Squad 5.

633
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:06,977
He's expecting me, can l--

634
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,248
-Not without an escort.
-All right.

635
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,448
Agent Fitzhugh to the front.

636
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,037
-Fitz.
-Brother.

637
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,473
-She can spot a bad one.
-Nothing personal, Jimmy.

638
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,477
You know how they are
with security nowadays.

639
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:37,377
I know how they are with locals, yeah.
So, what's up, g-man?

640
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,279
-Good stuff.
-Yeah?

641
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,181
Your man gave us a hell of a case.

642
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:43,378
Comes to informants, Jimmy,
you can pick 'em.

643
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:45,513
He's one of the better Cl's I've ever worked.

644
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,388
-You up on a wire?
-That and more.

645
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:54,223
So, like, he be talking like
he got some type of record deal, you know?

646
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:57,424
-Man, please.
-That nigger.

647
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:02,172
-The pussy has you.
-Jesus Christ.

648
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:05,209
-Pretty fucking great, huh?
-How'd you get this on tape?

649
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,139
That's not tape. That's live, brother.

650
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,112
That's live?

651
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:14,242
Live from a three-story walkup
on Homer Avenue...

652
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:16,081
in the bottoms of Pimlico.

653
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,552
This is going on right now?

654
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:20,124
-As we speak.
-How?

655
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,523
Fiber-optic lensing.
Camera's behind a hole in the drywall.

656
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,960
So small it looks like
a nail might've made it.

657
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,730
Where's the mic?
These motherfuckers sound great.

658
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,301
Two remotes behind
the baseboard heating ducts.

659
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,369
That's about $3,000 of raw
on the table today.

660
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,235
We followed it all the way from New York.

661
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:37,740
You're up in New York on this?

662
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,070
We could be.

663
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:42,076
We're backing into
some Dominicans up there.

664
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:44,516
We could have a Title Ill
on them right now if we wanted.

665
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,210
We could have a Title Ill
on them right now if we wanted.

666
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,010
Wrong war, brother.

667
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,947
Most of the squad's been transferred
to counterterrorism.

668
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:52,319
This thing's the last drug case
we got pending...

669
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,551
and I gotta shut it down
by the end of the month.

670
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:57,287
-You guys are getting out of drugs?
-Yeah, for a while.

671
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,920
We just don't have the manpower
to stay on anything big.

672
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,022
Not since those towers fell.

673
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:05,000
What, we don't have enough love
in our hearts for two wars?

674
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:09,205
-Joke's on us, huh?
-I guess so.

675
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:13,435
Still and all, you give great case, brother.
I wish you could've worked it with us.

676
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,090
Got some Tech Nine over here,
over here, Tech Nine.

677
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:42,239
That's it, here's $20, hook it up.

678
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,199
Two and two.

679
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:46,743
-Hold up.
-What?

680
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:50,076
-Just two and two.
-Come on, man, I ain't got time for this.

681
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,012
-I gave you $20, man.
-You gave me $20?

682
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:53,084
One and a short three.

683
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,277
-So you get, two--
-$7.

684
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:57,412
-Hold up.
-I get $7 back. Come on, man.

685
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,188
Calm down.

686
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:04,017
Hold up, hold up, you fucking me up.
Chill out.

687
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,327
You dropping shit on the ground?

688
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,627
-Hold up.
-I ain't got all day.

689
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:14,237
Come on, man, it's easy. Let's rewind, man.

690
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:18,366
What the fuck is you doing?
Look at this shit. Look, nigger.

691
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,068
That's the motherfucker right there.

692
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:21,645
-Who?
-The white boy right there.

693
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,475
Poot, grab that motherfucker.

694
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:25,780
The white boy.

695
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:28,050
Hold up, man.

696
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,992
Stop that white motherfucker.

697
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:44,459
Yeah, motherfucker, yeah, nigger. Fuck that.

698
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:45,831
What are you doing, man?

699
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:47,668
Calm down, man.

700
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,899
Making me run,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

701
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:52,841
-What, man, why you fucking with me?
-Shit.

702
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:55,742
This the motherfucker right here
with the make-believe money.

703
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:57,314
Seen his ass drop it and shit.

704
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:00,543
-Wasn't me.
-Motherfucker.

705
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,177
It was this nigger, I saw him.
Get the fuck up.

706
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,253
All right, listen, I'm sorry.

707
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:08,748
Fuck that.

708
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,385
What we need to do is,
motherfucker burned us for $30.

709
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,054
We need to take him to Franklin Ave...

710
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,962
and throw his ass right
onto the motherfucking expressway.

711
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:19,865
All right, listen, I'm fucking sorry.
I fucked up, man.

712
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:23,805
-What you got on you?
-Just the $10 I dropped, man, the real one.

713
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:42,425
What's up?

714
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,437
Fuck it.

715
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,369
Hell, yeah.

716
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:08,247
For now, we'll work out of Narcotics,
with Kima keeping the file.

717
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:11,447
We'll copy everything to Ronnie
at the courthouse and your people.

718
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,523
Fine with us.

719
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:15,457
McNulty and Santangelo will work
on the open murders...

720
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,152
see if anything can be manufactured.

721
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:20,288
Kima and my people will do
hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace.

722
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,729
Buy-bust, quick and dirty.

723
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:24,825
We put years over top of
some of these people, we'll roll a few.

724
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:27,370
You're not gonna get
Avon Barksdale or Stringer Bell...

725
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:29,906
or anyone else above the street,
not on street rips.

726
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:32,169
-You don't know that.
-These guys are good.

727
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,440
They're deep and organized.
They've got everyone running scared.

728
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:36,741
What do you suggest?

729
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,948
Surveillance teams,
DNRs, asset investigation.

730
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:42,144
Keep gathering string
till we can find a way in.

731
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,518
Either a wired CI or a Title Ill.
That's what makes this case.

732
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,420
Is that what you told the judge?

733
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:51,493
Okay, so I'm an asshole for that.
But I'm right about this much.

734
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,989
No mics, no wires.
We do this fast and clean and simple.

735
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,567
Then you don't do it at all.

736
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:02,702
Seems to me you all could've had this fight
before calling the State's Attorney's office.

737
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,666
Let me ask you something.
What do we know about Avon Barksdale?

738
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:08,442
What do we know?

739
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:11,973
The guy's owned
all of Franklin Terrace for a year.

740
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,945
What do we have on him right now?
A DOB? A sheet?

741
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,586
A B of I photo?

742
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:20,124
We don't even have
a fucking photo of the guy.

743
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:21,419
Gimme a break, Jimmy.

744
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:25,292
Two days ago no one on this fucking floor
knew this mope's name.

745
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,364
Now he's some kinda criminal mastermind.

746
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,923
Shit, I say we go down to the Terrace
and fuck some people up.

747
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:35,629
You all don't need a prosecutor,
you need a fucking referee.

748
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,038
When you know how
you're playing this, give a yell.

749
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,734
We know how we're playing it.

750
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:42,310
My people are going down
to do some hand-to-hands.

751
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:46,577
Detectives McNulty and Santangelo are
going to the hall to review old murder files...

752
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,948
and try to manufacture a fresh prosecution.

753
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:52,181
As things heat up, I'll go to the deputy
and get us more manpower...

754
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,019
but this case is not going to sprawl.

755
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:57,060
A month from now,
we're all gonna be back at our day jobs.

756
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,421
Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands.

757
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,988
Anything on the murders, you can take
to llene Nathan in violent crimes.

758
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:04,568
I'll clue her in.

759
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,073
Anything else?

760
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:14,402
One last thing:

761
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:18,312
No one does anything at all on the street
without me knowing about it first.

762
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,515
Chain-of-command, Detective.

763
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,617
That's how we do things
down this end of the hall.

764
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:34,164
If she's fucking you on visitation,
take her ass to court.

765
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,630
Not that simple, Bunk.

766
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,463
Judge gives me three weekends out of four,
I still need her to cooperate.

767
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,003
You know, move it around...

768
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:45,267
so when I have to work through a weekend,
she switches with me.

769
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,844
The judge gives me
three weekends but no flex...

770
00:50:47,946 --> 00:50:49,436
I still lose.

771
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:53,147
-You two can't talk this through?
-No.

772
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,679
How is it you always got
the whole world pissed off at you?

773
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,923
You know Daniels? Narcotics?

774
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,755
-What about him?
-He's running this detail.

775
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,832
-Watch your ass then.
-He a snake?

776
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,401
No, he ain't that. But he's a company man.

777
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:14,499
You know, a prospect.

778
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:17,700
Grapevine says the next district
to open up is his.

779
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,399
Shortlist for major?

780
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,203
He's black, he's still young,
he hasn't pissed anybody off.

781
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:26,544
-Shit, he even has a law degree.
-No shit.

782
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:31,054
-University of Baltimore, but still, you know.
-He's gonna fuck this Barksdale thing up.

783
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,888
-How's that?
-Buy-bust?

784
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:38,125
-He's pissing in the wind.
-You already fucked it up, Jimmy.

785
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,188
You made it happen.

786
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:45,630
I feel like that motherfucker
at the end of Bridge On The River Kwai.

787
00:51:45,737 --> 00:51:49,400
-What the fuck did I do?
-The bridge of what?

788
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,470
You ain't seen that movie?

789
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:54,539
I am fucked.

790
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,015
Fucked is me.

791
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,050
God damn it, you gonna make me
go another round.

792
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:07,888
Two more.

793
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:21,196
-It's all in the game.
-I'm saying it was only a couple dollars.

794
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,865
-It ain't the money.
-But we fucked him up so bad.

795
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:25,869
It's the message, Dee.

796
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,309
You can't show no weakness.

797
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:32,546
-Still, I'm saying.
-What?

798
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:44,686
String.

799
00:53:06,818 --> 00:53:10,117
You ain't touched that drink.
You want some company?

800
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:14,385
-I ain't no john.
-Good, 'cause I ain't no whore.

801
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:17,451
I'm not a regular, okay?

802
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:20,156
-I work for Stringer.
-He pay you, don't he?

803
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:23,961
Come on, buy me a drink.

804
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:29,105
-How much?
-$20.

805
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,105
I drink slow.

806
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:38,546
Maybe another time.

807
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,795
-Buy me a drink, honey?
-How about you buy me a drink?

808
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:02,299
Carla. One here.

809
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:29,156
-Where you at?
-Where you think?

810
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,838
-You late for work?
-A little.

811
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:41,042
-How much you got left?
-Girl, please.

812
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,809
-Ten pages and all the footnotes.
-When's it due?

813
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,309
Tomorrow, beginning of class.

814
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,285
Long night for you.

815
00:54:58,262 --> 00:54:59,786
Long night for me.

816
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:06,961
I'll make sure and pick up some coffee.

817
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:20,146
So, I drive all the way down
to Liberty Road...

818
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:23,414
at 2:00 in the damn morning,
on a midnight shift...

819
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,615
I got two murders and a police shooting
going down, to do what?

820
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:29,486
To get a goddamn mouse
out of my wife's bedroom closet.

821
00:55:29,594 --> 00:55:31,084
Can you imagine that shit?

822
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:33,396
So what did you do?

823
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,021
What the fuck you think?

824
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:39,159
I got the mouse out as fast as I could
and drove back to work.

825
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,862
Couldn't do nothing else.

826
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,573
Nadine out of her fucking mind
over this little-ass field mouse.

827
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,610
She's up on the chair and shit
when I come...

828
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,577
Iike some goddamn cartoon.

829
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:53,647
-I mean, how'd you catch the mouse?
-Catch him? I lit his ass up.

830
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:58,388
You shot the mouse?

831
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,457
With your nine?

832
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,883
First shot killed my wife's dress shoe.

833
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:05,220
Got him with the second.

834
00:56:12,637 --> 00:56:13,763
What?

835
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,500
You shot a mouse
with your service weapon?

836
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:18,666
Yeah.

837
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,539
What'd you do with the carcass?

838
00:56:21,646 --> 00:56:23,477
I cleaned it up, you know.

839
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:26,139
I thought about leaving
that little motherfucker...

840
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,081
as a warning to the others.

841
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,191
Fuck me.

842
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:45,492
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm supposed to be early relief.

843
00:56:46,037 --> 00:56:49,803
Jimmy, man,
I gotta change my clothes at least, come on.

844
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,000
I'm gonna do this case.

845
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:56,408
What?

846
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:59,950
I'm gonna do this case
the way it should be done.

847
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,848
It's a buy-bust, Jimmy, get in and get out.

848
00:57:03,054 --> 00:57:04,885
-Fuck that.
-Jimmy.

849
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,794
Let's call it a night.

850
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:42,086
Hi, Bubbs.

851
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:46,258
Thought you was still locked up.

852
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,658
Nope.

853
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,596
How long you been home?

854
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,605
It's been three months.

855
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,166
You don't write, you don't call.

856
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,746
Who's he?

857
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:06,844
A friend.

858
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:11,214
Is he gonna make it?

859
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,357
You still working drugs?

860
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,027
Downtown, yeah.

861
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,835
I got something for you.

862
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:43,448
-Last call.
-Fuck.

863
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:47,682
Found body. 200, Block Amity.

864
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:49,850
I'm a little thin today, boss.

865
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:54,057
The whole squad's a little thin, remember?

866
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:58,428
We're down a man
since your partner got himself detailed.

867
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:03,038
Yeah.

868
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:05,501
I got it.

869
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,215
Jesus.

870
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,396
-How you doing, Bobby?
-Bunk, what's going on, man?

871
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,033
We got one or two shots to the head.

872
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:43,207
No witnesses, no suspects.

873
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,215
You got a .380 casing on the ground there.

874
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:48,410
Buddy, do me a favor, bag that for me?

875
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:51,814
So, who called it in?

876
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:54,021
No one. 21 Post found him.

877
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:58,594
It's a William Gant, 42, no, 43 years old...

878
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:00,829
address on Schroeder.

879
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,161
-You got pictures?
-Yeah, we got them.

880
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,894
Okay, let's roll him.

881
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,870
Mr. Gant, do you see the man
you identified...

882
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,877
sitting in the courtroom today?

883
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,280
He's right there.

884
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:28,280
