1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,669
Jack: Previously on
<i>Hannibal</i>

2
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:03,526
The reason you kept failing
to capture

3
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:05,561
the Chesapeake Ripper is
I already had him.

4
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:09,031
I see the Ripper,
but I don't feel the Ripper.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:13,735
- Franklyn, the lion is not in the room.
- He's, um, he's eating them.

6
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:17,939
The real Chesapeake Ripper is gonna
make sure everybody knows it.

7
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:21,476
I don't think we've ever been alone
in a room together, have we?

8
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:23,879
My name is Mariam Lass.
I'm actually just a trainee.

9
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:26,648
She was a very brave
young woman.

10
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:30,017
<i>Jack, it's Miriam.
I don't want to die like this.</i>

11
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:38,392
The Chesapeake Ripper kills
in sounders of three.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,195
He did his first victims
in nine days.

13
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:44,932
Annapolis, Essex,

14
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:48,267
Baltimore. He didn't kill again

15
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,938
for 18 months. Then there was another
sounder of three in as many days,

16
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,040
all of them in Baltimore.

17
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:56,876
I use the term

18
00:00:56,944 --> 00:01:01,147
"sounders" because it refers
to a small group of pigs.

19
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:04,149
That's how he sees his victims;
not as people,

20
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:07,118
not as prey.

21
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:10,722
Pigs.

22
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,828
Eleven months after the sixth
victim, there was a seventh.

23
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:20,364
Two days later, the eighth is
killed in his workshop.

24
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:24,034
Every tool on the pegboard where
they hung was used against him,

25
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:26,036
and, as with previous murders,

26
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:28,372
organs were removed.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,308
The removal of organs
and abdominal mutilations means

28
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:34,811
someone with anatomical
or surgical know-how.

29
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,513
There...

30
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:39,916
is a distinctive brutality.

31
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,823
An FBI trainee named
Miriam Lass

32
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,492
was investigating private
medical records

33
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:53,195
of all the known victims
when she disappeared.

34
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:55,798
<i>She's believed to be the
Ripper's ninth, but no trace</i>

35
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,733
of her was found...
until recently,

36
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,668
two years later,

37
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,605
when her severed arm was
discovered.

38
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:06,574
Only because he
wanted it to be.

39
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:11,078
True to

40
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:13,615
his established pattern,

41
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:18,419
the Chesapeake Ripper has
remained consistently theatrical.

42
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:22,022
(Baroque opera music)

43
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,569
(Singing in Italian)

44
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,342
It's been too long since you've
properly cooked for us, Hannibal.

45
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,510
Come over and I will cook
for you.

46
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:33,912
I said properly.
Means dinner and the show.

47
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,081
Have you seen him cook?
It's an entire performance.

48
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:40,318
He used to throw
such exquisite dinner parties.

49
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:43,522
You heard me. Used to.

50
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,957
And I will again,
once inspiration strikes.

51
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,494
I cannot force a feast.
A feast must present itself.

52
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,063
It's a dinner party,

53
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,198
- not a unicorn.
- Oh, but the feast is life.

54
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,267
You put the life in your belly
and you live.

55
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:58,536
(She chuckles.)

56
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,938
I believe this young man is
trying to get your attention.

57
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:03,040
Hello.

58
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,241
Hi. It's so good to see you.

59
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,878
- This is my friend Tobias.
- Good evening.

60
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:11,281
How do you two
know each other?

61
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,449
There should remain
some mystery to my life

62
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:16,219
outside the opera.

63
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:19,088
I'm one of his patients.

64
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:23,625
- Did you enjoy the performance?
- I did. I loved it. Every minute.

65
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:28,679
His eyes kept wandering. More interested
in you than what was happening on stage.

66
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,567
Oh, don't say too much.
You must leave something

67
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:35,536
for us to discuss next week.
Franklyn, good to see you.

68
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:38,439
- You too.
- Tobias.

69
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:47,782
Who's hungry?
(She chuckles.)

81
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:08,995
Hello?

82
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:13,265
The victim was found
in a hotel room bathtub.

83
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,568
There were abdominal mutilations
and organ removal on the scene.

84
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,371
Sounds more like an urban legend
than the Chesapeake Ripper, no?

85
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,407
I've had the room sealed.
You'll get it fresh.

86
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,778
Fresh?
Fresh as a Daisy?

87
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,012
Fresh enough for to tell me
whether or not it's the Ripper.

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,981
Then you can go back to class.

89
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,350
Oh, you don't want me
in a classroom.

90
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,220
You want me to wrap my head
so tight around the Ripper

91
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,288
I won't go back to class
until he's caught.

92
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,124
Your bad luck
that you're the best, pal.

93
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:41,325
Expecting another couple
of bodies after this one?

94
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:43,326
If it's the Ripper, yes, I am.

95
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,896
Don't let the Ripper
stir you up.

96
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:49,967
The reason he left you
Miriam Lass's arm

97
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:53,070
is so he could poke you
with it.

98
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,672
Why not the rest of her?

99
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,708
His other victims...

100
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:01,144
He wanted to humiliate in death,

101
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:04,346
like... like a public
dissection. She was different.

102
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:10,319
He was probably impressed
that she was able to find him.

103
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,755
He may be starting
another cycle, Will.

104
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:15,323
The Ripper contacted you

105
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,092
directly.

106
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,195
If he was killing again,
he wouldn't be subtle about it;

107
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:24,065
he would just pick up the phone.

108
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,967
Any more phone calls, Jack?

109
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:28,170
No.

110
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,172
Look, if this is the Ripper,
there'll be at least

111
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:33,340
two more bodies and then nothing
for months, maybe a year.

112
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,609
We'll have a window
of opportunity to catch him

113
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:38,018
and that window will close.

114
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:42,349
The last time the window closed,
I lost the Ripper and I lost Miriam Lass.

115
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,619
I don't intend to do that again.

116
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:51,157
(Police radio chatter)

117
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:55,461
(Camera shutter click)

118
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,368
- Has anyone touched the body?
- For once, local police behaved themselves.

119
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,667
It's fairly evident the man's
dead just by looking at him.

120
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,469
I touched the body.
A lot going on with that body.

121
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,306
Surgery was performed
and then un-performed.

122
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:11,443
Surgery was un-performed with
bare hands, sutures clawed open.

123
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,947
I, uh, I also... did
a little bit of touching.

124
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:18,650
Pieces of him were torn off
from the bed to the bathroom,

125
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,251
like breadcrumbs.

126
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:32,330
Surgery wasn't performed here.
There would be a lot more blood.

127
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,365
If he's moving his victims,
he could be

128
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:37,200
performing the mutilations
in the same transport.

129
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:39,302
Find the car, find the killer.

130
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,273
- He tore open his own sutures.
- It wasn't the kidney.

131
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:47,677
The Ripper already took it with him.
Or her. I'd say him.

132
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,546
- What did he take out of the chest?
- Going for the heart.

133
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:52,781
Probably interrupted.
It's intact. Traumatized,

134
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:55,717
but it's intact.

135
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,486
Everybody out.

136
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:11,532
(Soft ambient pulse)

137
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:39,677
Will: <i>Signs of a struggle
indicate</i>

138
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:43,862
he's suffering from a severe, violent
emergence from deep sedation.

139
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,766
Oh!

140
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:53,505
(Both grunting with effort)

141
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,551
His heart seizes up.

142
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:15,625
I open his chest wall.

143
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:17,394
I spread the ribs.

144
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:22,833
I... I take his heart
in my hand.

145
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,903
Internal cardiac massage.

146
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:40,483
(Breathing shakily)

147
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,418
J--Jack?

148
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,524
This wasn't brutal.

149
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:52,794
The killer wasn't killing;
He was trying to save his life.

150
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:56,798
The Ripper ever do that?

151
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,813
- it's the Chesapeake Ripper.
- (Will): It's not the Ripper.

152
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,316
- There are too many similarities.
- There aren't enough.

153
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:10,485
Knife wounds are cuts,
not stabs.

154
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,620
Anatomical knowledge,
dissection skills, mutilation,

155
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,289
organs removed,
victim clothed, on display.

156
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:18,525
We got 22 signature components
all attributable

157
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,454
- to the same killer.
- Twenty two possible

158
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,195
- signature components.
- It's the Ripper.

159
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:33,206
- Are you sure?
- More or less.

160
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,974
Tell me why you're sure.

161
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,611
The Ripper left his last victim

162
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:40,614
in a church pew using his tongue
as a page marker

163
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:44,049
in the Bible he was holding.

164
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:46,218
This isn't that.

165
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:48,053
This is a medical student

166
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:50,656
or a trainee or someone trying
to make an extra buck

167
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:53,091
in a back-alley surgery,
and it went bad.

168
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,661
Actively bad.

169
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:02,600
You'll catch the Ripper
eventually.

170
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:04,735
Yeah, well,
I want to catch him now.

171
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:08,640
And when I do, you're not gonna
get a chance to shoot him,

172
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,708
'cause I'm gonna do that.

173
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:13,477
You can't just jack up the law
and get underneath it.

174
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:15,111
Can't I?

175
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:25,755
Tell me how you see the Ripper,
Will.

176
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:29,225
I see him

177
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:34,096
as one of those pitiful things

178
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:36,031
sometimes born

179
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:38,133
in hospitals.

180
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:41,370
They feed it, keep it warm,

181
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:45,640
but they don't put it
on the machines.

182
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,644
They let it die.

183
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,146
But he doesn't die.

184
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:55,750
He looks normal.

185
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:02,389
And nobody can tell what he is.

186
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:05,959
Good morning. Please come in.

187
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,974
Would you like to discuss
our chance encounter?

188
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,676
(Franklyn chuckles.)

189
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:26,045
It wasn't altogether
by chance.

190
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:29,515
I kind of... kinda thought
you'd be there...

191
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,184
which isn't why I was there.
I-I... I was there

192
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:34,219
because I like
that sort of thing.

193
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:37,656
Uh, it just occurred to me that...
that you might like it too.

194
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,424
In fact, I do.

195
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,059
I tried to get your attention.

196
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,395
I was aware of that.

197
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:45,230
I knew that you were aware,

198
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:48,600
even though you were
pretending that you weren't.

199
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:52,336
It would be unethical
to approach a patient

200
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:55,873
or acknowledge in any way our
relationship outside this room

201
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,310
until that patient gives
consent.

202
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:02,546
But I really don't know
who you are outside this room.

203
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:05,048
I'm your psychiatrist.

204
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,550
- I want you to be my friend.
- Of course you do.

205
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,753
I have intimate knowledge
of you.

206
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,822
And we like the same things. I think
that we would make good friends.

207
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,259
It makes me sad
that I have to pay to see you.

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,802
(Franklyn sighs.)

209
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,639
I am a source of stability

210
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:33,208
and clarity, Franklyn.
I'm not your friend.

211
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:36,545
I'm a great friend.

212
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:40,782
I was listening to, uh,
Michael Jackson last night,

213
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,985
and I burst into tears, and...

214
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:47,888
my eyes are burning right now
just talking about it.

215
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:53,627
You know what I think is
the saddest thing

216
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:59,633
about him dying is that I will
never get to meet him,

217
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:02,536
and I feel like
if I was his friend

218
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:05,505
that I... I would have
been able to...

219
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:08,375
help save him from himself.

220
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,946
In this Michael Jackson fantasy,
how is your friendship returned?

221
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,651
I just get to touch greatness.

222
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,257
Hello. Come on in.

223
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:34,966
This always goes better if I'm
perfectly honest with you.

224
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,869
What would be the point
otherwise?

225
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:41,138
Well, one of us has
to be honest.

226
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,006
I'm honest.

227
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:45,509
Not perfectly.

228
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,778
As honest as anyone.

229
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:50,514
Not really.

230
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:54,150
I have conversations
with a version of you

231
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:59,622
and hope that the actual you
gets what he needs.

232
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,824
A version of me?

233
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:04,527
Naturally,

234
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:07,764
I respect
its meticulous construction,

235
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:09,832
but you are wearing

236
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,802
a very well-tailored
"person suit".

237
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,004
Do you refer to me
as "person suit"

238
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:18,239
with your psychiatrist friends?

239
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:22,711
I don't discuss patients
with my psychiatrist friends,

240
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:27,181
especially since I only have
one patient who chose to ignore

241
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:29,450
my retirement.

242
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:32,686
A patient who wears
a person suit.

243
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:37,326
Maybe it's less of a person
suit and more of a human veil.

244
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,495
That must be lonely.

245
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:44,197
I have friends.

246
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:46,165
And the opportunities
for friends.

247
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,401
You and I are friendly.

248
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:54,774
You are my patient
and my colleague, not my friend.

249
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,510
At the end of your hour,

250
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,447
I will pour you
a glass of wine.

251
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,213
Nevertheless,

252
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,117
you will be drinking it
on the other side of the veil.

253
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,587
Why do you bother?

254
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,557
I see enough of you
to see the truth of you.

255
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,893
And I like you.

256
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:17,028
Red or white?

257
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,867
I think something pink,
don't you?

258
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,239
Good evening, Will.

259
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,842
Please come in.

260
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,713
Oh, you've been drinking.

261
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:40,116
I had a glass of wine
with my last appointment, yes.

262
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:41,618
Drinking with a patient.

263
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:45,388
Ah, she was drinking
with a patient.

264
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:48,625
I have an unconventional
psychiatrist.

265
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:51,193
Well, we have that in common.

266
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,330
Am I your psychiatrist,

267
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:58,066
or are we simply having
conversations?

268
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:03,005
"Yes" I think is the answer
to that.

269
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:05,507
Then having a glass of wine
before seeing a patient,

270
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:08,442
I assure you,
is very conventional.

271
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:11,379
Especially
for evening appointments.

272
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:15,182
Huh. How long have you been
seeing a psychiatrist?

273
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,252
Since I chose
to be a psychiatrist.

274
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:26,527
Thank you.

275
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,337
I read the Freddy Lounds article.
Chesapeake Ripper has struck again.

276
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,271
No, no, no.
No, it's not the same guy.

277
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,708
Maybe it's never been
the same guy.

278
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:46,145
Oh, what, now he has a friend?
(Will chuckles.)

279
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:48,313
Any variations in the murders

280
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:51,551
that might suggest there could be more
than one Ripper? Some variations.

281
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,558
The victims were
all brutalized.

282
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,161
What was the brutalization
hiding?

283
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:04,930
The careful

284
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,066
surgical removal

285
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,734
and preservation of vital
organs.

286
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:14,705
Valuable organs.

287
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,444
Organ harvesters?

288
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,346
Jack's looking for a serial
killer he can't seem to catch.

289
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:25,249
It's a brilliant diversion.

290
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,850
That's an interesting theory.

291
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:33,422
I will keep it in mind
if another body drops.

292
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,024
Please do.

293
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:38,694
(Doctor): Any other
infections?

294
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,063
(Hannibal): You seem convinced
I'm diseased.

295
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:44,200
I was asking a broader question.
A disease is an infection.

296
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,435
An infection isn't
always a disease.

297
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:48,670
- That is true.
- You should just tell me now,

298
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,672
because I'm going to find out,
and it will affect

299
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,209
your insurance if you lie.

300
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:57,212
May I ask
for your business card, please,

301
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,880
for my records?

302
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:03,485
(Baritone singing in Italian)

303
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:38,416
(Frustrated shout): Agh!

304
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:00,937
Do you need a hand?

305
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:03,940
I think I must have hit
a rock or something.

306
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:06,043
It gouged my gas tank.

307
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,213
Have we met before?

308
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:24,606
<i>Found him in a school bus, sitting
across the asile from himself.</i>

309
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,512
Not only did the Ripper take
his kidney...

310
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:32,783
but he also took his heart,
which, if you'll recall, is what

311
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,119
he tried to do in the hotel but was interrupted
before he could paint his picture.

312
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,960
The Ripper wasn't painting a picture
in the hotel. Someone else was.

313
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:46,796
You still think that he was ripping
out a heart to save a life?

314
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:50,500
- Yes, I do.
- The Ripper painted this picture, for sure.

315
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,268
In big, broad strokes.

316
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,844
Could both victims' organs have
been harvested for transplant?

317
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:06,347
Subtle variation on waking up in
a tub of ice missing a kidney?

318
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:09,384
I love a good urban legend.
You could put the organs

319
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:12,320
on a ventilator long enough
to coordinate the donation.

320
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:15,123
At the hotel,
the victim's abdominal aorta

321
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,658
and inferior vena cava...
that's like the kidney's

322
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,727
in-and-out for blood...
were entirely removed.

323
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:23,464
They're like USB cables. You keep
them intact for an easy reconnect.

324
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,399
Were Mr. Caldwell's heart
and kidney disconnected

325
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,635
for easy reconnect?
Yeah.

326
00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:31,439
Um, other Ripper victims...
Organs and USB cables missing?

327
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:32,939
It's inconclusive

328
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:35,508
due to the degree
of mutilation, but yes,

329
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:39,045
that is how the Ripper rips. Two
different killers, same agenda?

330
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:41,581
Is the organ harvester
disguising his work

331
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:45,752
<i>as the crimes of a serial killer,
or is the serial killer disguising</i>

332
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,687
<i>his crimes as the work</i>
<i>of an organ harvester?</i>

333
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:51,423
The Chesapeake Ripper wants
to perform.

334
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:54,125
Every brutal choice has...

335
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:56,495
elegance,

336
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:58,096
grace.

337
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:03,802
His mutilations hide
the true nature of his crimes.

338
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,938
<i>(Concerto for Two Violins,</i>
<i>"Largo", by J.S. Bach)</i>

339
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,641
I've been unspeakably rude.

340
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:12,142
I Haven't offered you a drink.

341
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,846
I appreciate beer
more than wine.

342
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,949
It's not what you appreciate;
It's that you appreciate.

343
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:19,517
A compromise?

344
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,519
Beer brewed in a wine barrel.
Two years.

345
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,421
I bottled it myself.
(Pop!)

346
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:39,668
A cabernet sauvignon

wine barrel.
I love your pallet.

348
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:45,308
I love your beer.

349
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:48,311
I taste oak.

350
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,313
What else do I taste in there?

351
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:52,681
I will only answer that
yes or no.

352
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,750
Are you serving this
at your dinner party?

353
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:58,153
No. This is your reserve.

354
00:24:58,221 --> 00:24:59,988
My own private reserve?

355
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:01,656
Why, thank you.

356
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:04,092
I'm curious about something.

357
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:09,030
Are you purposefully avoiding
the subject of Will Graham?

358
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,732
Absolutely.

359
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,834
Not on my account, I hope.

360
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:16,537
I'm happy
to get your perspective.

361
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:19,340
No, it's on Jack Crawford's
account.

362
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:21,542
I don't want any information
about Will

363
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,710
that I shouldn't have
as his friend.

364
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:26,879
Did Jack ask you
to profile the Ripper?

365
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:30,350
Not since I consulted
on the case with Miriam

366
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:32,585
before she disappeared.

367
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:34,887
- Crawford's trainee.
- Yeah.

368
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:37,290
Very sad.

369
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:41,861
You had me examining
PhD candidates that week.

370
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,831
And I'm grateful you were examining
PhD students and not the Ripper.

371
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:50,870
You realize those candidates
thought we were having an affair.

372
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:53,172
Why didn't we?

373
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:56,642
You were already
having an affair.

374
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,777
Will does that too,
you know.

375
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:01,412
What?
Have affairs?

376
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,683
Flirtatiously change the subject.
You have that pathology in common.

377
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,685
Or we just have you in common.

378
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:10,421
I recall even before I met Will,
you never spoke about him.

379
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:12,591
Probably because
I just want everybody

380
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,959
to leave him alone.

381
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:19,362
It's not even about Will.

382
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,599
Jack's obsessed with

383
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,434
the Chesapeake Ripper and he's
grooming Will to catch him.

384
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:29,039
And I sincerely hope he does.

385

They're all missing
different organs.

388
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:35,105
Before, we were looking at waiting
lists for a heart or a kidney.

389
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,073
Now we're looking at hearts,

390

<i>kidneys, livers, stomachs,</i>

391
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:42,513
<i>pancreases, lungs.</i>

392
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,147
This guy,
he's missing a spleen.

393
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:46,682
A spleen!

394
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,586
Who the hell gets
a spleen transplant?

395
00:28:50,654 --> 00:28:53,055
Intestines were the only organ
missing from this body?

396
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:55,124
Yes, right, so we're either
looking for someone

397
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,495
with short bowels or...
Ripper's making sausage.

<i>(Piano Sonata No.11,</i>
<i>"Alla Turca", by Mozart)</i>

399
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:08,469
He's selling
these organs to someone.

400
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,705
We don't even know
if he's transplanting them

401
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:14,709
within the US. He could be exporting
them to China. The Chinese have a cultural

402
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:16,744
taboo that restricts voluntary
donation. You gotta die

403
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,913
with all your parts
or you dishonor mommy and daddy.

404
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,649
I mean, you could still kill a guy
for parts. That doesn't break that taboo.

405
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,450
I was agreeing with you.

406
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:26,921
- Well, I was.
- Your tone was a little...

407

(Jack): Ok, ok.
(They clear their throats.)

408
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:31,525
How many killers?

409
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:33,360
Two.

410
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:35,328
You confident one of them is
the Chesapeake Ripper?

411
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:37,764
At least one of them, yep.

412
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:45,205
Good morning.

Please come in.

414
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:55,881
I discovered
that we are cheese folk.

415
00:29:57,884 --> 00:30:01,454
I saw you shopping for cheese.
I didn't say hello,

416
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:04,190
because you were
so uncomfortable the last time

417
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:05,890
that I did.

418
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,892
This city is very small.

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,361
Yes. José's.

420
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,065
José's has the best selection
of artisanal cheeses

421
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,234
in Baltimore, city or county.

423
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:20,271
Cheese is my passion.

424

You ever heard of Tyromancy?

Divination by cheese.

426
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,978
It was my gateway to cheeses.

427
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:32,483
It was like a magic 8 ball
that you can eat.

428
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,918
Tobias, he, um...

429
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,312
He doesn't eat dairy.

430
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:45,628
Do you desire Tobias sexually?

431
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:47,396
No.

432
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:50,866
God, no. Uh... no.

433
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:54,269
Not to be defensive.
I just, um...

434
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:56,605
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I was in a "fraternity".

435
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:58,740
I-I-I tried things, you know?

436
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,442
Uh, um...

437
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,677
It's just not my brand.

438
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:05,614
You care deeply about Tobias

439
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,449
despite differences.

440
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:10,884
He's your best friend,
but you're not his.

441
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,987
Well, it's sad when you say it
like that.

442
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:19,193
You often worry
about being alone?

443
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:22,329
I worry about hurting.

444
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:26,799
Being alone comes with a...

445
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,768
A dull ache.

446
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:30,770
Doesn't it?

447
00:31:30,837 --> 00:31:33,105
It can.

00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:32,840
has its appeal
in many cultures.

480
00:34:32,907 --> 00:34:34,842
These aren't
the Ripper's enemies,

481
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,211
these are pests
he's swatted.

482
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:41,349
Their reward
for their cruelty.

483
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,851
Oh, he doesn't have a problem
with cruelty.

484
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,854
Their reward is
for undignified behavior.

485
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,823
These dissections are
to disgrace them.

486
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,960
It's... it's
a public shaming.

487
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,697
Takes their organs away

488
00:34:57,765 --> 00:35:00,599
because, in his mind,
they don't deserve them.

489
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,104
In some way.

490
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,843
What's this?

491
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:13,845
It's Jack Crawford's trainee.

492
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:15,846
She's not like
the other victims.

493
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:19,184
The Ripper had no reason
to humiliate Miriam Lass.

494
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:22,453
Seems to me
he was humiliating someone.

495
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,822
Yeah, he was humiliating Jack.

496
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,758
Did it work?

497
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,062
I'd say it worked really well.

498
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:40,196
I've been looking for
the kill truck... a van or SUV...

499
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:44,033
But it was a whole lot easier
than that.

500
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,970
- What am I looking at here?
- One of the hotel security cameras.

501
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:49,673
- Kill truck?
- It's a private ambulance.

502
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:52,259
The city works with dozens
of private ambulance companies.

503
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:53,326
Including this one.

504
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:56,974
But not as a first responder. A first
responder driving away from the emergency?

505
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:01,250
Have a seat.

506
00:36:03,186 --> 00:36:06,155
Ambulance would be
a smart place to perform

507
00:36:06,222 --> 00:36:08,023
surgery.
If the cops show up,

508
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:10,759
blend in and drive away.

509
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:17,565
Where's Will Graham?

510
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,567
Will. There you are.

511
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:23,037
And Dr. Lecter.
What a surprise. We have a lead.

512
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:25,906
Would you care to, uh, help us
catch the Ripper?

513
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:28,809
How could I refuse?

514
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:32,646
That ambulance isn't in rotation. It
hasn't even been out of the shed.

515
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:34,682
Surveillance footage says
it has been.

516
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:37,584
Well, nobody's signed her out. My road
sheet's got her down for repairs.

517
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,586
And who signed her in
for repairs?

518
00:36:39,654 --> 00:36:41,587
Devon Silvestri. He's one
of our part-time drivers.

519
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:44,657
- Does he want to be a doctor?
- He's taking the MCATs.

520
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:47,293
What?

521
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:48,928
It was there this morning.

522
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:50,797
It was there this morning.

523
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:53,633
Well. Is Mr. Silvestri working

524
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,735
- today?
- He's not on the schedule.

525
00:36:55,803 --> 00:36:58,203
Is there GPS on that ambulance?

526
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,105
- Mm-hmm.
- Encrypted messaging, or remote tracking?

527
00:37:01,173 --> 00:37:03,709
We can't afford that kind of
hardware. We use consumer grade.

528
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:06,745
- Digital trunk system.
- Yeah.

529
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:10,682
Jack. If the ambulance radio is on,
I can use a DF sweep to find it.

530
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,084
Good.

531
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:16,220
This is very educational.

532
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:20,123
(Classical choral music)

533
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,921
- Show me your hands.
- I can't.

534
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:55,391
Show me your hands.

535
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:59,328
He'll die.

536
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:01,264
Dr. Lecter!

537
00:38:08,237 --> 00:38:10,671
I need you to assess
the situation here, doctor.

538
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:19,313
He was removing his kidney.

539
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,248
Poorly.

540
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:24,084
- I can stop the bleeding.
- Do it.

541
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:39,365
- Have you got it?
- I've got it.

542
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:41,935
Mr. Silvestri, put your hands
behind your head

543
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:46,172
and exit the vehicle slowly.
Do it.

544
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:52,210
On the ground. On your knees.

545
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,281

547
00:39:44,194 --> 00:39:47,429
I have a butcher who carries
sow's blood.

548
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,499
Centrifugate...

549
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,634
Separate the matter

550
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:54,036
Creates a transparent liquid.

551
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:02,143
Serve with tomatoes
in suspension

552
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:04,412
and everybody will
love the sweet taste.

553
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,180
Are you sure you can't stay?

554
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:08,650
Uh, I don't think
I would be good company.

555
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:10,518
I disagree.

556
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,722
But before you go,

557
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:17,257
what became
of Mr. Sylvestri's donor?

558
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,192
You saved his life.

559
00:40:21,763 --> 00:40:24,899
Been a long time since I used a
scalpel on anything but a pencil.

560
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:27,800
Why'd you stop being a surgeon?

561
00:40:27,868 --> 00:40:30,870
I killed someone...
or, more accurately,

562
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:33,239
I couldn't save someone.
But it felt like killing them.

563
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,108
You were an emergency room surgeon.
It has to happen from time to time.

564
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:38,978
It happened one time too many.

565
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:42,281
I transferred my passion for
anatomy into the culinary arts.

566
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:45,350
I fix minds instead of bodies,

567
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:47,719
and no one's died as a result
of my therapy.

568
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,721
(Will chuckles.)

569
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,957
I have to go.

570
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:55,427
I have a date
with the Chesapeake Ripper.

571
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,796
Or is that rippers?

572
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:00,874
Devon Silvestri was harvesting organs,
but not with the Ripper.

573
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:02,199
There's no connection
between them.

574
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:04,301
Jack must be devastated.

575
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,301
Will: <i>I imagine he is.</i>

576
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,426
Enjoy the wine.

577
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:13,994
Thank you.

578
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,331

nothing here...
