1
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,800
Uh, yeah...

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,712
can I get the mixed
vegetables and white rice?

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,716
Okay, mixed vegetables,
white rice.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,978
Damn, Du'.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,679
You actin' like this
some fancy-ass spot.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,277
It ain't nothing
but a Chink joint.

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,310
I'm-a order.

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,653
Then do it.
I said I got it.

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,826
Look at this nigger
flashin' his shit

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,660
Iike some big-time
gangster.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,290
Yeah, Na'
a righteous hustler.

12
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,028
Man, I'm just treating
y'all, that's all.

13
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,161
You know I like to keep it
real with the little people.

14
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,329
Man, fuck you, man.

15
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,004
- I was talking about you.
- I was talking about you.

16
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,272
May I help you?

17
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,507
Can I order the yakame
with turkey grease?

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,312
Yakame, noodles--

19
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,842
- This nigger ordered turkey grease.
- What's wrong, yo?

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,548
I mean, my mom,
she get it all the time.

21
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,022
Yo, you is really one of
them at-risk children,

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,027
- you know that, Dukie?
- Yo, man, leave him alone, son.

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,119
Yeah, I got it.
How much?

24
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,220
- $4.00.
- Why is it so funny?

25
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,423
They just
goofin' on you.

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,692
What's wrong with
me ordering yakame?

27
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,063
Nothing wrong with
you ordering yakame.

28
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,965
It's just the turkey grease
that makes the drunks,

29
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,300
you know, throw up all that
liquor they was drinking,

30
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,635
go back to swilling
that shit.

31
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:17,965
Man, this shit is good.

32
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,103
Why don't you
buy your own food?

33
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,134
This is all you getting.

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,943
Don't ask for
no more of that.

35
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,471
That shit
tastes good as hell.

36
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,781
Yo, y'all heard about
what happened to Little Kevin?

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,809
What?

38
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,321
He be dead.

39
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,380
- He up in them vacants.
- Why?

40
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,415
Fucked up somewhere,
I suppose.

41
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,560
Uh-oh.

42
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,497
What the fuck you little
hoppers doing on my avenue?

43
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,965
- Eating.
- Shit you are.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,264
You're probably setting up
to snatch a purse.

45
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,531
Get the fuck back
on the reservation

46
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,539
where your
black asses belong.

47
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,972
How you feeling,
little man?

48
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,465
Need a hand with that food?

49
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,570
I said get.

50
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,446
Yo, y'all hear that shit?
"My avenue."

51
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,458
It's just as much
ours as it is his.

52
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,618
Walker be evil, yo.

53
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,126
He be thieving and
smackin' folk down.

54
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,287
Yo, we should
get him back

55
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,354
on the payback tip
for all the dirt he do.

56
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,627
You want to throw
down with police?

57
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,963
I don't mean
go at him direct,

58
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,628
but, you know, hurt him.

59
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,638
Like, slash his tires
or some shit.

60
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,971
We could stick
condoms on his car.

61
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,306
That'd send a message.

62
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,834
Yeah, but what kind?

63
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,676
We should slap bumper stickers
on his windshield.

64
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,944
I mean, they
is hard to get off.

65
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,450
Hold on,
wait wait wait.

66
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,419
Do Officer Walker
go to that club on Stockton,

67
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,921
the one where
the Western police party?

68
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,822
I seen his car there.

69
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,520
I got this one.

70
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,463
And as much as I empathize,

71
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,590
I can only tell you
that there is a process

72
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,793
for complaints
like this one.

73
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,132
Don't sell us on process,
Mr. Mayor.

74
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,967
We've had years of this kind
of treatment from city police.

75
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,098
You need to understand

76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,767
we view this as an affront
to the cloth.

77
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,368
We've asked for
a civilian review board

78
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,676
for decades now.
Absent that, how can we trust

79
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,978
any investigation
of any complaint?

80
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,986
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but last I checked,

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,681
the department had
a black commissioner

82
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,655
and a black
l.I.D. director.

83
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,521
The problem is systemic.

84
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,991
And as to
Commissioner Burrell--

85
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,827
we understand that
his authority is now limited.

86
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,957
Mr. Mayor, when it comes
to matters like this one,

87
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,264
do you expect us to have
faith in Deputy Rawls?

88
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,668
I expect you'll
be good enough

89
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,103
not to prejudge
the department's response

90
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,039
before the investigation
even begins,

91
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,564
as I won't prejudge it.

92
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,442
I can only tell you that l
take this incident very seriously,

93
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,470
and that I will pursue
all of the facts.

94
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,846
Well, Mr. Mayor,

95
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,353
you said you would
have an open door,

96
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,254
and so far I credit you
for keeping that promise.

97
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,781
And my door will always
be open to you.

98
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,157
Thank you.

99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,897
If they couldn't get civilian review
out of a Royce administration,

100
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,631
how can they think
they're gonna get it from me?

101
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,968
They're just
testing you here,

102
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,167
trying to see how vulnerable
you feel on the racial stuff.

103
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,800
On Burrell, too,
for what it's worth.

104
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,811
Well, civilian review
is a nonstarter.

105
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,312
You go now there now,

106
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,282
you'll be bending over
for four years for the ministers.

107
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,305
So what?
I throw them a bone

108
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,784
and fire some idiot cop?

109
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,343
By pressing that,
the average beat cop's

110
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,820
gonna hate my guts,
and I ain't gonna change

111
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,823
anything around without
rank-and-file support.

112
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,347
You don't fire him,
you're going to piss off

113
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,383
most of the black
political infrastructure.

114
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:05,193
Mm, yummy.
My first bowl of shit.

115
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,933
Circle that
right there.

116
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,942
And you press
that right there.

117
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,283
It's work time.

118
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,285
You guys got work to do?
You write down that data?

119
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,946
- Yeah.
- All right.

120
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,586
Charlene, what don't
you understand?

121
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,286
None of it.

122
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,795
Okay, let's see if we can find a way
you can get it, okay?

123
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,989
What's the diameter?

124
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,588
- Huh?
- It's seven.

125
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,827
Good. Okay,
what's half of that?

126
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,802
You can't take half of it.

127
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,133
Okay, let's say
you have $10

128
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,695
and you gave
half of it to Jasmine.

129
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,798
Why I do that?

130
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,810
Well, just pretend, okay?

131
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,368
You give her half,
how much does she have?

132
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,313
- Duh, $5.
- Good.

133
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,316
Now let's say this
time you have $7

134
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,818
and you give her half,
how much does she have?

135
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,410
$3.50.

136
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,254
Good, so...

137
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,954
Yo, Mr. Prez,
check this out.

138
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,261
Oh!

139
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,938
Why we no pick him up at his casa,
follow him from there?

140
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,906
Why, so we can
lose him here again?

141
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,501
Papa, nothin' say he got to come back
through this way, you know?

142
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,602
What if he take
another road...?

143
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,976
All right.

144
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,106
We pick him up
from his casa tomorrow.

145
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,449
Poutin'.
Don't pout.

146
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,079
Omar, I'm tired
of this, bro.

147
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,650
Lo siento, baby.
Lo siento.

148
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,294
Hey, now...

149
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,665
there she blow.

150
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,646
All right, then.

151
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,344
So we agree staring down

152
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,376
a stick-up boy on a corner
takes courage,

153
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,321
and we agree it takes
courage to go overnight

154
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,221
to Cheltenham or Hickey.

155
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,555
This is a good list,

156
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,288
but are there any
examples we can make

157
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,923
outside of being
on a corner?

158
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,796
I need a volunteer.

159
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,094
Not me.

160
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,796
What about you, Albert?

161
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,202
No.

162
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,900
You volunteer
and you don't know what for,

163
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,430
you ain't got brains.

164
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,601
All right, then,

165
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,770
I need a volunteer
to stand on this box

166
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,645
blindfolded, fall off,
and let us catch him

167
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,943
before he hits the ground.

168
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,608
Albert?

169
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,120
That's fucking stupid.

170
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,452
What about you, Namond?

171
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,458
Wait wait wait,
let me get this right.

172
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,289
So you want me to stand up
on that box,

173
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,625
put a blindfold on, fall,

174
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,121
and expect these
weak-ass clowns to catch me?

175
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,827
Hell, no.

176
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,898
Hey, yo, y'all drop me,

177
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,238
and we gonna have
more than words.

178
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,741
A'ight.

179
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,612
All right, everybody
gather around.

180
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,778
Oh, shit.

181
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,552
You ready? On three.

182
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,754
One, two, three.

183
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,955
Let him drop.

184
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,932
Whoa! Shit!
Oh, that shit was right.

185
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,434
All right,
who wants to go next?

186
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,594
Albert?

187
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,763
I ain't doing no
stupid shit like that!

188
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,273
Fuck you, and fuck all
y'all bitches.

189
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,944
We don't like
your ass anyway.

190
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,415
Settle down,
settle down.

191
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,211
Yo, today's specials
are those little Hershey bars,

192
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,951
three for a dime.

193
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,686
And I got all your
other favorites, too.

194
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,853
Yo, Deante,
I got your licorice--

195
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,362
red and black both.

196
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,296
Snitchin' Randy.

197
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,310
Well, I'll be blessed, yo.
Lookit.

198
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,047
This is good?
We put him here?

199
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,647
That tall man with Prop Joe?

200
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,680
Yo, for real,
on this caper

201
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,659
the more we learn,
the less we know.

202
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,662
- We can go?
- No, we stay.

203
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,993
Papa, I need to go.

204
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,999
I say we stay, Renaldo.
What's wrong, yo?

205
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,159
No no, I mean "go."

206
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,564
We been in the car
too many hours.

207
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,832
Whether you squat in an alley

208
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,840
or sittin' on
a porcelain throne,

209
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,310
don't really change
the moment, now do it?

210
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,540
Rough day?

211
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,578
Doesn't help to hold it in.

212
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,849
What the fuck you know?

213
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,052
If you tell me,
maybe we can help.

214
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,128
Ain't nothing.

215
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,565
Look, come on, Albert, you been
doing real good in this class.

216
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,660
Real good till today.

217
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,168
Just give it a try.

218
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:28,112
I went home yesterday.
My mom's on the couch.

219
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,247
She dead.

220
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,383
Me-maw said best l
come to school, but...

221
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,162
Oh.

222
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,860
Yeah, you wanted
to be with your mom.

223
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,928
Of course you did.

224
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,507
Some of you know me
from narcotics work,

225
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,806
some from earlier if you
worked the Western district,

226
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,436
and some of you I'm meeting
for the first time.

227
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,879
But the only point l'd
really like to make here today

228
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,883
is that this is
a transitional time

229
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,442
for this department
and for the city as a whole.

230
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,818
We have a new mayor
and a new state's attorney,

231
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,517
and they both feel like
they have a mandate for change.

232
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,228
The point is that given
the mayor's position on crime

233
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,891
and given the outcome of the election,
we can expect certain enhancements.

234
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,457
Oh, really?

235
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,493
Certain improvements may be
forthcoming in the near future.

236
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,164
So we're looking
for feedback here,

237
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,230
some input
as to what we need

238
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,969
more of or less of
to better work murders.

239
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,705
- Better witness protection.
- More proactive investigation.

240
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,838
Pay raise.

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,973
Yeah!

242
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,609
Better lab work. More techs
on duty. More overtime.

243
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,551
More Scotch!

244
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,817
More time for case prep.
Seriously.

245
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,949
More women.
Loose women.

246
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,982
Pay hike, double-digits.

247
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,517
Mo' better,
mo' better, mo' better.

248
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,860
That's what we want.

249
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,660
Sounds like a new day,
don't it?

250
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,034
Department's finally gonna
get what it needs.

251
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,834
State's attorney's
office, too.

252
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,171
A new day.

253
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,869
They make a nice
couple, anyway.

254
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,378
Looking forward to working
with you, Colonel.

255
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,612
That's signed by
a now-inaugurated mayor

256
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,211
ordering his police commanders
to avoid mass arrests.

257
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,482
Community-based policing

258
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,888
and high-end enforcements
are to be emphasized.

259
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,221
I take it Burrell
got a copy.

260
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,284
In person.

261
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,817
I don't see it.

262
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,853
Why not just fire
the fucking asshole?

263
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,331
The mayor is weighing
his options.

264
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,492
What the fuck
does that mean?

265
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,092
To fire Burrell,
we're going to need more

266
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,763
political capital
than we have right now.

267
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,104
Speaking of which,
it brings us to another

268
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,631
Iittle piece of business.

269
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,702
- The thing with the minister.
- It's a delicate situation.

270
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,805
The ministers are pressing
for a civilian review,

271
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,839
which I know the rank and file
don't want to hear,

272
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,545
but it speaks directly to
the situation with Burrell.

273
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,146
If we expend capital
defending this incident--

274
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,487
I get it.
You want the cop fired.

275
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,219
No, we're not saying
that at all.

276
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,624
The mayor doesn't
want to interfere with

277
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,324
the everyday workings
of the department.

278
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,491
But it's a balancing act.

279
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,502
Our response has to be
smart and evenhanded,

280
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,333
in a racial sense, especially.

281
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,168
If I'm hearing you,
it's about perception.

282
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,107
Exactly.

283
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,939
I.I.D. has
a black commander,

284
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,945
but he's beholden to Burrell.

285
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,971
He'll stir shit
with this if he can.

286
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,047
The sergeant in question
is assigned to C.I.D.

287
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,884
His new commander
is Daniels.

288
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,949
He's smart, he's black,
and politically neutral.

289
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,986
- That work for you?
- Works for us.

290
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,168
Who that?
I said, who's that?

291
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,481
You home or you
just visiting?

292
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,977
Home if I can.

293
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,857
All right. Get by the fire
if you want.

294
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,589
I got a couple of dogs left.
You hungry?

295
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,264
Shit weren't working
out with Jo-Jo and them.

296
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,776
Said I owed him some cheddar
on some shit some other boy did.

297
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,334
I don't want to make
no noise on that, though.

298
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,573
They pressin' you.

299
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,745
You know...

300
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,447
get with me, and we pay
'em right back, okay?

301
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,614
No, all that shit
you been sayin' to me

302
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,782
goin' through my head.

303
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,290
Forget about that.
Forget about all that.

304
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,792
If I wouldn't have
pushed you off,

305
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,259
you would have never
been up on that corner.

306
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,286
But everything I do
I be fucking up.

307
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,457
Whole time it feel like it
wasn't me on that corner.

308
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,660
I just wanted to get away.

309
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,302
Well, you're here now,
ain't you? Right?

310
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,299
This is you, right here,
right now, okay?

311
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,314
You're burning a hole
in that shirt, man.

312
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,474
Fuck-- you fucked me
all up when

313
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,881
I saw you walking through
the door, Sherrod.

314
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,908
Oh, shit.

315
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,147
What you think, huh?

316
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,485
You know, I get
half price for this.

317
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,820
All right,
take your hat off, man.

318
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:02,020
Don't burn them
pimp steaks, huh?

319
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,631
Took long enough.

320
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,407
Yo, Dukie,
you sure about this?

321
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,506
I mean,
I'm with y'all.

322
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,073
Y'all my boys like that.

323
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,608
Y'all there for me,
I'm there for y'all.

324
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,622
I'm really starting to think
this is some fucked-up shit.

325
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,284
I mean, Officer Walker's
a shady motherfucker,

326
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,954
but he's police.

327
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,964
We do it Michael's way,
we send a message.

328
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,559
You ain't got to do
what I got to do.

329
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,660
We drew straws, Na'.

330
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,024
Let's go.

331
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,100
This is everything?

332
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,265
Sergeant Hauk's statement,
the ministers',

333
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,604
statements of the other
officers-- it's all there.

334
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,269
No independent witnesses, huh?

335
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,436
It's a lot of smoke,

336
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,945
but I'm not feeling much
in the way of fire.

337
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,777
It was a strong case
for discourtesy.

338
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,943
True, but no indication of
racial or religious overtones.

339
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,284
And the brutality
allegation is a stretch.

340
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,619
I've gone over G.O.C.-7.

341
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,955
I'm up to speed
with the matrix,

342
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,120
but since the buck stops
with me on this one,

343
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,130
walk me through my options.

344
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:49,464
Minor offenses, you can
issue a summary judgment--

345
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,264
a period of extra
duty without pay,

346
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,294
guidance and counseling,
the like.

347
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,397
Or if Sergeant Hauk
fights your decision

348
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,238
or if there's a more
substantive charge,

349
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,005
it goes downstairs
to a trial board.

350
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,035
And possible termination?

351
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,249
Let me ask you--

352
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,414
if the minister's connected,

353
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,924
and if all eyes
are on this one,

354
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,926
what does command
want to see happen?

355
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,518
What does City Hall
want to see happen?

356
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,588
City Hall just wants
someone to do the right thing,

357
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,098
whatever that is.

358
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,157
You're sitting here, Deputy,

359
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,260
telling me to just
do the right thing?

360
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,136
Doesn't happen often,
I know.

361
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,798
Hey! What are you doing?
Come here!

362
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,404
You motherfucker,
I'll get your little ass!

363
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,397
Hey hey hey!

364
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,568
Come on,
show me hands, bitch.

365
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,078
Back the fuck up,
little hopper, I'm police.

366
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,170
Yeah, I know,
you the police who like

367
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,340
to fuck with a nigger.
Turn around.

368
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,077
Hey hey, yo!

369
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,746
You ain't gonna
hear the next one.

370
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,584
Get on your knees,
cross them legs,

371
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,523
knit them hands, come on.

372
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,756
Ooh, hold on.

373
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,765
Yo, what the
fuck you doing?

374
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,096
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

375
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,763
Hey, give up that ring, man.

376
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,635
Come on.

377
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,635
Yeah.

378
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,577
Aah!

379
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,620
Ha ha ha!
Payback.

380
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,554
That's right.
Run, motherfuckers!

381
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,821
Shit!

382
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,632
I'm telling you,
right there,

383
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,302
this horse is a winner.
Look at it, okay?

384
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,810
How you doing?

385
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,243
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

386
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,541
Mr. Mayor.

387
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,482
On my way downtown today
I saw an abandoned car.

388
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,643
Tow it right away.

389
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,984
Where is-- Mr. Mayor,
the location?

390
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,148
Oh, fucking Christ.
Call Transpo!

391
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,555
Get the fucking
trucks moving!

392
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:33,987
Uh-- Mr. Mayor.

393
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,226
I got a constituent call.

394
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,701
She said the playground
near her house was a hazard.

395
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,670
- Rusted metal.
- We'll get right on it.

396
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,263
The location?

397
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,933
Sir, I need a location.

398
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,466
Mr. Mayor, I understand your concern,
but you've got to understand,

399
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,012
we have more
than 9,100 hydrants.

400
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,379
And one of them's leaking.

401
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,848
Sensitivity counseling,

402
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,946
two week's extra duty,
no punishment past that.

403
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,185
They sliced it
into the rough.

404
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,285
Does Daniels know the bind
this puts his boy Carcetti in?

405
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:07,765
Well, Wilson briefed Rawls,
Rawls briefed Daniels.

406
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,029
It's Carcetti
doing Pontius Pilate,

407
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,400
putting it on Daniels,
who was a safe choice

408
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,302
as far as
the rank and file goes.

409
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,806
But that won't be enough
for the ministers,

410
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,399
not by a long shot.

411
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,683
Am I the only one that knows
how to play this game?

412
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,184
Let's go,
get that hydrant sealed.

413
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,753
Three of them with shotguns

414
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,457
got me coming
outside the club.

415
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,930
I made 'em for bloods.

416
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,332
The paint's supposed to be some
kind of declaration of war.

417
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,234
Sounds like we get
to stomp some ass.

418
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,671
The Western District way.

419
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,240
Yellow paint
a declaration of war?

420
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,644
That's a new one.

421
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,753
So what I heard was
that these wild-ass boys--

422
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,020
I ain't saying no names--
but they past crazy.

423
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,321
They robbed him.

424
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,057
They threw paint on his ass--
yellow paint.

425
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,429
Shit, I ain't lying.

426
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,990
Well, I don't know
about that,

427
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,332
but you showed me something
getting on that box like that.

428
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,496
That wasn't nothing.

429
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,300
No, don't sell yourself short.

430
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,670
Ms. Duquette,
Mr. Parenti,

431
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,174
we all thought
it took courage,

432
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,006
especially considering
how y'all do each other.

433
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,511
You think?

434
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,274
Yeah.

435
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,545
No, look, you're showing
a lot of progress in class.

436
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,108
I mean, you know that,
don't you?

437
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,315
You know, you're doing
the work. You're not acting out.

438
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,822
It's getting
to the point where

439
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,621
You can go back to regular
class, no problem.

440
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,889
- Back to genpop?
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,520
You want me to go?

442
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,327
Well,
if you're ready.

443
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,192
I ain't going back there.

444
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,296
Why not?

445
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,706
Shit they teach
there be deadly.

446
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,269
But I know
you know that, Bunny.

447
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,803
All right, all right!
All right, all right!

448
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,748
We can squeeze a little
money from here and there

449
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,843
but nothing on the scale
for what you're asking.

450
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,478
Maybe free up
some operating money

451
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,989
by shifting some of these
PAYGO projects

452
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,388
into the capital program.

453
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,155
I can steal a little from
the budget stabilization fund,

454
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,630
but we still got to absorb
1 20 grant positions

455
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,598
in the police department,
mostly officers.

456
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,828
Christ, don't let
those go unfunded.

457
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,302
A lot of balls in the air, and I still
haven't seen the schools' budget.

458
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,100
What about
the revenue surplus?

459
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,970
As I said,
that's one-time money.

460
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:06,000
If I'm going to give
the police a 5% raise, that's forever.

461
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,443
If I'm going to ask the police
department to get up

462
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,468
on its hind legs and fight

463
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,502
I got to throw some money.

464
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,277
You're telling me how I can't
do it, not how I can.

465
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,783
There's the rainy day fund,

466
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,945
but you really shouldn't
draw that down.

467
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,853
The bond rating houses want
at least 5% of the budget in reserve.

468
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,153
Feels like a rainy day to me.

469
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,218
Cloudy like a motherfucker.

470
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,456
Yo, yo, wait up, yo.

471
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,039
- Fuck is up with y'all?
- Ain't you, Mike?

472
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,671
We wanna have a word
with your boy here.

473
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:45,080
- Ain't nothing stopping you. Talk.
- You know what we mean.

474
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,811
Yo, the little bitch
was talking to the police.

475
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,183
That's a lie.
I ain't been doin' no snitching.

476
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,312
The fuck you ain't.

477
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,187
He look like he about to pee
on hisself right now, man.

478
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,250
You ain't gonna stand by
no rat motherfucker, is you?

479
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,103
Naw, I ain't standing
with no rat.

480
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,973
These here be them
18-hour junks.

481
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,952
Go to bed, wake up,
still be hot.

482
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,980
Man, feel this one
from three hours ago.

483
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,457
See what I'm saying?
Two for one.

484
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,791
Each pack come with two pads.
Buy five, I give you six.

485
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,126
Gimmie six then.

486
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,461
Five.
Keep toasty.

487
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,296
Obliged, sir, obliged.

488
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,633
Take this side,
I'll take this side.

489
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,138
Bubbles Depot.

490
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,799
Bubbles Depot
got what you need.

491
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,708
Back on the scene.
Come see me.

492
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,304
Oh, looky,
looky-- hey, Sherrod!

493
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,804
Whoo-ooh. What up?

494
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,809
Car must've hit it
or some shit.

495
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,822
- How much you think?
- Aluminum?

496
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,984
Aluminum about
30-40� a pound.

497
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,859
We've got a Benjamin
here easy, baby.

498
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,929
Teamwork payin' off today,
ain't it, baby?

499
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,093
Yeah.

500
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,227
Go get the heavy side.
Let me try it.

501
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,941
Get out of the way!

502
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,637
That's enough!

503
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,771
Get out of here!

504
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,441
That's enough!
Break it up!

505
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,779
Hey, Randy, you bitch.

506
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,944
We ain't even done
with your snitchin' ass.

507
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,454
Come on, man.

508
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,616
Guess them books
are good for something.

509
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,121
Somebody call the nurse.

510
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,792
Yo, why they bank me?

511
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,802
- I ain't no snitch.
- Randy, Randy, it's okay.

512
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,505
Thanks a lot.

513
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,818
Health Department shut
Chicken George again?

514
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,342
No, I had to duck
in here for cover.

515
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,116
Your boys are
off the hook today.

516
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,765
Not a good day to be
cross-eyed in West Baltimore.

517
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,100
What, y'all behind on your
quotas or some shit?

518
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,107
What the fuck?

519
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,768
Seems one of my side
got jumped last night.

520
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,277
Yeah, Walker.
I heard about that shit.

521
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,404
Threw paint on him.

522
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,975
Walker's an asshole.

523
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,623
Hey, you play in dirt,
you get dirty.

524
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,786
7-Adam-14, do you copy?

525
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,590
Go ahead, KGA.

526
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,962
Report of a burglary
19 North Monroe.

527
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,830
Copy.

528
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,272
We should do this again.

529
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,967
Don't go making
any furtive moves.

530
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,134
No doubt.

531
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,337
Don't break a pencil point.

532
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,620
Mr. P, I swear I only told
the police what everybody knows.

533
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,154
Does that make me
a snitch, Michael?

534
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,822
Shouldn't oughta
told nobody nothing.

535
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,627
But that don't make you a snitch,
not if you ain't put nobody in.

536
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,759
Jesus. I should have
stopped this.

537
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,235
It ain't your fault, Mr. P.

538
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,999
All this come up because
of what Tiffany said

539
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,596
happened in the bathroom.

540
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,938
What did you tell them, Randy?
What do they know?

541
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,944
I just told them about Lex going up
to the playground behind Fulton,

542
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,775
and how everybody
said he got killed

543
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,179
and put in one of them
boarded-up houses.

544
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,614
That's all you told them?

545
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,142
I mean, they wanted me
to say that I was there, but...

546
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,289
I just told them
that Little Kevin told me.

547
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,154
- Little Kevin?
- He killed, too.

548
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:51,128
I mean, Marlo got him, too. That's
what everybody saying, anyway.

549
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,494
Marlo Stanfield?

550
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,100
I heard Kevin got
locked up just last week,

551
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,035
now he's supposed to be up
in a house somewhere.

552
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,867
They put him in
a vacant, too, huh?

553
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:07,274
Okay, Randy, for now
I want to say Michael's right.

554
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,371
If anyone tries
to talk to you again,

555
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,906
say nothing to anyone,
understand?

556
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,112
Will that make it better?

557
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,586
So in sum, gentlemen,
the gods have spoken.

558
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,594
No longer do we live
and die by stats.

559
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,188
From this day forward
we are about quality arrests--

560
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,290
felonies, serious misdemeanors,

561
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,268
the back-to-basics police work
of our sainted fathers.

562
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,894
Still, the truth is
it would be easier

563
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,667
to turn an oil tanker
around in a puddle.

564
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:39,006
Our people were
raised on stats.

565
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,035
If you can't bend patrol
to the mission, Eugene,

566
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,447
I'll damn sure find
someone who can.

567
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,314
Gentlemen.

568
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,978
Sir.

569
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,194
Along the line
of what you propose,

570
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,196
I'd like to reconstitute
the Major Crimes Unit,

571
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,857
bring it under the
umbrella of Homicide.

572
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,130
And let me guess, you'd like
to shake up the personnel.

573
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:08,128
Where appropriate.

574
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,004
Go for it, Colonel.

575
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,969
What?

576
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,983
Smart move,
accepting any ideas

577
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,976
whatsoever come from
the anointed fella.

578
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,114
Daniels.
The next commissioner.

579
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,090
Any cocksucker that
manages to go from

580
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:31,152
Iieutenant to full bird in
a little more than a year

581
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,824
is getting groomed.

582
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:38,131
Wait. You didn't for
a minute think that--

583
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,536
Jesus, Bill,
it's Baltimore.

584
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,031
You ain't one
of the natives, are ya?

585
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,854
You see where they went?

586
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,622
El gordo and tall man,
they go in a big room,

587
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,958
first floor.

588
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,123
Sign outside
say "New Day Coop."

589
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:11,295
Coop?
What's a coop?

590
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,736
"New Day Coop."
That's what it say.

591
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,740
Hey, yo, was there like a bar
between the two O's?

592
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,139
Si, exacto.

593
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,542
Yeah, that's co-op.

594
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,307
Prop Joe in a co-op?

595
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,474
Joe go in with
the man we robbed.

596
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,915
Remember, he fell
down on his knees,

597
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,282
wept like a little baby.

598
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,755
Yeah, Fat Face Ricky.
Anybody else?

599
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,748
Si, como eight or nine
others I never see before,

600
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,818
but all the same to me,
you know?

601
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,489
Narcotraficantes.

602
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,363
Prop Joe done
sat down to the table.

603
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,401
Oh, do tell.

604
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,031
The worm done
came full circle.

605
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,836
Marlo.

606
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,174
Que?

607
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,679
If that is what
I think it is,

608
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,681
our little clutch of
chickens might be putting

609
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,683
all their eggs
up in one basket.

610
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,617
Is good?

611
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,144
Muy bueno, baby.

612
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,390
I know one thing--
I wouldn't walk around

613
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,223
with it on my neck
for Walker to find.

614
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,785
He ain't gonna find it.

615
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,797
You crazy even
taking a chance.

616
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:14,957
If he catch you with it,

617
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,129
he gonna break more
than them fingers.

618
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,967
Man, what up with you?

619
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,803
It's like lately
you gone all...

620
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,638
Iike taking off
the mask, yo.

621
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,373
What up with that?
If Walker got a look--

622
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,711
He didn't.

623
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,340
Well, what about the thing
with you and Randy?

624
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,408
Everybody now is sayin'
you threw down with him.

625
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,079
Busted up the boy
Dimples, and them.

626
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,212
Yo, you wouldn't
have stood tall?

627
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,517
That's not what I'm saying.

628
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,423
It's not that you do shit,
It's how you do it.

629
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,927
Yo, look, I'm not
trying to stand around

630
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,659
and let no chump-ass
niggers think I'm shook.

631
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,530
I ain't.

632
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,802
And?

633
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,335
And I want you to sign up.

634
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,547
Colonel,
there's the matter of--

635
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,113
You find
yourself incompatible

636
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,852
with a certain lieutenant?

637
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,359
Detective Freamon,

638
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,794
you have carte blanche
in picking your squad.

639
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,322
In fact, you can pick your
supervisor for all I care.

640
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,135
Motherfucker,
as far as I'm concerned,

641
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,475
you are the Major
Crimes Unit.

642
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,572
It's morning
in Baltimore, Lester.

643
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,550
Wake up and smell the coffee.

644
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,383
Reinforcements?

645
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,289
Carver.

646
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,385
Damn, boy, what brings you
back to the plantation?

647
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,158
I trusted you. Trusted Daniels.
My fucking mistake, huh?

648
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,222
Whoa, hold up.
What's wrong?

649
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,699
The kid you were
supposed to protect,

650
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:57,928
you put his
name on the street.

651
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,766
They were beating him in
front of the school today,

652
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,431
stomping on him
for snitching.

653
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,030
- Jesus. He all right?
- It's always the same.

654
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,598
I should have fucking
seen this coming.

655
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,109
I swear to you,
I don't know what happened.

656
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,941
I hooked the kid into
Bunk Moreland and Herc.

657
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,777
I can't believe--

658
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,804
where's the kid now?

659
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,612
Home.

660
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,209
Let me go give this
to the night commander.

661
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,948
We'll park a plainclothes
unit on the house.

662
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,319
You think that
makes it better?

663
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,620
We'll be discreet, set up down
the block or some shit.

664
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,489
Come on inside.
I swear to you--

665
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,722
I'm gonna find out
what happened.

666
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,805
- Ed Bowers.
- Pleasure to meet you.

667
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:47,833
You surprised us all.

668
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,847
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
- Thanks.

669
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,439
I'd like to introduce
you to Dorothy.

670
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,245
You heard about Ed Nully?

671
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,411
I've heard great things about what
you've been doing, so keep it up.

672
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,647
I'm delighted you made it,
Mr. Mayor.

673
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,655
Well, it's for
a good cause, right?

674
00:35:58,689 --> 00:35:59,815
I am getting
the evil eye, however.

675
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,415
I gotta keep him circulating.

676
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,756
Okay.
This way.

677
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,784
- See you later.
- Take care.

678
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,782
The Washington crowd is driving
the local real estate market now,

679
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,341
and if the harbor promenade

680
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,944
could extend
to the south branch--

681
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,955
- We're looking at that.
- Should be.

682
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,854
Everything from here
to Hanover Street is money.

683
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,415
Mr. Mayor,
play a little poker?

684
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,949
I'm not very lucky.

685
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,461
Luck can change.

686
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,963
Mr. Mayor, I'd like you
to meet Ray Chandler.

687
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,988
Pleasure to meet you.

688
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,824
Boy, either you gonna do it,
or I'm gonna.

689
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,502
There's a reason the police
keep jumping out on you, Na'.

690
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,603
So, was it the Bunk's
cologne, huh?

691
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,112
Oh...
pussy.

692
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,613
I'm gonna miss you,
too, bitch.

693
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,616
Lester do love listening
to other people's

694
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,448
phone calls, don't you?
A bit of a pervert that way.

695
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,647
You could use
a wiretap case or two--

696
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,780
broaden your horizons.

697
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,450
Oh, no no.

698
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:44,086
The Bunk is strictly
a suit-and-tie motherfucker.

699
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,790
At all hazards, a man
must keep up appearances.

700
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,958
Dignity, I say.
Dignity above all,

701
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,467
Governor. Hear, hear!

702
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,935
Bunk,
you got a minute?

703
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,959
What's up?

704
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,131
The Wagstaff kid
I sent your way.

705
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,833
Wagstaff?
He one of mine?

706
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,307
Yeah, you were looking
for the boy Lex,

707
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,743
shot someone outside a nightclub
a couple of three months back.

708
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,906
This kid knew about
Lex getting killed.

709
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,745
Herc brought him to you.

710
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,751
Herc?

711
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,415
This kid is a witness,
and Herc was supposed

712
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,649
- to bring him to me?
- That was the plan.

713
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,487
I'm gonna skin
that motherfucker.

714
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:21,259
Jesus, Herc.
The fuck did you do?

715
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,460
Something happen to that boy?

716
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,365
Well, young man,
your wish has come true.

717
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,269
So this mean I can
finally get out of here?

718
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,241
Yes, Monnel, paperwork was slow
coming in from North Avenue,

719
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,640
but you five
are at the age

720
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,076
where we feel
it's to your advantage

721
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,636
to join your peers
in the ninth grade.

722
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,376
Yo, we in high school!

723
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,111
- When we bump?
- The end of this marking period.

724
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,743
Congratulations.

725
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,481
You're excused.

726
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,121
Mr. Johnson, you have a visitor
in the front office.

727
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,526
Mr. Johnson, please come
down to the front office.

728
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:52,790
Bad news?

729
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,627
Plenty more to go around.

730
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,657
They pulled the pin
on your program.

731
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,740
As I've been saying
this week at every roll call

732
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,006
in every damn district, if I could
scrape together any more, I would.

733
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,843
But for starters, it's a
5% salary year, and that's a given.

734
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,644
I know it's not half
what you deserve,

735
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,846
but if the revenue estimates stay good,
I promise you'll be seeing more.

736
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,188
Mr. Mayor,

737
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,385
my wife thanks you,
my children thank you,

738
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,553
my dog thanks you.

739
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,859
Hey, Santy, how you able to
tell your wife from your mutt?

740
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,956
His wife, she's the one
that's got the fleas.

741
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,092
Shit, Bobby,
with your old lady,

742
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,625
fleas would
be an improvement.

743
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,036
At ease. We got the mayor
here, gentlemen.

744
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,563
When they sit in one place
too long they get a little feisty.

745
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,372
I'm not going to stand here and
pretend I know how to do your job.

746
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,346
I don't. But what I can tell you
is that during the past few weeks

747
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,110
I have spoken with
many of your peers,

748
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,947
with your union reps, with
the representatives of the FOP,

749
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,317
and the biggest single
complaint I'm hearing

750
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,618
concerns the department's
obsession with stats.

751
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,123
The fucking numbers game.

752
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,558
Well, under my watch
the numbers game is over.

753
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,960
You will no longer be under
the gun to meet monthly quotas

754
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,988
of ineffective, meaningless
arrests and citations.

755
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,967
Thank you.

756
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,765
Excuse me, Your Worship.
You're not the first person

757
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,068
who stood at the podium
making promises.

758
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,131
Jimmy, I'm sure the mayor
has some pressing business.

759
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,472
No, I'm just saying,
the first community activist

760
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,000
who pitches a bitch about
the corner activity

761
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,477
in her neighborhood,

762
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,538
aren't we gonna go right back
to rounding up bodies?

763
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,549
Yeah, well, we need to educate
our citizens to the new approach.

764
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,483
Well, they're not the only
ones who need educating.

765
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,249
We got bosses that wouldn't know
police work if it bit 'em in the ass.

766
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,516
They been juking stats for years,
and they'll do it again

767
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,321
once the neighborhoods complain.
It's all they know.

768
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,987
Well, if the old dogs
can't get the job done,

769
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,996
I'll find new ones who can.

770
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,133
Look, for years I sat on
the back bench of the council

771
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,102
and watched our city
deteriorate.

772
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,502
It was business as usual
with the same old ideas

773
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,404
producing the same
old results.

774
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,841
Well, I'm here now, as you are,
and I'm asking you

775
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,004
to put aside your reservations
and give it a go.

776
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,008
All told.

777
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,152
You did good.

778
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,019
You got 'em pumped.
They love you.

779
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,286
Of course, the wrong
decision on Sergeant Hauk,

780
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,156
and who knows?

781
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,961
Carv said the kid had something
on it. I talked to him.

782
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,263
He had nothing,
just a bunch of hearsay

783
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,599
and some shit about zombies.

784
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,126
The boy was
to come to me.

785
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,298
You know the goddamn GO--
it's Homicide's call.

786
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,934
You don't go putting your paws
in my murder, you simple fuck.

787
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,443
Hey! You're talking
to a sergeant.

788
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,809
Oh, fuck your fucking stripes!

789
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,245
Whoa whoa,
take it easy, Bunk.

790
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,145
Now Herc is trying
to help us here.

791
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,911
Man, he messed
in my murder, he pays.

792
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,511
Give him a chance.
We can work something out.

793
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,317
That's easy for you to say.
You ain't the primary on this.

794
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,688
Motherfucker...

795
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,188
What got into him?

796
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,596
He's emotional.

797
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,862
He's been working this case
for a long time.

798
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,500
So the thing right now
is for you to remember

799
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,335
everything
you did on this case...

800
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,637
from the beginning.

801
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,445
He's out there,
hat in hand, literally.

802
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,219
Well, he can wait
till hell freezes over.

803
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,228
A wise man does not
burn his bridges

804
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,992
until he first knows
he can part the waters.

805
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,293
Old Ashanti saying.

806
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,993
Norman, you grew up
in Catonsville.

807
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,999
Show the motherfucker in.

808
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,572
Mr. Mayor,

809
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:37,075
I don't want to take time
out of your busy schedule.

810
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,522
Look, if this is about me countermanding
your orders for more arrests--

811
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,925
No, sir. You should proceed
as you feel the situation warrants.

812
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:47,522
Overall, policing strategies
may not be my strongest suit.

813
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,056
I'm here about
what I do know.

814
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,591
A recommendation from
Sergeant Hauk's commander

815
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,695
will cross your
desk tomorrow.

816
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,763
Colonel Daniels,
with Rawls concurring,

817
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,038
recommends sensitivity
training.

818
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,068
It may be
a fair decision,

819
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,637
it may even be
the right decision.

820
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,549
But we both know it won't
fly with the ministers,

821
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,951
not even with
Daniels behind it.

822
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,477
Hmm.

823
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,824
600 pages of rules,

824
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,455
regulations,
directives, orders.

825
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,803
You fire a white police
for a bad car stop

826
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,068
on a black minister, you'll
lose the rank and file.

827
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,474
It's not cause enough.
But if a commander can't find

828
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,707
grounds for firing
a saint in here...

829
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,478
The man has worked
Narcotics for six years,

830
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:46,319
and in Narcotics
there are no virgins.

831
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,325
And herein lies
your expertise?

832
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,293
Hmm.

833
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:54,195
I've always been comfortable
delegating strategic elements.

834
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,324
It's what
the Deputy Ops is for.

835
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:00,064
Me, I know what
a mayor needs.

836
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,770
- It was a Chevy Tahoe.
- Mm-hmm.

837
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,268
License Mike-460-654.

838
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,441
And I searched it good,
figuring I'd find some iron, but--

839
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,609
How'd they react?

840
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,983
Chris and Snoop?
They didn't do shit.

841
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,419
Was there anything
in the car?

842
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,786
Registration and crap
in the glove box,

843
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,519
empty chicken boxes, trash.

844
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,823
They had one of those
plastic milk crates--

845
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:25,954
Mm-hmm.

846
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,554
--in the back with
some tools in it.

847
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,587
What kind of tools?

848
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,259
I don't know,
carpenter tools.

849
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,131
Did you check the crate
for weapons?

850
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,636
Nail gun.

851
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,036
Nail gun?

852
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,539
Yeah, one of them bitches
that shoots nails.

853
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,801
They rig it to shoot
rounds maybe?

854
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,004
Naw, I shot it.
A nail came out.

855
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,481
Look, Lester, seriously,
is any of this helping?

856
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,144
Naw, you're doing good.

857
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,848
Tell me about jacking Marlo
at the train station.

858
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,759
I'm short four, right?

859
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,099
Yeah,
I remember your ass.

860
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,967
Here's my four.
You like that?

861
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,438
- Okay!
- I'm gonna beat your ass.

862
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,599
Okay, no more!
Stop stop stop stop.

863
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,108
Take the money,
take the money, all right?

864
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,235
Stop.

865
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,711
Make me work
this hard again,

866
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:16,940
I'm gonna
skin one of y'all!

867
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,313
Okay. Just go, man.

868
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:25,451
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.

869
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,790
You know who got the fattest
asses and the best pussy?

870
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,795
- Who that?
- Midgets, nigger.

871
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,660
They're all that,
you know what I'm saying?

872
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,994
The fuck happened
to our boy on the door?

873
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,367
Siesta, Papa.

874
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,838
You fix this, Joe?

875
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,405
What's the problem?

876
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,311
Ran out of time.

877
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,316
Now, Joe, you've been
so busy being devious,

878
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,012
you done messed around and got
yourself caught up in a web.

879
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,021
Omar, I don't know what
you been hearing, now--

880
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,317
Joe, ain't no time
for no lies now.

881
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,948
Now see, I need you
to be straight,

882
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,755
just like you did on that
New Day Co-op sit down.

883
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,092
Oh, yeah,
I know about that.

884
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,428
I know you the one got Marlo
up in this mess too.

885
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:11,025
Hey, Omar,
take a deep breath.

886
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,196
A proposition might fall
kindly on your ear.

887
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,967
Well, tickle my fancy,
fat man.

888
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,270
Money, drugs-- your call.

889
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,775
Come on, now, Joe,
you can do better than that.

890
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,108
Hey, we-- we coming
at this all wrong.

891
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,636
See, you the one
with the high card.

892
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,671
You should speak your mind.

893
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,620
You going to serve up Marlo.

894
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,315
You gonna take out
Marlo Stanfield?

895
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,257
No no, but I got
a real powerful urge

896
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,385
to take everything he owns,

897
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,021
and I'm quite confident you
the man can make that happen.

898
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,462
That might take some doing.

899
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,466
Naw naw, see,
we got to have it simple.

900
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,333
See, Omar like it simple.

901
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,804
So how we gonna
do this, yo?

902
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,467
Huh?

903
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,135
My sister's boy.

904
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,804
He do the drop.

905
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:59,475
We call you
and give up the spot.

906
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,916
- That simple enough?
- That's what it is.

907
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,115
See now, Joe, I need you to
resist your natural inclination

908
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,318
to do anything twisted up
in this here play. You feel me?

909
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,826
I even catch a whiff of you
doing something foul, Joe,

910
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,728
I mean, I might got to go
tell Marlo you the one

911
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:17,393
put me up on that card game.

912
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,334
We understood?

913
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,362
Now go ahead and write
my ticket so I can tip on out.

914
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,005
Come on now.

915
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,977
Gentlemen.

916
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,463
I'll see to Tremaine.

917
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,469
- You can't be serious.
- Was you listening?

918
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,801
Omar to one side
holding a spade,

919
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,639
and maybe Marlo
to the other with a shovel.

920
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,735
And just at this moment,

921
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,908
I managed to crawl out
my own damn grave.

922
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,941
No way do I crawl back in.

923
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,487
What the fuck was
you doing out here, man?

924
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,819
You trust him?

925
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,917
- I trust his fear.
- Now we go, si?

926
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,623
Not till I teach Prop Joe
a thing or two about devious.

927
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,626
We on him now.

928
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,271
Sorry, guys, that's all
I got to say. Talk to the mom.

929
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,936
I hear you, but we just came
from his foster mother's house,

930
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,775
and she said it was you
that told him not to talk.

931
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,440
She said you told her
to get a lawyer.

932
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,279
That's right.

933
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,945
All right, look,
something got messed up.

934
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:45,284
We know that,
but whatever else happened,

935
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:46,482
we got a murder here.

936
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:47,615
Even if it's off the record,

937
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,182
it would help us
just to talk to the boy.

938
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,285
If you understand
what happened here,

939
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,956
you know I'm not
gonna do that.

940
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,488
If you go at it like that,
then you end up

941
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,626
siding with the motherfuckers
doing the dirt.

942
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,502
No, I'm siding
with my kids.

943
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:08,409
You're right.
You're right.

944
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:12,575
For you,
the kids come first.

945
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,607
We'll find another road.

946
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,122
Well, glad this
is working out for you.

947
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,259
Oh, man, you two...

948
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,958
makin' me all
weepy and shit.

949
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,764
Be safe, guys.

950
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,894
All right.

951
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,528
Hey, Roland, man,

952
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:37,768
you know, I hate
coming all this way

953
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,436
and not getting
a little something...

954
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,809
you know,
for old times' sake?

955
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,683
The playground behind
Fulton and Monroe,

956
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,451
unit block.

957
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,187
He told this fella Lex
to meet a girl there.

958
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,620
That's all he did.

959
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,446
What's up, Shorty?
Can you give me three?

960
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,979
Bitch, get the fuck
across the street

961
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,989
and plant your ass
on a stoop.

962
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,820
Kenard!

963
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,452
Yo, how do you think I look
with no tail on my head?

964
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,486
Do I look like a faggy?

965
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,521
Yo, Na'.

966
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,174
Yo, Mrs. Lee,
you looking for Michael?

967
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,177
Um, Namond, I don't want
to be no trouble to you,

968
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,008
but I got this friend
who been ailing,

969
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,515
you know,
and she gave me $6.

970
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,313
So I was hoping you
could, you know...

971
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:03,284
Yeah, we cover her.
Go see my man.

972
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,123
The fuck you do that for?

973
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,096
It's Michael's moms, yo.

974
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,620
Shit, she
a fucking dope fiend.

975
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,292
Namond said I could. Na'?

976
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,630
Naw, it's cool.

977
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,192
Gimme Yellow Bird.

978
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,602
All right, but you ain't
got to be all up on me.

979
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,301
I know, I know!
I'm late, you know?

980
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:22,505
Sometimes it's just too much
damn fun being in charge.

981
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,150
Where you been, boss?

982
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,655
Announcing my presence
with authority.

983
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,351
Sorry I'm late.
Please sit down. Sit.

984
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,824
Sir, we scarfed up
52 vehicles.

985
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,193
Good.
But you missed my car.

986
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,832
We have new equipment
at school 45,

987
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,165
school 52, and school 58
installed.

988
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:49,832
Well, I got no calls on those, but keep
at it. You'll get there, I'm sure.

989
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:53,172
Mr. Mayor, all hydrants
are fully capped as of today,

990
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,576
and solid waste has
pulled 32 tons of trash

991
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,842
from the alleys, and, sir,
that's a single-day record.

992
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,348
That's what I want to hear.

993
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:02,442
Thank you, gentlemen,
and keep up the good work.

994
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:05,886
Finance, of course,
doesn't deal with

995
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,948
the dirt-under-
the-nails tangibles,

996
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:12,291
unless you consider the money
itself to be dirty.

997
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,820
- So what's in your agenda today?
- The school audit.

998
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,093
Well, how bad could that be?

999
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,658
The system is running
a $54 million deficit.

1000
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,831
54 million?

1001
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,467
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

1002
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:29,138
Jesus Christ.
Did Royce know this?

1003
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,841
How the fuck do we
deal with that?

1004
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,715
Frankly, I'm not
sure just yet.

1005
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,151
Our attendance is excellent,

1006
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,217
and as to suspensions,
we don't have any.

1007
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,489
We intervene immediately,

1008
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,497
and we show success
in stabilizing behavior.

1009
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,328
Not to mention the world of good
we're doing for the classes

1010
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,493
these kids were wrecking
before the program.

1011
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,003
In January we could
expand to four classes,

1012
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,504
cover the whole eighth grade.

1013
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,006
Any complaints about
the tracking,

1014
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,803
- anything from the parents?
- Not a one.

1015
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,436
This isn't a group where we see
a lot of parental intervention.

1016
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,638
What about test scores?

1017
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,374
I can't speak to
the program itself,

1018
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,905
but it has to help
the rest of the eighth grade.

1019
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,941
Next week will tell.

1020
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,722
Right now the system

1021
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,623
is under a lot of scrutiny.

1022
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,289
We have certain fiscal issues
that are of great concern

1023
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,629
to the new administration,
and what you're proposing here

1024
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,534
is a radical shift
in curricula.

1025
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,128
Meaning?

1026
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,105
If City Hall were
to sign off on this,

1027
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,368
we could go forward,

1028
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,309
but now
is not the time

1029
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,336
to rock any boats.

1030
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,583
Hear that?
That's my joint right there.

1031
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,999
So you all got your
work up to date, right?

1032
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,661
Yeah
yeah yeah.

1033
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,466
I heard you took care
of your puppy's problems.

1034
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:05,941
Oh, he most definitely made
that go away, you hear me?

1035
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,102
It's all good.

1036
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:09,441
You know, some of
the young'uns been saying

1037
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,606
your pup stood tall
with a snitchin' boy.

1038
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,607
Michael?

1039
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,278
Yeah, that's what
they saying.

1040
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,982
- Huh.
- Yeah.

1041
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,510
Lester, you really starting
to scare me, man.

1042
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,850
- Need a crowbar.
- For what?

1043
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,791
This is a tomb.

1044
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,453
Lex is in there.

1045
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:16,227
Oh...

1046
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,257
fuck me.
