2
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,460
<i>Before war...</i>

3
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,530
<i>New York...</i>

4
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,690
<i>Before I was born.</i>

5
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,960
<i>The place I've only seen pictures of.</i>

6
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>I know you...</i>

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,990
<i>but we've never meet.</i>

8
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,720
<i>I'm with you...</i>

9
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,550
<i>but I don't know your name.</i>

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,690
<i>I know I'm dreaming...</i>

11
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,520
<i>but it feels like more than that.</i>

12
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,060
<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,170
<i>How can that be?</i>

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,200
<i>March 14, 2077.</i>

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,800
<i>Five years since the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

16
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,600
<i>And I'm still haunted by these dreams.</i>

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,560
<i>Victoria and I were assigned together.</i>

18
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,180
<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be
finished, and we'll join the others.</i>

19
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,600
<i>But the questions I ask,
she doesn't.</i>

20
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,520
<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,850
<i>It's been half a century
since the scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

22
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,200
<i>Forced to leave their own dying planet,</i>

23
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,600
<i>they came to take ours.</i>

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,700
<i>Without the moon,
the Earth was thrown into chaos.</i>

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,100
<i>Earthquakes toppled cities within hours.</i>

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,960
<i>Tsunamis wiped out what we make.</i>

27
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,610
<i>Then came the invasion.</i>

28
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,250
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,240
<i>We used the nukes.</i>

30
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,690
<i>We won the war, but lost the planet.</i>

31
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,750
<i>Left it contaminated.</i>

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,160
<i>Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,300
<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the earth.</i>

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,390
<i>We built the Tet, our mission control.</i>

35
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,880
<i>The Temporary Space Station
before the migration to Titan.</i>

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,970
<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>

37
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,330
<i>Everyone's there now.</i>

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,900
<i>Well... almost every one.</i>

39
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,900
Thank you for the coffee.

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,290
<i>Remainants of the scavengers army
continue to disrupt the operation.</i>

41
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,480
<i>They attack our drones at night.</i>

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,110
<i>They try to kill me during the day.</i>

43
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,990
<i>They're still fighting them, but I don't know why.</i>

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,500
<i>Mission says we have done well.</i>

45
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,110
<i>And we are an effective team.</i>

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,340
<i>Vica's my communication officer.</i>

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,340
<i>She keeps an eye on me.</i>

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,730
<i>And I handle drone maintenance.</i>

49
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,630
<i>The drones watch everything.</i>

50
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,000
<i>Vica can't wait to go.</i>

51
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,130
<i>Me? I'm not so sure.</i>

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,370
<i>I can't shake the feeling that Earth,</i>

53
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,510
<i>in spite of all that's happened,
Earth is still my home.</i>

54
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,130
Jack Harper, Tech 49

55
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,750
Morning, Bob!

56
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,930
<i>Tower, call check!</i>

57
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,000
<i>Drone maintenance technician 49,
Hydro Rig support.</i>

58
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,080
All Bobby ship system are green.

59
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,260
I'm good to go.

60
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,830
Copy Tech-49, you're clear,
be careful out there.

61
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,940
- Always am.
- No, you're not.

62
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,520
You're right.

63
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,580
I gotta work on that.

64
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,499
Alright, Tet's coming online in 30 seconds.

65
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,370
Relay Hydro Rig coordinates now.
Contact visual.

66
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,900
I got them.
Hydro Rigs are sucking sea water.

67
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,830
You got them, Bob?

68
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,680
Drone 185 looks good.

69
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,600
Jack, we've got two drones down.

70
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,110
Shit!

71
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,430
Stand by! Mission coming online.

72
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,880
<i>Okay, Tet contact.</i>

73
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,730
Morning, boss.

74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,460
Tower 49, this is mission control.

75
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,620
How are you feeling this lovely morning?

76
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,480
Another day in paradise, Sally.

77
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,070
Uploading data now.

78
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,570
49 mission log, day 1642,
Hydro Rig support.

79
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,600
- I have two...
- Two drones offline,

80
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,640
perimeter's compromised.

81
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,950
Copy that. Relaying to Tet, stand by.

82
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,880
Jack. 166 is down in grid 37.

83
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,790
Linking to beacon now.

84
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,400
You go there first.

85
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,500
Got it. On my way.

86
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,430
Tech 49 is on route to grid 37 now.

87
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Can you plug that hole with drone 109?

88
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,640
Negative. 109 is in the dock.

89
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,410
Still waiting for parts.

90
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,840
Jack's better find those drones and get them flying.

91
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,950
Those rigs can't be exposed overnight.

92
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,130
Copy that.

93
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,080
Tower, did he fixed 166 recently?

94
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,030
Jack has fixed all the drones recently.

95
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,893
And if we had the parts
that we'd been asking for,

96
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,550
we wouldn't be running
a skeleton grid down here.

97
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,130
Understood. We're doing the best we can.

98
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,550
- Are you an effective team?
- We are an effective team.

99
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,289
Your directive today is to
rehabilitate 166 and find 172.

100
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,414
Get them flying by Sunday,

101
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:56,310
and I'll buy you two rounds of
drinks when you get up to the Tet.

102
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,690
You'd better be ready, Sally.
Two weeks now.

103
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,910
Well I'm keeping track.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,190
Well, glad to be here, buddy.

105
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,010
Tech-49.

106
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,010
Tech-49.

107
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,990
Jack?

108
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,299
Copy Tower.

109
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,800
What happened? I lost you for a second.

110
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,930
Really?

111
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,040
Coming up on location.

112
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,199
There it is.

113
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,590
We have multiple scav kills.

114
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,390
Drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.

115
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,470
Got any movement?

116
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,700
No sign of scavenger activity.

117
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,949
I've got a limited visibility here, Jack.
You should handle this mission.

118
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,950
<i>Copy that.</i>

119
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,320
I am coming in now.

120
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,040
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.

121
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,930
Always do.

122
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,990
You know, I've read about this game.

123
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,010
It was played right here.

124
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,340
The last Super Bowl.

125
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,680
- Please don't tell me it was a classic.
- Classic game.

126
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,840
Ahead by 4.

127
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,370
<i>The ball...</i>

128
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,070
It was on the 50 yard line.

129
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,990
Seconds left on the clock.

130
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,260
Ball was snapped.

131
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,480
QB fumbles.

132
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,280
Disaster.

133
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,180
Looks like the game is over.

134
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,145
I'm reading the whole
central core off alignment,

135
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:38,740
you don't have the necessary
tools down there.

136
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,580
<i>A new fuel cell's not gonna fix that.</i>

137
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,130
- But this QB runs back-
- Jack.

138
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,390
- <i>Picks up his own fumble.</i>
- Hold on, what did you just do?

139
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,130
<i>A wall of linebackers closing in on him.</i>

140
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,630
<i>So he throws a long ball,</i>

141
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,850
<i>with no idea who is at the other end.</i>

142
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,900
Hail Mary.

143
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,700
80,000 people on their feet,
watching this ball sail through the air!

144
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,170
And down field...

145
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,980
would be wild receiver, first strike,

146
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,090
just leaps out of the back...

147
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,590
Touch Down!

148
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,430
Contact! West contact!

149
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,430
Jack?

150
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,670
It's okay, Vica.

151
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,120
It's just a dog.

152
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,190
Now go away! Get out of here!

153
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,020
Go on! Get out of here! Go!

154
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,030
Tech 49 Jack Harper.

155
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,870
You're welcome.

156
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,280
166 back online.

157
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,700
<i>Two drones shot down today.</i>

158
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,300
10 fuel cell stolen in just over a month,

159
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,460
these scavs are getting bolder.

160
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,190
<i>Well, Hydro Rigs are taking all the bullshit.</i>

161
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,670
Once we're gone, they'll have
nothing but dust and radiation.

162
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

163
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,040
We won the war.
And we have to leave.

164
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,680
Two more weeks, Jack.

165
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,050
And we'll be on our way to Titan.

166
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,380
Yeah.

167
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,140
That drone is out there somewhere.

168
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,850
We just have to find him.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,120
Without a beacon, it's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

170
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,160
For it we go our ground game.

171
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,450
Tower.

172
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,460
Located 172...

173
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,800
in a sinkhole.

174
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,160
No visual but I can hear it.

175
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,920
Tet so far off angle, I can barely see you.
How does it look?

176
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,810
It's good! It's good! There's no sign
of scav activity on top.

177
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,595
<i>Tet's offline in 15 minutes.</i>

178
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,020
<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

179
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,469
<i>Mission, this is Tower 49.</i>

180
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,009
<i>Jack has located drone 172.</i>

181
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,920
<i>Engage recovery now.</i>

182
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,860
Requesting backup to his location ASAP.

183
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,109
I've got a visual on drone 172.

184
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,110
Jack?

185
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,990
What the hell?

186
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,990
Shit!

187
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:47,807
Jack!

188
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,380
Tech 49 Jack Harper.

189
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,960
Jack Harper Tech 49.

190
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,390
Oh, come on!

191
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,830
Not my goddamn bike!

192
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,819
"And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,

193
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,569
For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his Gods?"

194
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,570
Jack.

195
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,300
Yeah! I'll be right there.

196
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,700
<i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>

197
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,840
How does 109 look?

198
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,770
- Can it fly?
- Barely.

199
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,450
But without armor she's a sitting duck.

200
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,070
Well I'll talk to Sally about that
shielding in the morning.

201
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,760
Again.

202
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,480
What, Jack Harper?

203
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,680
Where did you get this?

204
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,850
It was growing, and...

205
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,058
Come on Jack, you know the regulations,

206
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,114
we don't need a mistake, we have
no idea what kind of toxins

207
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:49,010
could be on something like that.

208
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,960
- It's a flower, Vica...
- Yeah, that's not the point.

209
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,203
It's that we are so close to the end,

210
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:58,690
and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk.

211
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Okay.

212
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,660
Every day you have to go down there.

213
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,910
And see what was lost.

214
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,720
But we've done our job, Jack.

215
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,370
It's time to go.

216
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,410
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.

217
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,280
The Scavs.

218
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,310
They were trying to catch me.

219
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,530
I can't have you.

220
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,750
Come on.

221
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,980
You should come with me some time.
Before we leave.

222
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,310
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.

223
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,660
I'll show you something.

224
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,650
Oh, my God...

225
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,070
It was a six stage melt-down
from inside the Hydro Rigs core.

226
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,040
It's offline permanently.

227
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,780
Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.

228
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,980
I need to know exactly what happened.

229
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,263
Jack claims the scavs weaponised
one of the stolen fuel cells

230
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:06,590
and got it into the suction.

231
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,000
Tower, hold!

232
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,000
Tower?

233
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,679
I've got a rogue signal in grid 370.
You seeing this?

234
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Yes!

235
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,000
It's gotta be scav.

236
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,169
It's not one of ours.

237
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,170
Jack.

238
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,720
The signal's being directed off planet.

239
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,070
On my way.

240
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,589
Tower, our logs show, you are missing
an additional 9 fuel cells. Can you confirm?

241
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,240
Negative mission, that number is 10.

242
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,850
Drone 172 was lost last night.

243
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,650
109 is combat ready since you get that shield ring.

244
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,049
We can cover the remaining rigs with drones
in the field. I've run the numbers.

245
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,830
We're using the numbers in the field, Tower.

246
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,089
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.

247
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,989
Copy.

248
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,200
Our job is to run those rigs,
your directive is to maintain them.

249
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,620
We cannot afford to lose another.

250
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,199
Do you copy?

251
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Copy.

252
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,679
Are you and Jack an effective team?

253
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,880
Damn right, we are!

254
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Jack?

255
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,420
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?

256
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Jack?

257
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,890
Yeah, I got it.

258
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,190
It's some kind of repeater.

259
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,350
The scavs are using a
building as an antenna.

260
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,820
Can you decrypt?

261
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,530
It's a sort of coordinates.

262
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,670
Grid 17.

263
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,480
It's a goddamn holy beacon.

264
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,240
Grid 17.

265
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,530
What the hell is out there?

266
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,900
Nothing!
It's in the middle of nowhere!

267
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,910
What is going on?

268
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,870
Why would the scavs
send a signal off planet, Jack?

269
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,900
I'm shutting it down.

270
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,710
Tech-49, check your course.
You're headed right for the border.

271
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,960
That radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it.

272
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,490
It's okay Vica, I see it.

273
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,850
I'm gonna do a perimeter check...

274
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,840
before I head home.

275
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,460
I may go off comm.

276
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,300
Jack, we should keep in contact.
Just let me know where you are.

277
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,120
Do you copy?

278
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,970
Jack, do you copy?

279
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,680
That's right, Bob.

280
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,680
You know where we're going!

281
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,500
You're gonna miss me?

282
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,080
I'm gonna miss this place.

283
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,910
It would've been great.

284
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,600
Vica! Vica, did you get that?

285
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,140
Jack, where have you been?

286
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,500
An object came down in 17.

287
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,040
That's the beacon coordinates.

288
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,920
- Exactly.
- I saw it...

289
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,132
It's some sort of vessel.

290
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,540
- Jack, Mission's almost offline.
- I'm under it now.

291
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,389
Mission, we have an unidentified
object impact in 17,

292
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,200
it came down to coordinates sent by
a scav beacon. My tech's on route now.

293
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,870
Tower, we're going offline soon,

294
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,340
but drones are already mobile and executing.

295
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,890
Have your tech stand down.

296
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Copy.

297
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,990
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.

298
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,140
That's a negative, Tower!

299
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,190
With Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.

300
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,730
I want to know this site is secure!

301
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,550
Sally, my Tech is concerned
about the security of the site.

302
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,810
Tower, you have lost enough assets for today.

303
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,120
- Keep your tech out of it. Do you copy...?
- Copy. Command, I...

304
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,119
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this!

305
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,720
I'm on site.

306
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,870
Jack, the drones have eyes on you.

307
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,730
Command's offline.

308
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,060
I think it's one of ours.

309
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,860
This thing is ancient, it looks...

310
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,260
pre-war!

311
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,750
This is scavs, they brought this thing down, Jack!

312
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:09,359
There's no sign of scavs.

313
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,120
Technician, this is your control.
I order you to pull out

314
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,420
and return to the Tower immediately.

315
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,480
Touching down!

316
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,380
They are human!

317
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,520
Tower, we've got survivors.

318
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,240
There are four, check it, five survivors.

319
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,240
They are human!

320
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,600
Stand down!

321
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,070
- Vica, the drones are firing at survivors.
- Jack, the Tet's offline, I...

322
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,730
I don't have control!

323
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
Stand down!

324
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,440
Jack Harper, Tech-49

325
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,480
Back off, you son of a bitch!

326
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Back off!

327
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,510
Open the door!

328
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,490
Vica!

329
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,740
Get the med case.

330
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,830
Get the med case!

331
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,810
This has to be reported.

332
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,290
Then you should report that the drones
killed the crew from one of our own ships.

333
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,240
See what Command makes of that.

334
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,760
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.

335
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,650
Jack...

336
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,090
Here. You're still dehydrated.

337
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,120
Where are we?

338
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,270
I'm Victoria.

339
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,470
This is Jack.

340
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,590
What's your name?

341
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,710
Julia.

342
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,300
Julia...

343
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,310
I'm sorry for what I have to tell you...

344
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,700
But you were on a crash.

345
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,500
Your ship came down.

346
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,590
Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.

347
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,240
But none of your crew survived.

348
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,140
What do you mean?

349
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,610
You're the only one that made it.

350
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,350
I'm sorry.

351
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,350
You've been in delta sleep for a long time.

352
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,250
Some disorientation is normal.

353
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,520
How long?

354
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,030
60 years.

355
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,520
At least.

356
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,390
I have to get back to the ship.

357
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,920
It's too dangerous down there,
you need to rest.

358
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Vica...

359
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,250
Don't touch me!

360
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,709
Your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon.

361
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,010
From the surface.

362
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,170
You know anything about that?

363
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,710
What was your mission?

364
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,760
It's classified.

365
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,300
But we have no record of an Odyssey's...

366
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,709
I can't tell you anything until I get
the flight recorder from my ship.

367
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,830
Julia,

368
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,980
a lot's changed in 60 years.

369
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,940
When you were in delta sleep,

370
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,610
Earth was attacked.

371
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,560
We call them scavs.

372
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,540
They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

373
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,820
Then they invaded.

374
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,980
We won the war.

375
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,190
But Earth was ruined.

376
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Everyone's on Titan now.
That's the moon of Saturn, we're on the...

377
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,730
space station getting ready to go.

378
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,580
We're here for the security
and drone maintenance.

379
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,470
We're the mop-up crew.

380
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,530
You lost people. Everything.

381
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,990
If you want to be alone, we understand.

382
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:20,640
The drones killed her entire crew.

383
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,839
- If I hadn't gotten there...
- I want her gone first thing.

384
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Vica...

385
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:33,430
Do you have any memories before the mission?

386
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,200
Before the security wipe?

387
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,950
Our job is not to remember.

388
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,650
Remember?

389
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,950
Do you remember her?

390
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:51,950
Jack...

391
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:57,360
That was a scav beacon that brought her down.

392
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,970
We don't know who she is.

393
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,010
Or what she is.

394
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,340
Let's just get trough the night.

395
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,570
Okay?

396
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,980
You fly that thing?

397
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,820
Yes.

398
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,980
What happens now?

399
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,460
Tet will be online soon...

400
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,570
Victoria will report your rescue.

401
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,340
And they'll send someone down for you.

402
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,879
From the Tet?

403
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
Yes.

404
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,540
I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.

405
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,180
The scavs, they move at night.

406
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:31,230
- They could be all over...
- I need to know what happened.

407
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,860
You need to know what happened.

408
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,110
Please!

409
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,470
Jack. What are you doing?

410
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,289
Vica, she is a flight officer.

411
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,140
She wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder.

412
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:12,480
- Now you'd want the same thing.
- Jack...

413
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,080
I can't protect you.

414
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,180
Yeah, I understand.

415
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,810
This one's on me.

416
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,800
I couldn't save them.

417
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,300
Jack. Jack!

418
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,490
Jack, can you hear me?

419
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,719
Alright, it's time to go.

420
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,920
Jack!

421
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,920
I found it.

422
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,110
Jack!

423
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,700
Tower 49, how are you all this lovely morning?

424
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,140
Another day in paradise.

425
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,299
Sally...

426
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,300
Jack...

427
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,160
took a pre-doom patrol,

428
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,380
and...

429
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,570
went off comm.

430
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,370
Near the canyons in 17.

431
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,510
Now, I know we're low on drones.

432
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,680
But, um...

433
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,430
Requesting one to sweep the area.

434
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,680
Just a quick scout!

435
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:10,440
Copy 49, tasking 185 to grid 22.

436
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:48,439
And how can a man die better
Than facing fearful odds,

437
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,439
For the ashes of his fathers,

438
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
And the temples of his gods?

439
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,540
I've been watching you, Jack.

440
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,090
You're curious.

441
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,970
What are you looking for in those books?

442
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,200
Maybe it will bring back old memories?

443
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,650
You won't get anything from me.

444
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,380
My memory's been wiped to protect...

445
00:54:27,381 --> 00:54:28,880
Security of your mission? Yes.

446
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:37,420
You can't have your precious memory
falling into the wrong hands, now can you?

447
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,940
Tell me.

448
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,070
Have you ever met a...

449
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:44,570
Scav up-close?

450
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,980
Of course not.

451
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,720
You just repair drones.

452
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,160
Don't go in to the radiation zone.

453
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,000
Don't ask too many question.

454
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:01,650
A part of the job description.

455
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,960
Lights!

456
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,770
We are not aliens, Jack.

457
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,740
We are human.

458
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,040
Of course for us, being human is a problem.

459
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,340
Old steel fighter tech.

460
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,760
Shielder from your scanners.

461
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,020
Focus scrambler.

462
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:51,760
Keeps your drones confused.

463
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,900
Well...

464
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,040
Most of the time.

465
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,840
- The drones are programmed...
- To kill humans, Jack!

466
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,150
You saw what they did to those sleep box.

467
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,119
You almost got yourself

468
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,120
blown to bits protecting that woman.

469
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,700
Why did you do that?

470
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,580
Anyone would have.

471
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,430
Anyone?

472
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,550
- Interesting...
- We're wasting our time.

473
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,590
The drone will track him here.

474
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,670
Sergeant Sykes.

475
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:29,480
He thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.

476
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,440
I hope you'll prove him wrong.

477
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,436
Mission, I'm picking up a biotrack
somewhere near the west canyons,

478
00:56:51,437 --> 00:56:52,670
can you confirm the sequence?

479
00:56:52,671 --> 00:56:54,470
Stand by.

480
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,380
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.

481
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,130
Vica, you're okay?

482
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,700
Everything good between you two?

483
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,100
Of course!

484
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,960
You're still an effective team?

485
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,880
We're great!

486
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,570
Never better.

487
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,320
We were running a ground
game and losing.

488
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,260
So we decided, what the hell.

489
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,980
We gotta throw the long ball.

490
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:25,660
It took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.

491
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,390
That's how you brought down the Odyssey.

492
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Why?

493
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,200
The Odyssey's compact reactor.

494
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:39,620
Courtesy of NASA, very hard to come by.

495
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,570
You liked the show last night?

496
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,810
And it was just one fuel cell.

497
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,890
Imagine what 10 of them will do.

498
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:56,860
With the core of weapon's grade plutonium.

499
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,340
We have a nuke.

500
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,580
We have a drone to carry it.

501
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,960
But we can't access it.

502
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,750
It doesn't know who we are.

503
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,160
But it knows you, Jack.

504
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,430
We need you to program the drone

505
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,260
that will carry our nuke to the Tet.

506
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:33,650
End this war.

507
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,740
There are people up there.

508
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,920
Sergeant...

509
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,540
Program the drone to return to the Tet.

510
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,310
It needs to go right to the center.

511
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,910
Screw you!

512
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:56,800
We haven't got time for this.

513
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,510
No!

514
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,420
- Let's go!
- Get him out.

515
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:44,889
- 185 just went off grid.
- Copy Tower, we're seeing the same thing.

516
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,030
Permission to task two additional drones?

517
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:52,170
If one drone is here, more will come.

518
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,700
They won't stop till they find me.

519
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,019
They'll turn this place to dust.

520
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,930
But if you let us go, I'll call them off.

521
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,500
It's your only chance.

522
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:27,450
I've been to your radiation zone.

523
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,920
If you're looking for the truth...

524
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:34,170
that's where you're gonna find it.

525
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,300
You risk all our lives.

526
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,020
Everything.

527
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,650
Why do you think he is different?

528
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,600
She does!

529
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,880
Mission,

530
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,890
I found my tech over 37.

531
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,390
You can call off the search.

532
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,920
Copy that Tower, glad Jack's safe.

533
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:04,590
Tasking the unit drones, back to rig support.

534
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,740
Where're we going?

535
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,500
Who are you?

536
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,650
What aren't you telling me?

537
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:43,740
- Jack...
- What were you doing on the Odyssey?

538
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,810
What was your mission?

539
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:51,410
It's was a research flight to Titan.

540
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,870
My first.

541
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,620
That's what it was supposed to be!

542
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,950
Six weeks to launch, deep space scanners
picked up an alien object.

543
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:05,370
We were re-assigned to investigate.

544
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,700
They put us all in delta. They must have...

545
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:15,110
woken you and Victoria first.

546
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:17,550
What?

547
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,830
That object...

548
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,220
was the Tet, Jack.

549
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:26,670
The Tet was our mission.

550
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,560
That's impossible!

551
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:33,530
That's impossible!

552
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,330
Who are you?

553
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:43,460
I'm your wife...

554
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:48,290
I don't know what happened!

555
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:52,820
But you're not who you think you are.

556
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,690
Jack, we were here.

557
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,190
You asked me to meet you.

558
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,850
You brought me up on top of the world.

559
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,020
I could tell you were nervous that day.

560
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,520
It was right here, Jack.

561
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,710
You said...

562
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,320
Look through here...

563
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,000
And I'll show you the future.

564
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,810
And I hold up a ring.

565
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,900
- And you said...
- Yes!

566
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,860
There you are.

567
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,930
There you are.

568
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:47,460
Vica, I'm coming in!

569
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,050
Do not report to Mission
till I get back, do you copy?

570
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,000
Do you copy?

571
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,020
Vica, open the door.

572
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,210
Stay away from me.

573
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,570
I don't want to hear.

574
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:25,380
It not safe here, and we need to leave now.

575
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,950
It was always her.

576
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,270
Wasn't it?

577
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,100
Vica...

578
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:45,300
She's my wife.

579
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:02,010
Mission, this is Tower 49.

580
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,630
Go ahead, 49.

581
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,100
- No...
- I'm having a problem with my technician.

582
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,050
- You don't know what are you doing!
- He found a survivor on the crash site.

583
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,900
- Vica, listen to me!
- She's impeding his abilities.

584
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,720
And he's unfit for service.

585
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,820
I'm sorry to hear that, Vica.

586
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:24,630
Are you still an effective team?

587
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,170
Vica...

588
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,650
Open the door, Vica!

589
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,490
No.

590
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,270
We are not an effective team.

591
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,570
Vica, please.

592
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,759
You know we have to go now.

593
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,820
No, I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack!

594
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,570
There's a place I know...

595
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,190
We'll be safe.

596
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,060
I'm going to Titan.

597
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,050
There is no Titan.

598
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,450
They were lying to us.

599
01:10:15,451 --> 01:10:17,450
Just stay away from me!

600
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,490
Vica, please.

601
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:23,500
There are things...
Things you need to know.

602
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,730
I don't want to know.

603
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,600
Jack.

604
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,770
Hi, Jack.

605
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:15,440
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

606
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,420
What have you done?

607
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:19,950
You can't blame yourself for this.

608
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,600
Drones are unreliable.

609
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,060
Sometimes things go wrong.

610
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:26,170
Go wrong?

611
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,210
You killed her.

612
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,720
I know.

613
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,160
It's tragic.

614
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,410
She was a wonderful person.

615
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:38,830
Jack, we want to bring you here.

616
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:43,560
I've been authorized to tell you,
we're going to asign you a new mission.

617
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,690
You and the survivor.

618
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,710
There's a lot of interest up here.

619
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:55,850
Bring her up.

620
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:59,200
We can debrief and anything's possible!

621
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,740
It's time to go home, Jack.

622
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,300
Jack?

623
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,100
Jack...

624
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,250
Jack.

625
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:23,250
I'm sorry.

626
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,190
Hang on!

627
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,740
Lightning.

628
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,930
That's the plan.

629
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,320
We need cover!

630
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,320
There!

631
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:28,289
Are you okay?

632
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,690
No!

633
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:42,470
Don't worry, here we're staying out of there.

634
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:53,230
- Are we gonna die?
- No!

635
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,430
Maybe.

636
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:00,130
Jack!

637
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,380
Son of a bitch!

638
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,790
Wait here!

639
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,890
Who is he?

640
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:12,050
Hey!

641
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:13,890
Wait!

642
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,790
Wait!

643
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,550
Drop your weapon!

644
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,440
Easy.

645
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,120
It's okay!

646
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,280
Don't move!

647
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:07,889
You have to shut that drone down.

648
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:09,589
Stop moving!

649
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,590
Jack!

650
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:19,000
It's okay!

651
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:41,250
Julia!

652
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:45,250
Julia!

653
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:57,880
Don't touch me.

654
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,200
Hold on!

655
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,200
Just hold on!

656
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,470
Jack Harper.

657
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,820
Tech-52.

658
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,300
There you are.

659
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:12,270
What's happening? Are you okay?

660
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:17,380
I thought when you came across
the border that I lost you.

661
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,690
False alarm.

662
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,217
I should get back out there to...

663
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:29,360
You come all the way home
and I don't get a kiss?

664
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:42,360
What's going on up there?

665
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,000
I was thinking...

666
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,200
Why don't you come down with me?

667
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:50,830
To the surface.

668
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,620
We can go right now.

669
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,500
Now?

670
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,490
Yeah.

671
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,700
Are you serious?

672
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:04,410
You won't believe what's down there.

673
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,040
Jack...

674
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,999
You know the regulations.

675
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Yes.

676
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:19,580
Can we not do this again,
I'm done talking about it.

677
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,580
Okay.

678
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,460
This is gonna hurt.

679
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:26,440
Hell of a day, huh, Bob?

680
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,920
You always loved this song.

681
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,010
I'm not him.

682
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,450
I know I'm not...

683
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,110
But I've loved you...

684
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:15,940
For as long as I can remember.

685
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,320
I don't know how else to say it.

686
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:26,920
You know what you said to me once?

687
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:32,900
You said, when it was all over,
you'd build me a house on the lake.

688
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:37,350
We'd grow old and

689
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,940
fat together.

690
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,570
Then we would fight.

691
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:46,020
Maybe drink too much.

692
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,220
Real romantic.

693
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:55,610
And then we would die.

694
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:00,240
And be buried in the meadow by the lake.

695
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,820
And the world would forget about us.

696
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:12,160
But we would always have each other.

697
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,310
I remember.

698
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,470
Those memories are yours, Jack.

699
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,440
They are ours.

700
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,560
They are you.

701
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:30,470
Good morning.

702
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:40,110
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.

703
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,860
You still can.

704
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:47,730
I have to go.

705
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,720
Those people need my help.

706
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:00,890
We'll come back when it's over.

707
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:03,710
Promise me.

708
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,710
We'll come back when it's over.

709
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,490
You had me worried for a second.

710
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:51,180
I thought you weren't coming back.

711
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:55,670
Well, I had to prove him wrong.

712
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:59,760
You look like shit.

713
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,340
You should see the other guy.

714
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:08,420
If I told you, what you'd find out there,
you'd have thought I was crazy.

715
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,530
I still do.

716
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:15,460
- Malcolm Beech.
- Julia Harper.

717
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,510
Come on...

718
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,470
Mission, I'm picking up a biotrack
somewhere near the west canyons,

719
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,280
can you confirm the sequence?

720
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,400
Stand by.

721
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,590
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.

722
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:44,140
Mission, 185 just went off grid.

723
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:47,030
Copy Tower, we're seeing the same thing.

724
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:01,660
I'd been in the army less than a year
when that unholy thing arrived.

725
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,850
Saw the moon get taken up.

726
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:07,160
Right up here in the night sky.

727
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,170
Couldn't believe it.

728
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,490
After that, nature took over.

729
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:22,050
There's bed rocks around Chicago, so we were
spared the worst of the waves... quakes.

730
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:26,230
Most people just starved.

731
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:30,010
And the Tet set crew ships down.

732
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:32,740
The door is opened...

733
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,990
And out you came.

734
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,680
Astronaut Jack Harper.

735
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:44,660
Thousands of you.

736
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,860
Memory wiped.

737
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,500
Programmed to kill.

738
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,970
They had taken one of our best...

739
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:58,390
turned him against us.

740
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,290
No soul.

741
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,470
No humanity.

742
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:11,630
The Tet...

743
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:15,490
what a brilliant machine.

744
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:20,670
Feeding off one planet after another for energy.

745
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:23,890
Phase two.

746
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,720
Was drones repairmen.

747
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:35,710
50 years of watching those
Hydro Rigs suck our planet dry.

748
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:38,380
Then one day,

749
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,300
I saw you sat down.

750
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,700
Another the drone to fix.

751
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,230
But in the rubble that day

752
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:51,400
was a book.

753
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:54,000
You picked it up.

754
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,660
You studied it.

755
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,270
And I...

756
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:02,950
thought I saw a way.

757
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:08,230
When you stepped in front of that
drone and saved here...

758
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,900
I knew.

759
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:14,690
You were in there, somewhere.

760
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:20,290
I just had to find a way to bring you back.

761
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,380
Watch it.

762
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:47,160
Give it some space.

763
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:49,860
Come on, you're making it nervous.

764
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,690
That is one pissed off weapon.

765
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:59,740
No, it's just a machine.

766
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:24,150
Oh, I would love to be there
to see that thing's face when this goes off.

767
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:27,109
That would be a one way trip.

768
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,110
Yeah...

769
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,210
But it'd be worth it.

770
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:52,680
Welcome back, commander.

771
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,420
Open the door!

772
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:01,370
- Shit!
- Spread out!

773
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,870
I'm okay.

774
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:20,070
The drone.

775
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:23,070
Send the drone.

776
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:28,580
It's going in.

777
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,120
I though we had it.

778
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:36,140
I really did.

779
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:40,620
I can take the bomb myself.

780
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:44,850
You know it will swat you like a fly.

781
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:47,070
Not if I go.

782
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:50,490
No.

783
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:54,950
She asked you to bring me up.

784
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:58,490
So bring me up.

785
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:03,210
We'll go together.

786
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:21,430
It reminds me of home.

787
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,640
Ready?

788
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:11,490
Jack.

789
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,960
Dream of us.

790
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:25,790
Flight recorder, play back for the Odyssey mission.

791
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:28,340
3-8, 2017.

792
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:30,230
Okay, Bob.

793
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:33,050
Ready for space.

794
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:47,680
Good morning, Odyssey,
from your friends here in mission control.

795
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,260
Morning, Mission!
This is commander Jack Harper.

796
01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:52,300
Thank you for that fantastic wake up call.

797
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:54,110
Pre rendez-vous checks complete,

798
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:57,190
electrical guidance and nav systems are all good.

799
01:44:57,370 --> 01:45:00,790
Range behind object 250 clicks.

800
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:04,450
Twelve below V bar closer rate 200 kilometers per hour.

801
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,760
Copy that.

802
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:07,570
It's good to see you, Jack.

803
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:11,470
After the very last days of sleep,
sounds like you're ready to go.

804
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,320
Oh, I'm ready to go.

805
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:15,850
Your next battle will bring you
up level and to speed

806
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:18,880
at 50 kilometer range where you'll hold.

807
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:23,170
Copy, we go 50 clicks from object
for sensor scanned evaluation.

808
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:25,390
Targets look good.

809
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,070
Initiating burn in 3...
2... 1... Ignition.

810
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:35,780
I see a good burn.

811
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:38,090
Are you reading any output from the object?

812
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:42,110
Negative, zero heat. No MR.

813
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,400
There's no sign of life.

814
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:45,230
How is the rest of the crew doing?

815
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,880
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen should join me shortly.

816
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:51,300
Rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.

817
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:53,020
Copy that.

818
01:45:53,021 --> 01:45:55,420
You missed a hell of a game last night.

819
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,430
Well I tell you guys no spoilers
about last nights game.

820
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:00,930
I'm looking forward to watch it when I get back.

821
01:46:01,090 --> 01:46:03,030
You're not talking about football already, are you?

822
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:05,730
- Good morning, Vica.
- Good morning, Sally.

823
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:07,880
How are you doing this lovely morning?

824
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:10,040
Another day in paradise.

825
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:19,430
For the history.

826
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:33,600
Tech-49.

827
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:36,010
I have you on approach.

828
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,410
Hello, Sally.

829
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,120
It's a busy morning, huh?

830
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:45,550
I'm picking up a second passenger, Jack.

831
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:50,200
It's Julia Rosakova.

832
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:54,080
Female survivor from the crashed module.

833
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,790
Stay your intention.

834
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:59,160
Deliver the survivor

835
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:00,790
as requested.

836
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:02,660
We are

837
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:06,790
more effective team.

838
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,260
Proceed entering.

839
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,930
Mission, we got a situation.

840
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:23,240
The last burn was spot on to give us
a 50 click hold from object.

841
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:25,930
But radar range still decreasing.

842
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,430
We are accelerating toward the object.

843
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:31,180
We're gonna need full house burn to pull away.
Initiate now.

844
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,620
Enter target.

845
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:36,140
- Set.
- Target's good.

846
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,170
- All forward engines.
- Engines on.

847
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:39,950
Ready? Let's go!

848
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,770
Mission, we're on full house burn,
trying to back out.

849
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:55,260
There's a lot of vibration.

850
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:57,370
We're not getting away
from this thing.

851
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,890
Odyssey, telemetry shows structural over-stress.

852
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:01,620
Shut off the burn. Do you copy?

853
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,250
Getting off burn.

854
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:09,500
Mission?

855
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:11,380
Sally?

856
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,420
Increased acceleration toward the object.

857
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:17,230
Estimating contact within two minutes.

858
01:48:22,210 --> 01:48:24,780
I'm going to eject the sleep module.

859
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:27,050
It's programmed for insertion
into Earth orbital.

860
01:48:27,051 --> 01:48:30,080
Now flight command module oughta
vibrate free.

861
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,230
- I want you back there now.
- Absolutely not.

862
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,710
- That's an order.
- Jack, no, we're team!

863
01:48:57,090 --> 01:48:59,930
We gotta go, Jack! 30 seconds!

864
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:04,610
Dream of us.

865
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:46,630
Jack...

866
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,470
Tech-49, enter at headway speed.

867
01:50:07,290 --> 01:50:09,270
Entering at headway.

868
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:27,890
Welcome back.

869
01:50:28,290 --> 01:50:30,960
Don't go all shaky on me.

870
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:09,750
Jack, I can't help notice your respiration
and heart rate have increased.

871
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:13,650
I'm just exited to finally meat you, Sally.

872
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:18,699
There's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.

873
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:20,200
Yeah.

874
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:23,640
I feel bad about that.

875
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:28,870
Your voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.

876
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:32,590
Tell me why you're here.
You have 5 seconds.

877
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:43,210
I want Julia to live.

878
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:46,790
And our species to survive.

879
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:50,040
This is the only way.

880
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:59,200
Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.

881
01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:00,130
Welcome home, Jack.

882
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:18,150
Jack, you're doing the right thing.

883
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:20,380
I don't know what you are

884
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,130
or where you're from, but...

885
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:26,500
How about I tell about something I've read.

886
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:29,180
A story.

887
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:31,550
From Rome.

888
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:33,880
A city you destroyed.

889
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,140
It's a classic.

890
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:38,880
There was a guy...

891
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:41,230
Horatius.

892
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:44,450
He held the bridge alone against a whole army.

893
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:47,240
And what Horatius said was:

894
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,690
"How can a man die better..."

895
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:51,690
You don't have to die, Jack.

896
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,200
She doesn't have to die.

897
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:56,310
Everybody dies, Sally.

898
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:58,730
The thing is to die well.

899
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:12,080
Jack, that's not the survivor you've promised me.

900
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:14,570
No, it's not!

901
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,280
And what

902
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:40,870
Horatius said was:

903
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:45,140
"How can a man die better"

904
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:48,330
Than facing fearful odds,

905
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:52,790
Drone! Get inside! Get inside!

906
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,860
For the ashes of his fathers,

907
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:00,800
"And the temples of his Gods?"

908
01:55:18,730 --> 01:55:21,720
Fuck you, Sally!

909
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,260
<i>Earth</i>

910
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,650
<i>after the war.</i>

911
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:21,190
<i>3 years have passed since I saw your face.</i>

912
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:26,340
<i>I wonder if I come to you at night in dreams.</i>

913
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:28,300
<i>And the day</i>

914
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:30,960
<i>as memories.</i>

915
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,770
<i>Do I haunt your hours</i>

916
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:36,220
<i>the way you haunted mines?</i>

917
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:39,830
<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

918
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:42,720
<i>when you look at her.</i>

919
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,730
Mommy, look!

920
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:02,960
<i>If we have souls,</i>

921
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:07,060
<i>they're made of the love we share.</i>

922
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:11,700
<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

923
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:15,380
<i>Unbound by death.</i>

924
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:35,880
<i>For 3 years I searched for the house he built.</i>

925
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:40,670
<i>I knew it had to be up there.</i>

926
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:45,050
<i>Because I know him.</i>

927
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:55,230
<i>I am him.</i>

928
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:59,210
Who is that?

929
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:09,450
<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

930
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:13,630
<i>And I am home.</i>

931
01:58:13,655 --> 01:58:18,655
