1
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:54,412
[Doctor]
Um... you have no actual
medical training?

2
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:59,550
No. I have kids.
Learned a lot right there.

3
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,460
I mean, I've seen nurses
give my son throat cultures.

4
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,830
What is it?
You stick a giant Q-Tip
down their throat and wait.

5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,235
Or a urinalysis, where you
take a dipstick to see whether
or not the white count's high.

6
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,239
[Doctor]
Yes, I understand.
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:18,004
I'm great with people.
You'd have to observe me
to know for sure,

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,706
but you can trust me
on that.

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,714
Yeah.
I'm an extremely
fast learner.

10
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:26,377
You show me
something in a lab once,
and I've got it down.

11
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,822
Mm-hmm.
I always wanted to go
to medical school.

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,085
That was my first
interest really,

13
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,095
but then I got married
and had a kid too young
and that kind of blew that.

14
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,097
When I was first out
of high school,

15
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,828
I got a job
with Fleuer Engineers
and Constructors in Irvine.

16
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,065
I fell madly in love
with geology.

17
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,302
Geology?
[Erin]
Yeah.

18
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,309
I learned how to read maps.
I love maps.

19
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,540
Yeah, but I lost my job
because...

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,777
my boy came down
with the chicken pox,
had a 104 temperature,

21
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,979
and my ex-husband
was useless, so...

22
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,988
[Softly]
That didn't
really work out.

23
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,425
Uh-huh.

24
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,962
You got
a really nice office.

25
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,929
Thanks.

26
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,771
Look...

27
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,906
Aw, fuck.

28
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,908
[Sighs]

29
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:05,039
- [Nail Break]
- Goddamn it.

30
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,289
[Sighs]

31
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,668
[Starts Engine]

32
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:47,282
Good morning,
Mr. Masry.
Good morning,
Rosalind.

33
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,385
How are you doing today?
Fine, thanks.
And you?

34
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:52,453
Very well.
Thank you for asking.

35
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:54,465
Good morning.

36
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,502
Good morning.

37
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:02,301
How ya doing?
Hi, Donald.

38
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:05,502
[Brenda]
Did you see it last night?
I was out, but I taped it.

39
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:09,172
Don't tell me what happens.
It was so good.
Your 9:00's here already.

40
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:21,617
Remind me.
Erin Brockovich.

41
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,627
Car accident.
Not her fault, she says.

42
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:27,625
She was referred.

43
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,303
Yeah.
All right?

44
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,271
Erin, hi.

45
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,433
Hi.
[Closes Door]
Ed Masry.

46
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,807
Sorry you had to wait.

47
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:43,974
That's okay.
Here, sit, sit.
Sit down, sit down.

48
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:55,381
Thank you.

49
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,690
Oh.

50
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,822
I never thought just standing
could take it out of you,

51
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,924
but ever since
that shithead hit me,

52
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,935
I feel like my whole body's
put together wrong.

53
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:07,437
You poor thing.

54
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,441
Uh, did anyone ask
if you wanted coffee?

55
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,945
Yeah. I'm fine.
[Clears Throat]
[Ed] Good.

56
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:18,711
Listen, whoever did this to you
made one hell of a mistake,

57
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:22,378
and, you and me,
we're gonna make him pay for it.

58
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,984
So, uh, why don't you tell me
what happened?

59
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:33,861
I was pulling out real slow
and, out of nowhere,

60
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:38,801
his Jaguar comes
racing around the corner
like a bat out of hell.

61
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,364
They took some bone
from my hip and put it
in my neck.

62
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:45,375
I don't have insurance,

63
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:49,709
so I'm about $ 17,000
in debt right now.

64
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:54,548
I couldn't take pain killers
'cause they made me too groggy
to take care of my kids.

65
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:57,679
Matthew's eight
and Katie's almost six...

66
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:00,816
and Beth's just nine months.

67
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:04,157
I just want to be a good mom,
a nice person,

68
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,322
a decent citizen.

69
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,593
I just want to take good care
of my kids, you know?

70
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,501
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.

71
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,336
Seventeen thousand in debt?
[Sighs]

72
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,936
Is your ex-husband
helping out?
Which one?

73
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:28,682
There's more than one?
Yeah, there's two.
Why?

74
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:37,791
So, you must have been feeling
pretty desperate that afternoon.

75
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,454
What's your point?

76
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,125
[Attorney]
Broke, three kids,
no job.

77
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,465
- A doctor in a Jaguar must have
looked like a good meal ticket.
- Objection.

78
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,232
[Judge]
Sustained.
What? He hit me.

79
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:51,401
- So you say.
- He came tearing around
the corner, out of control!

80
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:56,106
An E.R. Doctor,
who spends his day saving lives,
was the one out of control?

81
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:00,550
That asshole smashed in
my fucking neck.

82
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,144
[Spectators Murmuring]

83
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:05,280
Open and shut.
Open and fucking shut!

84
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,291
That is exactly
the kind of language
that lost the case.

85
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,726
It was over long before that.
I told you the questions
might get personal.

86
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,956
No, you told me
I'd be set!
I never said that.

87
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,124
You told me
I had a good shot.
I had no shot!

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,566
Let's try
and settle down here.
Fuck "settle down"!

89
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:21,231
I've got $ 74 in the bank.
I can't afford
to settle down.

90
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,307
I'm sorry, Erin.

91
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:27,103
Do they teach lawyers
to apologize?

92
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,441
Because you suck at it.

93
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,909
Hello? Hi.
Hi, Erin.

94
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:09,475
You've come so soon.
Yeah.

95
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:12,454
Oh, were you
a good girl, huh?

96
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:14,821
You're my little baby.
[Coughs]

97
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:17,622
What is that,
a little cough?
She's got a little cough.

98
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:21,357
I sat in the steam with her
to try to loosen it up, but...

99
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:24,696
I think I've got
some cough medicine.
Ah, bueno.

100
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:29,034
Um, listen... I didn't want
to tell you before,
Yeah?

101
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:31,336
You know,
with your worries.
What?

102
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:35,139
My daughter
bought a big house
with a room for me.

103
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:37,146
I'm moving in with her.

104
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:39,148
When?
Next week.

105
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:42,413
Next week?
I know,
but it's good for me.

106
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:46,690
Now I can help my daughter
take care of my grandkids.
And it's good for you too.

107
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:49,849
Now you have money,
you can hire a good baby-sitter,
eh?

108
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:52,292
Not the old lady
next door.

109
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:54,296
Thanks.

110

Matthew?

111
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:02,166
Katie, you back here?
[Katie]
Yeah.

112
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:04,172
Okay, come on in,
would you?

Hey, get in the house.
No dripping.

115
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:13,406

Okay.

116
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:20,415

don't get sick on me. Please.

Matthew! Katie!
We're going out.

127
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,894
You kids go ahead
and order.

128
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,996
Okay, I'm gonna have
a cheeseburger deluxe
with a Coke.

129
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:12,166
Okay.

130
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:15,075
Mommy, can I have
a cheeseburger deluxe...

131
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,272
with no cheese
and no bread?

132
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:20,316
- Did you get that?
- Yes.

133
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:25,116
And she will have
a cup of chicken broth
and a few crackers, please.

134
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:29,352
And for you?
Okay.
Just a cup of coffee.

135
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:33,522
Mommy, you're not eating?
Well, my lawyer took me out
to a fancy lunch to celebrate,

136
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,531
and I'm still stuffed.

137
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,533
How about that?

[Beth Crying]

I'm calling about the job ad
in the paper.

141
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,477
Yes, I'm calling
about the job ad.

142
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:26,345
Great personality, good voice.

143

I don't have any actual
sales experience.

I don't really have a resume,
but I can...

145
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:34,656
No, I don't have
any computer skills, but...

146
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:39,684
Oh. Well, I thought
it was the local store.

Okay. Thanks anyway.

No, but I've called

B-r-o-c-k-o-v-i-c-h.

155
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:08,184
I'm a client.
I want him to call me.
It's as simple as that.

156
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,327
Okay.
[Sighs]

157
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:30,977
[Gasps]
Goddamn it!

158
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:34,414
Brenda!
Brenda!
Yeah?

159
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:38,511
Who put that there?
Those are the files
you asked for.

160
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,886
I didn't ask for you
to put it in the middle
of the floor.

161
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,925
I mean, look at me.
Get a towel, will ya?

162
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,927
Hey. Hey.

163
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:49,957
What's she doing here?
Who?

164
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:56,664
Donald.

165
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,540
What's she doing here?
She works here.

166
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:16,884
Erin, how's it going?

167
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,428
You never
called me back.
I left messages.

168
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:21,521
You did?
Well, I didn't know that.

169
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:26,501
Donald seems to think you...
There's two things that
aggravate me, Mr. Masry:

170
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,935
Being ignored
and being lied to.

171
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,439
I never lied.
You told me
things would be fine.

172
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:33,442
They're not.
I trusted you.

173
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,809
I'm sorry about that.
I am.
I don't need pity.
I need a paycheck.

174
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,281
I've looked, but when
you've spent the past
six years raising babies,

175
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,944
it's real hard to convince
someone to give you a job
that pays worth a damn.

176
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,115
Are you getting every word
of this, honey, or am I
talking too fast for you?

177
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,124
[Ed]
I'm sorry
about that.

178
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,956
I really am, but we have
a full staff right now...
Bullshit!

179
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:55,327
If you had a full staff,
this office would return
a client's damn phone call.

180
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:59,459
I'm smart,
I'm hard-working,
and I'll do anything,

181
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:01,470
and I'm not leaving here
without a job.

182
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:17,008
[Softly]
Don't make me beg.

183
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,818
If it doesn't work out,
fire me.

184
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,824
Don't make me beg.

185
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,594
No benefits.

186
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,636
What we do in here
is file all the cases.

187
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:41,234
That way, at any time,
we can tell the status
of a file.

188
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:44,007
You know,
where it is in the office,
stuff like that.

189
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,777
Here's where we
organize all the files
alphabetically.

190
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:52,117
Simple enough.
Okay.
Here's your desk.

191
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,816
Come with me.
I want to show you
where the Xerox machine is.

192
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:57,451
Everybody has a code,
and you need to know about that.

193
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,961
Do I get to pick
my own code?
We'll see.

194
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:05,426
[Erin]
Mr. Masry?
Yeah?

195
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,562
I was wondering,
can you tell me who I talk to...

196
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:11,801
about maybe getting
an advance on my paycheck,
just for the weekend?

197
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:17,370
Rosalind's the office manager.
She handles the payroll
and petty cash.

198
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:23,142
But she's gone already.
She leaves early on Fridays.

199
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,723
Okay. Thank you.
Oh, for Pete's sake,
here, here.

200
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:35,063
I've only got hundreds.

201
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,526
Here.
[Clears Throat]

202
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:42,798
I don't want your money,
Mr. Masry.

203
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:46,740
Where do you think
your paycheck comes from?
Here.

204
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,608
Have a good weekend.
Thank you.

205
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,080
See you.
[Employees]
See you. Good night.

206
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,083
[Ed]
See you Monday.

207
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:10,159
Hey. Hi, my sweetie.
Hello. [Kisses]

208
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,168
How are you?
Matthew? Katie?

209
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:17,104
Hey, Mom.
Hi, sweetie.
Come on.

210
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:19,437
How are you?
Thanks a lot.

211
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,844
You're welcome.

212
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,740

Hey!
Hello.

220
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,552
What are you doing
making all that goddamn noise?

221
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,560
Well, uh, I don't know.

222
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:14,562
We were just
introducing ourselves
to the neighborhood, I guess.

223
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,258
Well, I'm the neighbors.

224
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:20,062
There, we're introduced,
so shut the fuck up.

225
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:22,831
[Chuckling]
Hey, hey.

226
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:26,341
Hold on there.
Let's start over,
okay?

227
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:28,342
My name's George.
What's yours?

228
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,177
Just think of me as the person
next door who likes it quiet.

229
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:35,182
Hey, come on.
Don't be like that.

230
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,445
Hell, we live next door
to each other.
I feel bad.

231
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,454
I feel terrible. I'm sorry.
Will you accept my apology?

232
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:43,787
I mean, hell, we're living
right next door to each other.
If you need a cup of sugar...

233
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,851
I don't eat sugar.
You don't need
any sugar?

234
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:49,955
Why don't I take you
out to dinner to apologize
for my rudeness?

235
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:54,628
You give me your number.
I already got your address,
so you can't get away.

236
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:57,604
Huh? I'll call you up proper,
and I'll ask you out
and everything.

237
00:17:57,673 --> 00:18:00,437
[Scoffs]
You want my number?

238
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,807
I do.
I do want your number.

239
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:07,214
Which number do you want,
George?

240
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:10,149
Now I like the way
you say "George."

241
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:12,152
How many numbers you got?

242
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,883
Oh, I got numbers coming out
of my ears. For instance, ten.

243
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,325
"Ten"?
Yeah. That's how many
months old my baby girl is.

244
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:24,094
You got a little girl?
Yeah. Sexy, huh?

245
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,100
How about this
for a number: Six?

246
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:29,103
That's how old
my other daughter is.
Eight is the age of my son.

247
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:31,969
Two is how many times
I've been married and divorced.

248
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,406
Sixteen is the number of dollars
I have in my bank account.

249
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:39,072
850-3943. That's my
phone number, and with all
the numbers I gave you...

250
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:42,446
I'm guessing zero is the number
of times you're gonna call it.

251
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:46,317
Hey, how do you remember
your bank balance off the top
of your head like that?

252
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:48,652
That impresses me.

253
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:50,851
You're dead wrong
about that zero thing,
baby.

How long has she been crying
like that?

256
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,966
She's got that tooth coming in.
Why don't you give her
a cold washcloth to suck on?

257
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,443
I gotta go.
There's a clean one in the bag.
I'll check back later.

258
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:14,539
- Where's Anna?
- She's out to lunch
with the girls.

259
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:18,712
Oh.
I have to open a file.

Real estate thing,
pro bono.
Okay.

261
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,527
You know how to do that,
don't you?
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

262
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:28,529
No problem.

263
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:35,494
- You're a girl.
- Excuse me?

264
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,301
Why aren't you out to lunch
with the girls?
You're a girl.

265
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,575
I guess I'm not the right kind.

266
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:47,247
Oh.

267
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:51,880
Uh, look, now, you may want...

268
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:55,889
Now that you're working here,
you may want to, uh...

269
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:57,982
rethink your wardrobe a little.

270
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,551
Why is that?

271
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:03,894
Well, I think
some of the girls...

272
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:06,490
are a little uncomfortable...

273
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:08,763
because of what you wear.

274
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:12,673
Is that so?

275
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:16,677
Well, it just so happens,
I think I look nice.

276
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:19,646
And as long as I have one ass
instead of two,

277
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,308
I'll wear what I like,
if that's all right with you.

278
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:29,984
Uh-huh.

279
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:31,992
You might want
to rethink those ties.

[Erin]
Anna?

281
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:50,474
Huh?
This real estate stuff...
Could you remind me?

282
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:53,036
I'm a little confused
exactly how we do it.

283
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:57,677
Why are there medical
records and blood samples
in real estate files?

284
00:20:57,752 --> 00:20:59,686
Erin, you've been here
long enough.

to do your job by now,

for you.

I just went to pick them up.

She came by about an hour ago
and said something came up and
she had to drop the kids off.

299
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:34,345
"Something came up"?
Why didn't she call me at work?

00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,680
I don't know.

Mom.

303
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:46,260
Sorry. I just can't believe
she dumps my kids off
when nobody's home.

304
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:49,263
I was home.
We're fine.

305
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:51,526
Seriously,
we cooked some burgers,
had some milk.

306
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,364
Want a hot dog?
There's an extra one
on the grill.

307
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:57,894
Or a cheeseburger.
With this mustard,
it's slippery.

308
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:02,743
[Matthew]
Mom, what do you think
about me getting a tattoo?

309
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:05,811
One, two, three.

310
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:09,872
[Chuckling]

311
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,009
[Matthew]
I got all these kings.
You win, you got a joker.

312
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:16,021
[Continues Putting Cards Down]
King. Joker.

313
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,354
You stole a joker!
[Laughing]

314
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,190
He cheats.
What do you mean,
I cheat?

315
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:24,856
You cheat!
[Laughing]

316
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:27,058
Get another one.

317
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:30,001
Time to go to bed.
[Children
Continue Playing]

318
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,470
Excuse me. Get ready for bed.
Brush your teeth.
[Matthew] Okay.

319
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:36,733
Play tomorrow?
Yeah.

320
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,613
Good night, buddy.
Good night.
[Both]
Good night.

321
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,445
- What's that?
- This is a Harley-Davidson.

322
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:46,452
It's the best damn motorcycle
ever made.

323
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,547
And if I ever catch
either one of you near one,
I'll knock you silly.

324
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,961
[Katie Hopping]

325
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:58,497
Brush your teeth,
and keep it down.
The baby's asleep.

326
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:01,159
[Sighs]
Yeah.
You have great kids.

327
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:05,136
Well, I'm sure
I'll fuck them up eventually.

328
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:08,003
[Laughing]
Why?

329
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:10,565
I'm obviously not
a good judge of character...

330
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:13,340
or I would have never left them
with that idiot...

331
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:16,974
who cost a fortune
and smelled like chicken fat.

332
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,314
After I find her and kill her,

333
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:22,287
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

334
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:25,654
If you need help with them,
I could do that.

335
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,193
I'm not leaving my kids
with you.
[George]
Why?

336
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:30,195
I don't even know you.

337
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:33,562
What do you want
to know? Ask me.

338
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:36,568
Look, thanks for today.
You're welcome.
It was my pleasure.

339
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:41,140
How many decks
do you guys have here?

340
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:44,200
We had more than enough.
What's the matter?

341
00:24:44,277 --> 00:24:46,302
You got so many friends
in this world, you can't
use one more?

342
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:48,438
Huh? I'm serious.

343
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:50,449
If you need someone
to look after your kids...

344
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:52,451
after school
or whatever,

345
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,612
I don't have a job now,
so...

346
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:57,623
Oh, that's
a great recommendation.

347
00:24:57,691 --> 00:25:00,854
I'm unemployed.
By choice.

348
00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:02,861
I work when I need to.
Yeah?

349
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:06,626
What do you do
the rest of the time,
live off your trust fund?

350
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,000
No, I do construction,
which pays real good, and
I make it last by living cheap.

351
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:13,198
[Noise]
I hope that's not supposed
to impress me.

352
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:15,002
Hey, bed.

353
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:18,135
[Footsteps Departing, Rapidly]
[George]
Your little ghosts.

354
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:21,339
You always this hard
on people who try
to help you?

355
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:24,281
[Sorting Cards]
I'm out of practice.

356
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:26,979
Yeah, well, let me
remind you then.

357
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:31,251
The polite thing is
to say, "Thank you."
Let's start with that.

358
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:34,225
Then you could say,
"Hey, that's a really
nice offer.

359
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:36,785
I don't mind
taking you up on that."

360
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:40,663
Why the hell do you want
to watch my kids?
I like kids.

361
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:43,669
Yeah, I do. I like
hanging out with them.
They keep it simple.

362
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:48,006
You're home every afternoon?

363
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:50,269
I'm usually just working
on my bike.

364
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:56,741
Listen,
it's no big deal.
If it doesn't work out,

365
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,943
you can always
send them back
to the chicken fat lady.

366
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:08,125
This isn't gonna get you laid,
you know?
[Laughs]

367
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:10,094
[Snaps Fingers]
Get in bed.

368
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:14,031
[Footsteps Departing, Rapidly]
That's good, 'cause I don't
find you attractive either.

369
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,331
Good, then we're even.
Right, so we don't have
to worry about that.

370
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:20,032
I'm so glad we got that
out of the way.
I feel much better.

371
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:23,439
I do too. Seriously.
Because now I can just
look after the kids,

372
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,809
and I don't have to worry
about you coming on
to me all the time.

373
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:28,813
[Sorting Cards]

374

00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:14,993
[Cooing Continues]

377

[Ed Talking Softly]
Bring the phone
into the changing room.

378
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:31,735
Mrs. Masry,
don't be such a tease.

379
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:33,870
Hold on. Just hold on.
Yeah?

380
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:36,848
Sorry. Would you mind
if I investigate this
a little further?

381
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:41,046
- Investigate what?
- This real estate thing
with the Jensens.

382
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,646
- The pro bono case.
- Yeah, yeah.

383
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:46,351
Yeah? Because I just want
to make sure I'm understanding
what I'm reading.

384
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:49,953
Yeah, yeah, sure.
[Erin]
You don't mind?

385
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,555
Okay, great. Thanks.

388
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:03,736
Hi.
Donna Jensen?
Hi.

389
00:29:03,803 --> 00:29:07,899
Yes.
I'm Erin Brockovich,
with Masry & Vititoe.

390
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:10,067
Oh. You're a lawyer?

391
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:13,738
Hell, no.
I hate lawyers.
I just work for them.

392
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,781
[Chuckles]
Um, do you have
a minute?

393
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:19,080
I don't mean to be a pain
in PG&E's backside,

394
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:21,620
especially after all
they've done for Hinkley,

395
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:24,156
but I look around here
and I think,

396
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,954
"If they want this place,
they're gonna have to pay
for it."

397
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:29,324
So you didn't
put the house up
for sale,

398
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:33,229
they just came to you
and wanted to buy it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

399
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,597
I don't want to move.

400
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:38,967
Uproot the kids?
I've got a couple of girls.

401
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,530
Honest to God,
I don't know
if I have the energy.

402
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:45,203
You know,
I've been sick.

403
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,008
Me and Pete both have.

404
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:50,276
So, the whole idea
of selling this house,

405
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,148
if they're not
gonna pay us properly,
I just don't see the point.

406
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:56,382
Yeah, yeah,
I can see that.

407
00:29:56,456 --> 00:30:00,358
But...
I guess the only thing
that confused me is,

408
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:03,395
not that your medical
problems aren't important,

409
00:30:03,463 --> 00:30:08,264
but how come the files
on that are in with all
the real estate stuff?

410
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:13,328
Well, there's just
so much correspondence,
I just keep it all in one place.

411
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:16,000
Right. Right.

412
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:19,636
Um, I'm sorry,

413
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:23,375
I just don't see why
you're corresponding
with PG&E...

414
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:26,316
about your medical problems
in the first place.

415
00:30:26,386 --> 00:30:29,355
Well, they paid
for the doctor's visit.

416
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:31,356
They did?

417
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,825
You bet.
Paid for a checkup
for the whole family.

418
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:37,419
Not like with insurance
where you pay...

419
00:30:37,497 --> 00:30:40,295
and a year goes by
and maybe you see some money.

420
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:43,028
They just took care of it
just like that.
[Snaps Fingers]

421
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:46,697
We never even saw a bill.
Wow.
Why'd they do that?

422
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,536
Because of the chromium.

423
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,838
The what?
The chromium.

424
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,540
That's what kicked
this whole thing off.
[Sighs]

425

[Horn Blaring]

426
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:11,554
[Blaring Continues]

427
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:37,388
What kind of chromium
is it?
There's more than one type?

428
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:41,415
Yes, there's straight-up
chromium; does good things
for the body.

429
00:31:41,494 --> 00:31:44,054
There's chrom three,
which is fairly benign.

430
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,724
Then there's chrom six,
hexavalent chromium,

431
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,927
which, depending on the amounts,
can be very harmful.

432
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:52,869
Harmful how?
What would you get?

433
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:55,304
With repeated exposure
to toxic levels,

434
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,866
God, anything, really,
from chronic headaches
and nosebleeds...

435
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:01,310
to respiratory disease,
liver failure,

436
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,371
heart failure,
reproductive failure,

437
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:05,383
bone or organ deterioration,

438
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:07,817
plus, of course,
any type of cancer.

439
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:10,981
So, that stuff,
it kills people?

440
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:14,685
Yeah, definitely.
Highly toxic,
highly carcinogenic.

441
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,092
It gets into your DNA too,
so you pass the trouble
along to your kids.

442
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:19,097
It's very, very bad.

443
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:22,657
What's it used for?
A rust inhibitor.

444
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:25,795
See, the utility plants
use these piston engines
to compress the gas.

445
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,032
The engines get hot.
You've got to run water
through them.

446
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:30,200
Chromium's in the water
to prevent corrosion.

447
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:34,576
Well, how do I find out
what kind of chromium
they use in Hinkley?

448
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:36,581
Have you been
to their water board?

Maybe you look like someone
who has a lot of fun.
Oh.

597
00:43:57,828 --> 00:44:00,729
So, by that standard, I should
assume you never get laid?

598
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,860
I'm married.

599
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:08,928
Look, what is all this?

600
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:14,239
What's the story
on this cancer stuff?

601
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:18,213
You want to know?
You have to hire me back.
I got a ton of bills to pay.

602
00:44:19,984 --> 00:44:22,953
Fine. Fine.

603
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,480
So, Donna just put in
these new cabinets...
stained the wood and all...

604
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:29,583
when she gets a call
from somebody at PG&E...

605
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,594
saying there's a freeway
gonna be built...

606
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:34,495
and they want to buy her house
to put in an off-ramp
to the plant.

607
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:37,329
Meanwhile, the husband's sick
with Hodgkin's.

608
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,631
She's in and out of the hospital
with tumors,

609
00:44:39,703 --> 00:44:42,331
believing one thing
has nothing to do
with the other.

610
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:44,636
Because PG&E told her
about the chromium?

611
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:46,642
Get this.
They had a seminar.

612
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,076
They invited
about 200 residents
from the area,

613
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:51,080
had it at the plant
in this warehouse,

614
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:54,311
telling them all
about chromium three
and how good it is for you...

615
00:44:54,385 --> 00:44:56,649
when all the time
they're using chromium six.

616
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,124
[Beth Fussing]
T-T-That document
you found at the water board...

617
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:07,027
the one that says
about the bad chromium...

618
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:09,691
You didn't happen
to make a copy, did you?

619
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:13,601
Of course I did.
Could I have
a look at it?

620
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:17,869
I want a raise
and benefits,

621
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:19,876
including dental.

622
00:45:19,944 --> 00:45:22,572
[Sighs]
Erin, this isn't the way
I do business.

623
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:24,580
What way is that?
Extortion.

624
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:27,344
Oh.

625
00:45:27,418 --> 00:45:29,352
[Coos]

626
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,218
[Beth Laughs]
[Sighs]

627
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:34,951
Okay, a five percent raise.
We'll talk about benefits later.

628
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:40,930
Ten.
There are lots of other places
I could get work.

629
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:43,762
Ten percent raise
and benefits.

630
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:45,768
But that's it.
I'm drawing the line.

631
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:48,771
[Softly]
He's drawing the line.
[Coos]

632
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:01,048
This the only thing
you got?

633
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:04,315
So far, but that place
is a pigsty. I wouldn't
be surprised if there's more.

634
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:06,720
Yeah, I know how
those things are run.
They're a mess.

635
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,056
What makes you think
you can just walk
in there...

636
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:14,222
and find...
what we need?

637
00:46:14,298 --> 00:46:17,165
They're called boobs, Ed.

638
00:46:31,181 --> 00:46:35,140
[Scott]
Yes. She already is.

639
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:38,120
[Whirring]
I understand.

640
00:46:38,188 --> 00:46:41,351
Okay, I agree.
I'm going to.

641
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:44,724
Right now.
[Hangs Receiver Up]

642
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:52,602
[Erin, Softly]
We're almost done.
So...

643
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,763
how are we doing?

644
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:57,204
We're doing great.
You...
[Crying]

645
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:59,834
[Crying Continues]
Good.

646
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,810
You've got quite a lot
done already,

647
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:04,347
so, um...

648
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:08,649
I'm sorry, but we need to have
those records back now, okay?

649
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:10,243
No.

650
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:15,414
[Crying]
These papers are a matter
of public record,

651
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:19,929
and I'm not leaving
until they're copied.

[Whirring Continues,
Beth Fussing]
[Stammering]

654
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,307
Fax these
to this number,
okay?

655
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,371
All of'em?
All of'em!

656

[Plant Horn Blaring]

660
00:47:58,836 --> 00:48:02,203
[Blaring Continues]
[Donna]
An on-site monitoring well?

661
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:05,503
That means that...
It was right up on the PG&E
property over there.

662
00:48:05,576 --> 00:48:11,242
And you say that this stuff,
this... hexavalent chromium...

663
00:48:11,315 --> 00:48:13,283
[Sighs]
It's poisonous.

664
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,251
Yeah.

665
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,654
Well...

666
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:22,749
Erin...

667
00:48:22,826 --> 00:48:27,525
it's just got to be different
than what's in our water
'cause ours is okay.

668
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,532
The guys from PG&E told me.

669
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,866
They sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine.

670
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:37,770
I know, I know, but...

671
00:48:37,841 --> 00:48:40,139
the toxicologist that
I've been talking to...

672
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,337
he gave me a list
of problems...

673
00:48:42,412 --> 00:48:45,074
that can come
from hexavalent
chromium exposure.

674
00:48:45,149 --> 00:48:48,641
Everything you all have
is on that list.

675
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,654
No, no, no.

676
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:55,182
No, that's not what...

677
00:48:55,259 --> 00:48:57,693
That's not what
our doctor said.

678
00:48:57,761 --> 00:49:00,958
He said that...
[Sighs]

679
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,329
Well, that one's
got absolutely nothing
to do with the other.

680
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,062
Right.

681
00:49:06,136 --> 00:49:09,333
But PG&E paid
for that doctor.

682
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:12,908

Ashley! Shanna!
Get out of the pool!

00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:36,765
How come?
'Cause I said so,
that's why!

689
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:42,840
That's it.
Okay, okay, girls.

690
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:45,908
The minute Brenda
sent that fax,

691
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:50,106
I'm saying the second
she pressed the "send"
button,

692
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,707
PG&E's claim department...

693
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:57,686
was on the phone to me
scheduling a meeting.

694
00:49:57,754 --> 00:50:00,222
So you think that we...
Let me do it...

695
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,224
'cause you're
driving me nuts.
What?

696
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,226
So you think
we scared them,
don't you?

697
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:06,694
Well, they're
taking the trouble
to send someone.

698
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:10,130
Sure as hell sounds like
they're sitting up
and taking notice.

699
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,816
Mr. Foil?

700
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,420
In the interest of putting this
whole thing to rest,

701
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:36,016
PG&E is willing
to offer the Jensens
$250,000 for their home.

702
00:50:36,093 --> 00:50:38,084
[Scoffs]
Two hundred and fifty thousand?

703
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:41,824
In terms of land value
out in Hinkley,

704
00:50:41,899 --> 00:50:44,697
Mr. Masry, we feel that's
a more than fair price.

705
00:50:44,768 --> 00:50:47,635
How about in terms
of medical expenses?

706
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:49,729
Two hundred and fifty thousand
isn't gonna come close...

707
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:52,400
to what this family's gonna have
to spend on doctors.

708
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:57,203
I understand they've
had a bad run of luck
healthwise.

709
00:50:57,281 --> 00:51:00,739
They have my sympathies,
but that's not PG&E's fault.

710
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:02,682
You're kidding,
right?

711
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:06,445
Look at these readings.

712
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:10,516
PG&E's own technicians
documented...

713
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:13,062
toxic levels
of hexavalent chromium...

714
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,224
in those wells
on numerous occasions.

715
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,564
Everything
the Jensens
have had...

716
00:51:18,635 --> 00:51:21,832
is proven reaction
to exposure to hexavalent
chromium.

717
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:24,635
They have had...

718
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,676
They have had...

719
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:31,374
Breast cysts,
uterine cancer,

720
00:51:31,448 --> 00:51:33,643
Hodgkin's disease,
immune deficiencies,

721
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:37,813
asthma, chronic nosebleeds...
A million things could have
caused those problems.

722
00:51:37,888 --> 00:51:42,325
Poor diet, bad genes,
irresponsible lifestyle.

723
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,451
Our offer is final,
and it's more than fair.

724
00:51:44,528 --> 00:51:48,225
Wait a minute.
I thought we were
negotiating here.

725
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:55,399
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is all I'm authorized
to offer.

726
00:51:57,474 --> 00:52:00,068
I'll present your offer
to my clients.

727
00:52:00,143 --> 00:52:02,634
I doubt
they'll accept.
Mr. Masry...

728
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:06,348
before you go off
on some crusade,

729
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:09,146
you might want
to remember who it is
you're dealing with here.

730
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:12,848
PG&E's a $28-billion
corporation.

731
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:16,359
$28 billion!

732
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:18,792
I didn't know
it was that much!

733
00:52:18,862 --> 00:52:22,821
Wow! 28 billion!

734
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:25,595
[Sighs]
Holy cow!

735
00:52:25,669 --> 00:52:27,933
At least
they made an offer.
That wasn't an offer.

736
00:52:28,005 --> 00:52:30,997
A million would have
been an offer.

737
00:52:31,074 --> 00:52:33,634
They sent a mail clerk down
to jerk me off, waste my time!

738
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,009
- Why would they do that?
- Because they can.

739
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,777
You heard what that kid said.
They have $28 billion
at their disposal!

740
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:43,342
- They can afford to waste
all the time in the world.
- And you can't?

741
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,945
- You think I'm made of money?
- What are you yelling
at me for?

742
00:52:46,023 --> 00:52:47,820
- Because I'm pissed off!
- Good!

743
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:51,190
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you back!

744
00:52:52,562 --> 00:52:56,760

I really hate you sometimes,
you know that?

00:53:03,373 --> 00:53:05,864
Ah, you love me.

[Footsteps Continue]

751
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:20,279
You've been reading
for hours.

752
00:53:20,357 --> 00:53:22,757
I'm a slow reader.

755

[Man]
Uh, Erin Brockovich?

756
00:53:44,381 --> 00:53:47,976
That's probably her
at that desk.

757
00:53:51,221 --> 00:53:53,155
Excuse me.

758
00:53:53,223 --> 00:53:56,192
Are you
Erin Brockovich?
Yeah.

759
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,356
Uh, I'm Tom... Robinson.
This is my wife Mandy.

760
00:54:00,431 --> 00:54:04,060
Hi.
[Tom]
We used to live across
the street from the Jensens.

761
00:54:04,134 --> 00:54:06,659
I think you know Donna.
[Erin]
Yeah.

762
00:54:06,737 --> 00:54:10,867
Uh, PG&E bought our house
last year.

763
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:15,503
[Tom]
The vets said they had
a bunch of tumors and stuff...

764
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:20,209
and, you can see,
they couldn't really walk.

765
00:54:20,284 --> 00:54:22,343
How many were born
like this?

766
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:27,015
Uh, 12 or 13
or so.
Yeah.

767
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:31,187
When Donna told us about you
and what you told her
about the chromium,

768
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:34,287
we figured
that might have something
to do with this too.

769
00:54:34,364 --> 00:54:38,460
Yeah, it might.
May I keep these?
Yes.

770
00:54:38,535 --> 00:54:41,868
Okay. Great.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

771
00:54:41,939 --> 00:54:45,670
Um...
There's something else too.

772
00:54:47,377 --> 00:54:51,245
What?
Um... this, uh...

773
00:54:51,315 --> 00:54:55,911
Um... well, uh...
Mandy here has had...

774
00:54:55,986 --> 00:54:57,920
five miscarriages.

775
00:54:57,988 --> 00:55:00,752
I'm so sorry.

776
00:55:00,824 --> 00:55:04,658
I figured it was
something I did...

777
00:55:04,728 --> 00:55:07,663
like when I smoked
marijuana maybe...

778
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:10,325
or took
birth control pills.

779
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,168
But then Donna said
you thought chromium might be
to blame for her problems.

780
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,504
So I figured...

781
00:55:21,411 --> 00:55:23,345
maybe it wasn't just me.

782
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:34,447
[Sighs]
Whoa.

783
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:36,959
[Kissing]

784
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,764
I have
to take a bath.

785
00:55:41,832 --> 00:55:45,791
You should go in.

786
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:48,133
They're not asleep?

787
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:51,640
[Sighs]

788
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,972
Beth and Katie are.

789
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:02,481
Hey.

790
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:10,860
How was school?

791
00:56:10,928 --> 00:56:12,987
Fine.

792
00:56:13,063 --> 00:56:15,725
Did you do
your homework?
Yeah.

793
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:19,335
Any problems?

794
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:34,608
I know you're upset,
but... the way this job is,

795
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:37,279
things come up
at the last minute;

796
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:39,447
real important things
that I gotta deal with.

797
00:56:39,523 --> 00:56:41,457
Fine!

798
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,966
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm doing this for us.

799
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:54,970
I know it's hard for you
to understand, but...

800
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,906
Don't you want Mommy
to be good at her job?

801
00:56:58,976 --> 00:57:01,809
Hmm?

802
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:10,008
It's not like
I miss dinner all the time.
We all ate together last night.

803
00:57:10,087 --> 00:57:12,885
You were reading
the whole time.

804
00:57:18,562 --> 00:57:20,496
Okay.

805
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,596
[Honking Horn]

806
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:38,839
[Man]
You know, there's something
about this whole thing...

807
00:57:38,915 --> 00:57:41,406
I don't quite understand,
Mr. Masry.

808
00:57:41,484 --> 00:57:44,112
If PG&E messed
with our water,

809
00:57:44,187 --> 00:57:47,714
why would they bother
saying anything about it
to us at all?

810
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,849
Why not just
keep quiet about it?

811
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:52,292
To establish
a statute of limitations.

812
00:57:52,362 --> 00:57:54,956
In a case like this,
you only have one year...

813
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:58,558
from the time you first learn
about the problem to file suit.

814
00:57:58,635 --> 00:58:01,035
So PG&E figures...

815
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:05,234
we'll let the cat out
of the bag, tell the people
the water's not perfect,

816
00:58:05,308 --> 00:58:08,300
and if we can ride out the year
with no one suing,

817
00:58:08,378 --> 00:58:10,573
we'll be in the clear forever.

818
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:13,081
But it was more than a year ago
that they told us.

819
00:58:13,149 --> 00:58:16,312
It's okay.
We're not suing.
Not yet.

820
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:19,287
All we're doing is using
this information...

821
00:58:19,355 --> 00:58:23,416
to get you a real nice
purchase price
on your house...

822
00:58:23,493 --> 00:58:27,293
and, you two,
a comparable retroactive bonus
on your sale price.

823
00:58:27,363 --> 00:58:30,298
That way,
PG&E can still look good
to their shareholders...

824
00:58:30,366 --> 00:58:32,334
because they're not involved
in an ugly lawsuit.

825
00:58:32,402 --> 00:58:34,768
All they're doing
is buying a little property.

826
00:58:34,837 --> 00:58:39,740
It... doesn't say here
how much this thing
is gonna cost us.

827
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:43,836
My fee is 40% of whatever
you get awarded.

828
00:58:52,922 --> 00:58:55,948
Boy, do I know
how you feel.

829
00:58:56,025 --> 00:59:00,621
The first time
I heard that number, I said,
"You've got to be kidding me.

830
00:59:00,697 --> 00:59:04,531
Forty goddamn percent?
I'm the one that's injured."
Erin...

831
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,798
"This joker sits at a desk,
and he wants to walk away
with almost half my reward?"

832
00:59:08,871 --> 00:59:10,998
Erin, can l...
But then...

833
00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:13,634
I asked him...

834
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,474
what he makes
if I don't get anything.

835
00:59:16,546 --> 00:59:19,982
Then I don't
get anything either.

836
00:59:20,049 --> 00:59:22,381
[Erin]
Plus he's out
all the costs.

837
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:26,889
So I realized...
he's taking a chance too.

838
00:59:35,565 --> 00:59:38,125
You got a pen, honey?

839
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:44,639
Well, all right then.

840
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:49,602
Oh, I made a bundt cake.

841
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:51,647
Let me put on some coffee.
Who would like coffee and cake?

842
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:54,877
I do.
Thanks, but we have
to be getting back.

843
00:59:56,152 --> 00:59:58,620
[Whispers]
Have a fucking
cup of coffee, Ed.

844
00:59:58,688 --> 01:00:01,156
Coffee will be great.
Thank you.

845
01:00:01,224 --> 01:00:03,158
[Donna]
All right.
I'll help you.

846
01:00:07,697 --> 01:00:10,632
My wife makes
really good bundt cake.

847
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,803
I love bundt cake.

848
01:00:13,936 --> 01:00:15,961
[Water Hose Running]

849
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:20,600
[Bob Linwood] Seems like
everybody in the family
ended up with a rash somehow.

850
01:00:20,676 --> 01:00:24,840
It also seemed like no matter
what we did for it,
it always came back.

851
01:00:24,914 --> 01:00:27,815
Over what kind
of period of time?

852
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:30,477
Oh... a long time.
You know, years.

853
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:35,081
Never did keep track of it.
Kids are sick.
Animals need to be fed.

854
01:00:35,157 --> 01:00:37,182
Just couldn't
get rid of it.
That's all.

855
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:40,786
[Erin]
Well, Mrs. De Soto said...

856
01:00:40,863 --> 01:00:44,094
that she wasn't
exactly sure what you had.

857
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:46,760
We know what it is.
It's gastro...

858
01:00:46,836 --> 01:00:49,066
Gastrointestinal cancer.
Cancer. Yeah.

859
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:52,437
She got sick about...
nine months ago.
[Laura Ambrosino] Nine months ago.

860
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:54,772
[Mike Ambrosino]
They operated on her
about six months ago.

861
01:00:54,844 --> 01:00:57,278
[Laura Ambrosino]
Mm-hmm. The intestine.
Right.

862
01:01:07,189 --> 01:01:11,592
Hi, I'm Erin...
I know who you are.
Donna called me.

863
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,652
Oh.
Can I come in?

864
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:18,496
I told Donna
we're not interested
in getting involved.

865
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:21,569
Can I ask why?

866
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:24,629
What's the point?

867
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:29,939
Well, Donna told me
that you've been sick...

868
01:01:30,012 --> 01:01:33,641
and that your kids
were sick...
You people don't give a shit.

869
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:36,241
Anything to get what you want.

870
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:47,629
[Erin]
It's good of you to have me in
when I just stopped by.

871
01:01:47,696 --> 01:01:49,755
She's feeling
pretty good today.
She's doing well.

872
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:54,667
Mike Ambrosino remembered he had
seen you folks at the hospital
from time to time.

873
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:56,671
That's what
brought me out here.

874
01:01:56,739 --> 01:01:59,435
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
Yeah.

875
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:02,136
We've been there
from time to time.
Yeah.

876
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:06,204
And you... Wooftie.
Aren't you a beauty?
[Rita Daniels Laughs]

877
01:02:06,282 --> 01:02:08,944
You drive all
the boys crazy,
don't you?

878
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:12,385
[Chuckling]
I can see it in your eyes.
You drive them wild.

879
01:02:12,454 --> 01:02:14,285
You do, don't you?

880
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:18,122
You torture them.
It's good for them.

881
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:22,061
Don't teach her anything
too early.
[Laughs]
Yeah.

882
01:02:22,131 --> 01:02:25,623
She can't wait
to get on her new dress.
Isn't that right?

883
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:29,034
[Ted Daniels]
She wants to go back to school.
We're trying to do that...

884
01:02:29,104 --> 01:02:32,972
in the next couple months.
Yeah, get her out
of her nightgown.

885
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:37,911
[Ted Daniels]
She's gonna do it.
She's gonna do it.

886
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:58,594
Absolutely not.
That's crazy.
Why not?

887
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:01,761
Because I said no.
The only reason PG&E's
even talking to us...

888
01:03:01,837 --> 01:03:04,601
is because
this is a quiet, little
real estate dispute.

889
01:03:04,673 --> 01:03:08,439
We add plaintiffs,
suddenly we're in the middle
or a toxic tort...

890
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:11,445
with a statute problem
against a massive utility.

891
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:13,674
No, thank you.
Okay.

892
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,274
So I'll go
to Ted and Rita Daniels...

893
01:03:16,352 --> 01:03:18,616
two of the nicest people
you could ever hope to meet...

894
01:03:18,687 --> 01:03:21,952
who every single day watch
their little girl, Annabelle,
fight like a dog against cancer,

895
01:03:22,024 --> 01:03:25,289
and I'll tell them
we can't help them because...

896
01:03:25,361 --> 01:03:27,295
you just don't want
to work that hard.

897
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:32,858
Work hard?
Let me tell you something.
I've worked all my life.

898
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:35,165
I've built a firm
and managed to keep it alive...

899
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:37,364
through lawsuits,
injunctions and evictions.

900
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:40,465
I've survived
a quadruple bypass, cancer,

901
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:43,306
being born with one kidney
and having diabetes.

902
01:03:43,379 --> 01:03:46,473
I've personally managed
to save a million dollars...

903
01:03:46,548 --> 01:03:49,210
over 30 years of getting
some clients ten times that.

904
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,479
Don't tell me
I don't work hard.

905
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:55,319
Don't tell me I haven't
earned the right to stop,
take a breath and enjoy life.

906
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,087
And what the hell do you know
about any of this anyway?

907
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,493
Something like this, Erin...
It could take forever.

908
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,497
They're a huge corporation.

909
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:06,159
They could bury us in paperwork
for the next 15 years.

910
01:04:06,235 --> 01:04:08,465
I'm just a guy
with a small, private firm!

911
01:04:08,537 --> 01:04:12,769
Who happens to know
they poisoned people
and lied about it.

912
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:14,832
We can get these people.

913
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:19,176
With a little effort,
I really think we can just
nail their asses to the wall.

914
01:04:19,248 --> 01:04:21,512
You do? With all
your legal expertise,
you believe that?

915
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:24,518
Don't you ever just know?
You also "just know" where
the money's coming from?

916
01:04:24,586 --> 01:04:26,520
That's why most
of these cases settle:
Lack of money.

917
01:04:26,588 --> 01:04:29,682
Do you know
what toxicologists
and geology experts cost?

918
01:04:29,758 --> 01:04:32,022
We're looking
at 100 grand a month, easy.

919
01:04:32,094 --> 01:04:35,461
I've already made
a huge dent in my savings.
We'll figure it out.

920
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:39,627
I don't know shit about shit,
but I know the difference
between right and wrong!

925
01:04:59,054 --> 01:05:03,286
Four more.
Eleven people so far.
You mean there's more?

926
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,485
I found one document
at the Water Board...

927
01:05:05,561 --> 01:05:08,826
that was a toxic test well
reading from 1967.

you find all the evidence
to back this up,

934

I'll take it on.

I'm filing for bankruptcy.

938
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:46,293
Of course,
gathering evidence is a big job.

939

A hell of a lot bigger
than just filing.

940

taking on more responsibility.
I don't believe this.

941
01:05:54,643 --> 01:05:58,477

And I'm gonna be spending
a lot of time in my car,

942
01:05:58,547 --> 01:06:02,210

You get everything done?

1042
01:13:13,012 --> 01:13:14,946
We got a lot of work done.

1043
01:13:15,014 --> 01:13:17,107
Sweetie.
I think I ate
three watermelons.

Let's go, brother.
Get on.

1045
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:23,455
Be careful.
[Woman]
Erin?
Get on me now.

1046
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:27,289
Erin, excuse me.
This is Nelson Perez.
Oh, hi.

1047
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,295
He works
at the compressor station.
Hi, nice to meet you.

1048
01:13:30,363 --> 01:13:34,129
PG&E.
Oh, hi.
Wow. Uh...

1049
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,964
I've come
at a bad time?
No, no, no.

1050
01:13:37,036 --> 01:13:39,061
Can you just
give me one...

1051
01:13:39,139 --> 01:13:42,302
Of course. Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.

1052
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:45,970
Oh, my God.
Uh... you know what?

1053
01:13:46,045 --> 01:13:49,037
Why don't you guys
go ahead without me,

1054
01:13:49,115 --> 01:13:51,049
[Scoffs]
And I will
get a ride with Ed.

1055
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:53,813
No, Mom.
No, sweetie, I'll be
right behind you.

1056
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:55,980
I'll be right behind you,
all right? Okay?

1057
01:13:56,055 --> 01:14:00,321
I really...
This is so...
Fine. Go, go, go, go.

1058
01:14:00,393 --> 01:14:02,987
I'll see you tonight, okay?
Okay?

1059
01:14:04,397 --> 01:14:07,662
Get down, bud.
[Sighs]

1060
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:11,898
Hey, you all right?
Hang on tight there.

1061
01:14:11,971 --> 01:14:14,906
Help your sister
with her shoes.
Come on, let's go.

[Motorcycle Engines Roaring]

1063
01:14:30,857 --> 01:14:34,452
Mr. Perez, this is so helpful.
Is it okay if I write some
of this down?

1064
01:14:34,527 --> 01:14:36,961
Sure, sure.
I have so many questions.
I want to know...

1065
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:40,431
how the plant works,
the cooling towers,
just everything, so...

1066
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:44,227
They use the hexachrome here,
in these cooling towers,

1067
01:14:44,304 --> 01:14:46,465
as an anticorrosive.

1068
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:49,474
Then they dump
the excess water
into these ponds.

1069
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:52,306
I don't remember seeing
any ponds out there.

1070
01:14:52,378 --> 01:14:55,814
This is an old picture.
They've been covered over,
and not too carefully.

1071
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:58,316
If you dig one inch
under the surface,

1072
01:14:58,384 --> 01:15:00,818
dirt's as green
as a fucking shamrock.

1073
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:03,481
That's what caused
the contamination?

1074
01:15:03,556 --> 01:15:07,652
Well, it didn't help,
but, no, the problem
actually started on the bottom.

1075
01:15:07,727 --> 01:15:09,991
According to...

1076
01:15:11,564 --> 01:15:13,498
this...

1077
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:16,160
in most cases, you
would line these ponds...

1078
01:15:16,236 --> 01:15:18,830
so this shit didn't
seep into the ground.

1079
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:21,897
But guess what?
They skipped that step?

1080
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,170
Mm-hmm.
Here are the ponds.

1081
01:15:24,244 --> 01:15:28,180
The plume comes down like this,
and Hinkley is down here.

1082
01:15:28,248 --> 01:15:32,150
It's like 14 years
of hexachrome just flowing
into the groundwater.

1083
01:15:32,218 --> 01:15:34,277
Jesus.

1084
01:15:34,354 --> 01:15:37,790
And this guy just offered
all this information?

1085
01:15:37,857 --> 01:15:41,452
Yeah. Nelson cares
what's in those ponds.

1086
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:43,995
He used to spend half the day
wading around in them.

1087
01:15:44,063 --> 01:15:46,623
That was his job.
Shit.

1088
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:54,864
What's the matter?

1089
01:15:54,941 --> 01:16:00,641
I don't know
if we can pull this off.

1090
01:16:00,713 --> 01:16:04,979
This is a monster case.
We're up to 411 plaintiffs.

1091
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:09,647
We've taken
162 declarations.

1092
01:16:09,722 --> 01:16:13,488
Probably hundreds more
out there have moved away.

1093
01:16:13,559 --> 01:16:16,323
We'll have to find them.
It's taking time, manpower.

1094
01:16:16,396 --> 01:16:18,489
Money's going out.
Nothing's coming in.

1095
01:16:18,564 --> 01:16:20,498
I'll have to take
a second mortgage
on the house.

1096
01:16:20,566 --> 01:16:22,830
So?
"So?"

1097
01:16:22,902 --> 01:16:27,999
So... I have to tell you.

1098
01:16:28,074 --> 01:16:32,568
I've been making inquiries
with other firms,

1099
01:16:32,645 --> 01:16:36,445
bigger firms,
to share some of the cost.

1100
01:16:36,516 --> 01:16:39,451
They all said,
"No, we don't have it."

1101
01:16:40,687 --> 01:16:42,882
That's bullshit.
We've got PG&E by the balls.

1102
01:16:42,956 --> 01:16:45,447
PG&E Hinkley by the balls,
but nobody's going
to get rich...

1103
01:16:45,525 --> 01:16:48,323
unless we can pin this
on PG&E corporate
in San Francisco.

1104
01:16:48,394 --> 01:16:50,794
What do you mean?
PG&E corporate
is claiming...

1105
01:16:50,863 --> 01:16:52,956
they had no way of knowing
what was going on
in Hinkley.

1106
01:16:53,032 --> 01:16:57,230
- Oh, they knew.
- Show me the document
that proves it.

1107
01:16:59,505 --> 01:17:04,465
Then they didn't know.
If they didn't know, we can't
hit them with punitive damages.

1108
01:17:04,544 --> 01:17:06,808
With punitive damages, we're
talking about a sum of money...

1109
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:09,439
that can actually
have some effect...

1110
01:17:09,515 --> 01:17:12,814
on these
people's lives.

1111
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:14,910
So what do we do now?

1112
01:17:19,225 --> 01:17:23,821
Let's assume there are documents
connecting PG&E Hinkley
with PG&E corporate,

1113
01:17:23,896 --> 01:17:25,921
and they know
these documents exist.

1114
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:30,959
We take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything you've dug up,

1115
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:33,505
we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction,

1116
01:17:33,573 --> 01:17:37,873
to see if they offer
a reasonable settlement
or just throw more paper at us.

1117
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:41,380
That sounds great.
Let's do that.
There's a downside.

1118
01:17:41,447 --> 01:17:44,780
PG&E will submit a demurrer,

1119
01:17:44,851 --> 01:17:47,615
a list of reasons
attacking each complaint,

1120
01:17:47,687 --> 01:17:50,781
claiming that each
cause of action has no merit.

1121
01:17:50,857 --> 01:17:54,452
If the judge agrees with them,
he'll dismiss our case.

1122
01:17:54,527 --> 01:17:56,654
PG&E will have
no reason to settle,

1123
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:59,789
and it's all over.

1124
01:18:04,037 --> 01:18:07,632
[Scoffs]
So, basically,
it all comes down...

1125
01:18:07,707 --> 01:18:10,972
to what this
one judge decides.

1126
01:18:11,044 --> 01:18:13,740
Basically, yeah.

1127
01:18:13,813 --> 01:18:16,145

to having them
come up benign...

1130
01:19:03,862 --> 01:19:08,629
I guess I just
didn't expect it.

1131
01:19:08,701 --> 01:19:13,468
[Sighs]
I wish I had longer
to get used to the idea.

1132
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:21,809
You think
if you got no uterus
and no breasts...

1133
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,077
you're still
technically a woman?

1134
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,812
Sure, you are.

1135
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:33,483
Yeah, you're just...
You're actually
a happier woman...

1136
01:19:33,559 --> 01:19:36,892
because you don't have
to worry about maxi pads
and underwire.

[Sighing]

1142
01:20:06,025 --> 01:20:08,926
[Judge]
All right, I have before me...

1143
01:20:08,994 --> 01:20:11,861
a complaint
on behalf of the residents
of Hinkley, California,

1144
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,422
who have filed this lawsuit
against Pacific Gas
and Electric...

1145
01:20:15,501 --> 01:20:19,437
for damages, medical expenses
and personal trauma...

1146
01:20:19,505 --> 01:20:21,803
due to contamination
of the groundwater...

1147
01:20:21,874 --> 01:20:24,365
in their area
by the defendant.

1148
01:20:24,443 --> 01:20:27,435
And I have here
84 motions to strike...

1149
01:20:27,513 --> 01:20:30,812
and demurrers
submitted by representatives
of Pacific Gas and Electric,

1150
01:20:30,883 --> 01:20:35,911
each attacking the validity
of this complaint.

1151
01:20:35,988 --> 01:20:40,118
I have reviewed
all of the information
carefully.

1152
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,626
I'm ready to give my decision.

1153
01:20:42,695 --> 01:20:45,926
Before I do, is there anything
anyone wants to say?

1154
01:20:45,998 --> 01:20:49,593
- No, Your Honor.
- No, Your Honor.

1155
01:20:49,668 --> 01:20:51,932
Very well.

1156
01:20:52,004 --> 01:20:54,097
In the matter of the plaintiffs
of Hinkley, California,

1157
01:20:54,173 --> 01:20:58,109
versus Pacific Gas and Electric,
it is the order of this court...

1158
01:20:58,177 --> 01:21:03,945
that each of the 84 motions
to strike and demurrers
are denied...

1159
01:21:04,016 --> 01:21:09,318
and the causes of action
against Pacific Gas and Electric
are upheld.

1160
01:21:09,388 --> 01:21:11,686
On a more personal note,

1161
01:21:11,757 --> 01:21:16,285
as a resident here in Barstow,
which is not far from Hinkley,

1162
01:21:16,362 --> 01:21:20,458
I am disturbed
by reference to evidence...

1163
01:21:20,532 --> 01:21:24,127
that suggests that not only
was hexavalent chromium used...

1164
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:27,798
but that your clients
actually sent these residents...

pamphlets telling them
that it was good for them.

1166

Tell your clients
they're going to trial.

for a minute.

Counselors.
Counselors.

1173
01:22:20,526 --> 01:22:22,517
Let's be honest here.

1174
01:22:22,594 --> 01:22:26,553
$20 million is more money
than these people
have ever dreamed of.

1175
01:22:26,632 --> 01:22:29,601
See, now that
pisses me off.

1176
01:22:29,668 --> 01:22:33,798
First of all,
since the demurrer, we have
more than 400 plaintiffs,

1177
01:22:33,872 --> 01:22:36,864
and, let's be honest,
we all know there
are more out there.

1178
01:22:36,942 --> 01:22:40,343
They may not be
the most sophisticated people,
but they do know how to divide.

1179
01:22:40,412 --> 01:22:42,778
$20 million isn't shit
when you split it between them.

1180
01:22:42,848 --> 01:22:44,748
Erin...
[Erin]
Second of all,

1181
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:46,910
these people don't dream
about being rich.

1182
01:22:46,985 --> 01:22:50,421
They dream about being able
to watch their kids
swim in a pool...

1183
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:53,788
without worrying they'll
have to have a hysterectomy
at the age of 20...

1184
01:22:53,859 --> 01:22:55,793
like Rosa Diaz,
a client of ours.

1185
01:22:55,861 --> 01:23:00,696
Or have their spine
deteriorate like Stan Bloom,

that many all at once.

1334
01:34:53,044 --> 01:34:56,810
So we need to get them
together in groups
of 20 or 30;

1335
01:34:56,881 --> 01:35:00,180
worst cases, the most
life-threatened, the sickest
in the first group.

1336
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:02,185
And so on
and so on.

1337
01:35:02,253 --> 01:35:05,620
Each one gets a go
before the judge
to determine damages.

1338
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:07,988
PG&E has proposed that
they're liable...

1339
01:35:08,059 --> 01:35:11,995
anywhere between 50
and 400 million.

1340
01:35:12,063 --> 01:35:16,295
So... Wait a minute.
Let me just get this straight...

1341
01:35:16,367 --> 01:35:19,825
If we went to trial,
PG&E could stretch this
over ten years...

1342
01:35:19,904 --> 01:35:21,963
with appeal
after appeal.

1343
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,032
Those people
in Hinkley...
These people
are expecting a trial.

1344
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:26,974
That's what
we told them.

1345
01:35:27,045 --> 01:35:29,673
They won't understand this.

1346
01:35:31,416 --> 01:35:34,385
Kurt thinks it's
the best way to go.

1347
01:35:42,694 --> 01:35:48,291
[Kurt]
I promise you that we'll be
very sensitive on this point.

1348
01:35:48,366 --> 01:35:54,134
We will make sure that they
understand this is the only way
we can go forward at this time.

1349
01:35:54,205 --> 01:35:57,299
But we have a lot
of work to do...

1350
01:35:57,375 --> 01:36:00,936
before we even broach
that subject.

1351
01:36:02,046 --> 01:36:03,980
Why don't I take Erin
down the hall,

1352
01:36:04,048 --> 01:36:07,575
so we can start on this stuff,
and I'll fill her in on the rest
of the details.

1353
01:36:07,652 --> 01:36:10,746
[Kurt]
Thanks.
Those are my files.

1354
01:36:10,822 --> 01:36:13,313
Yeah, we had them
couriered over.

1355
01:36:13,391 --> 01:36:15,985
Listen, good work.
They're a great start.

1356
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:19,996
We're just going to have to
spend a little time filling in
the holes in your research.

1357
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:22,658
Excuse me.
Theresa, is it?

1358
01:36:22,734 --> 01:36:25,032
There are no holes
in my research.

1359
01:36:25,103 --> 01:36:28,869
No offense. There are just
some things we need that you
probably didn't know to ask.

1360
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:31,340
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot, okay?

1361
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:34,105
I may not have a law degree,
but I've spent 18 months
on this case,

1362
01:36:34,178 --> 01:36:37,614
and I know more about these
plaintiffs than you ever will.

1363
01:36:37,682 --> 01:36:41,209
Erin, you don't even have
phone numbers for some of them.

1364
01:36:41,286 --> 01:36:43,618
Whose number do you need?
[Theresa]
Everyone's.

1365
01:36:43,688 --> 01:36:46,452
This is a lawsuit.
We need to be able
to contact the plaintiffs.

1366
01:36:46,524 --> 01:36:48,924
I said,
"Whose number do you need?"

1367
01:36:48,993 --> 01:36:52,690
You don't know 600 plaintiffs'
numbers by heart.

1368
01:37:07,045 --> 01:37:12,950
- Annabelle Daniels.
- 714-454-9346.

1369
01:37:13,017 --> 01:37:15,542
Ten years old, eleven in May.
Lived on the plume since birth.

1370
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,554
Wanted to be
a synchronized swimmer,

1371
01:37:17,622 --> 01:37:21,251
so she spent every minute
she could in the PG&E pool.

1372
01:37:21,326 --> 01:37:23,487
She had a tumor
on her brain stem
detected last November,

1373
01:37:23,561 --> 01:37:26,758
an operation on Thanksgiving,
shrunk it with radiation
after that.

1374
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:29,800
Her parents are Ted and Rita.
Ted's got Crohn's disease.

1375
01:37:29,867 --> 01:37:33,928
Rita has chronic headaches
and nausea and underwent
a hysterectomy last fall.

1376
01:37:34,005 --> 01:37:36,769
Ted grew up in Hinkley.
His brother Robbie
and his wife May...

1377
01:37:36,841 --> 01:37:40,277
and their five children...
Robbie, Jr., Martha, Ed,
Rose and Peter...

1378
01:37:40,345 --> 01:37:42,472
also lived
on the plume.

1379
01:37:42,547 --> 01:37:46,984
Their number is 454-9554.
You want their diseases?

1380
01:37:51,422 --> 01:37:54,585
Okay, look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

1381
01:37:54,659 --> 01:37:58,652
That's all you got, lady:
Two wrong feet
and fucking ugly shoes.

1382
01:38:04,268 --> 01:38:06,202
[Erin]
She insulted me.

1383
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:08,295
Bullshit. It was
a misunderstanding.

1384
01:38:08,373 --> 01:38:11,638
Instead of handling it
politely, instead of
treating her with respect,

1385
01:38:11,709 --> 01:38:13,643
you insult her.
Why the fuck
should I respect her?

1386
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:15,645
Just because she's not
supporting three kids...

1387
01:38:15,713 --> 01:38:17,977
with no husband
and no education,
doesn't make her an idiot.

1388
01:38:18,049 --> 01:38:20,142
Just because
she dresses like a lawyer,

1389
01:38:20,218 --> 01:38:22,311
doesn't mean she didn't
work her ass off...

1390
01:38:22,387 --> 01:38:24,480
in law school
and shit positions
to earn her way.

1391
01:38:24,555 --> 01:38:26,614
Excuse me
for not going to law school.

1392
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:30,320
Law school?
I'd settle
for charm school!

1393
01:38:33,531 --> 01:38:37,262
[Cow Mooing]

1394
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:40,498
Mister... Mister...
Mr. Linwood!

1395
01:38:40,571 --> 01:38:44,905
[Clearing Throat]
Mr. Linwood?

1396
01:38:48,346 --> 01:38:50,414
Bob?

1397
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:57,787
[Erin Blowing Nose]
6086 Ridge Road,

1398
01:38:57,854 --> 01:39:02,655
[Clears Throat]
Hinkley, California.
714...

1399
01:39:02,726 --> 01:39:05,991
[Sneezes]
455...

1400
01:39:06,062 --> 01:39:10,362
[Theresa]
Okay, now, if you could
walk me through...

1401
01:39:10,434 --> 01:39:13,460
all of the elements of...

1402
01:39:13,537 --> 01:39:15,630
Annabelle's illnesses.

1403
01:39:15,705 --> 01:39:20,972
Specific details,
when the symptoms began...

1404
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:23,774
prior to the first
medical visit.

1405
01:39:23,847 --> 01:39:28,807
If you could reserve
sentimental embellishments,
I'd appreciate it.

1406
01:39:28,885 --> 01:39:31,615
They're not gonna help you
in court.
All right.

1407
01:39:31,688 --> 01:39:34,953
So I just need facts,
dates... time.

1408
01:39:35,025 --> 01:39:39,223
[Erin] I know Theresa
isn't real warm, but they say
she's a good lawyer.

1409
01:39:39,296 --> 01:39:41,924
[Ted]
She's asking the same
questions you asked.

1410
01:39:41,998 --> 01:39:45,092
I already told you everything.
I don't want her coming
to the house again.

1411
01:39:45,168 --> 01:39:48,262
She's kind of stuck-up,
and she upsets Annabelle.

1412
01:39:48,338 --> 01:39:51,432
If you don't like Theresa,
that's okay.

1413
01:39:51,508 --> 01:39:54,443
You know how important
Annabelle is to me.

1414
01:39:54,511 --> 01:39:56,604
Ed and I are still here
for you.

1415
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,275
I called Ed two days ago,
and he still hasn't
called me back.

1416
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:06,255
Now I hate to say this,
but... everyone's pretty upset
about this arbitration thing.

1417
01:40:06,323 --> 01:40:08,450
What?

1418
01:40:08,525 --> 01:40:10,823
Pamela's written a letter
in the Hinkley news...

1419
01:40:10,894 --> 01:40:14,990
telling everybody
to get new lawyers,
that we've been lied to.

1420
01:40:15,065 --> 01:40:18,296
Is it true?
No.
[Stammering]

1421
01:40:18,368 --> 01:40:21,462
Did you?
I'm telling you the truth,

1422
01:40:21,538 --> 01:40:23,802
and I will get
to the bottom of all this.

1423
01:40:23,874 --> 01:40:25,808
Don't lie to us.

1424
01:40:25,876 --> 01:40:29,312
I will take care of this.
I promise.
We're trusting you here.

1425
01:40:29,379 --> 01:40:33,008
Thanks.
I'll talk to you soon, okay?
All right. Bye-bye.

1426
01:40:36,019 --> 01:40:38,749
Ed, I'm not saying
it's not a strong case.

1427
01:40:38,822 --> 01:40:41,916
If it wasn't a strong case,
every demurrer wouldn't
have been dismissed.

1428
01:40:41,992 --> 01:40:45,792
I wouldn't be here.
What I am saying
is we still don't have...

1429
01:40:45,862 --> 01:40:48,695
a smoking gun that ties
San Francisco to Hinkley;

1430
01:40:48,765 --> 01:40:52,132
something that proves
that prior to 1987...

1431
01:40:52,202 --> 01:40:57,265
PG&E corporate knew
the water was bad in Hinkley
and did nothing about it.

1432
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:01,470
[Rosalind]
Hey, Erin, I thought
you were taking a sick day.

1433
01:41:01,545 --> 01:41:03,479
So did I.

1434
01:41:08,718 --> 01:41:12,449
What's going on
in there?
A meeting
about the PG&E thing.

1435
01:41:12,522 --> 01:41:14,581
Are you sure?
Yep.

1436
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,196
[Kurt]
We can find it
or we don't have a big win.

1437
01:41:20,263 --> 01:41:23,460
Can I take a brief break here
for a moment?

1438
01:41:23,533 --> 01:41:25,524
I'll be right back.

1439
01:41:27,971 --> 01:41:31,907
[Arguing, Indistinct]

1440
01:41:31,975 --> 01:41:34,967
[Arguing Continues]

1441
01:41:35,045 --> 01:41:38,242
You told me you weren't feeling
great. I wanted you to rest.
You know, that is bullshit.

1442
01:41:38,315 --> 01:41:40,579
Get in here.
If I was on my deathbed,

1443
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:43,244
if it helped you,
you'd drag me out of it!

1444
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:49,417
How could you
take this away from me?

1445
01:41:49,492 --> 01:41:53,428
Nobody's taking anything.
Bullshit!
You stuck me in Siberia...

1446
01:41:53,496 --> 01:41:56,431
dictating to some
goddamn steno clerk...

1447
01:41:56,499 --> 01:41:58,558
so you could
finish this without me!

1448
01:41:58,635 --> 01:42:03,095
They screwed up, Erin!
Do I have your attention now?
They admit it.

1449
01:42:03,173 --> 01:42:07,166
The arbitration proposal
they sent might as well have
been written in Sanskrit...

1450
01:42:07,243 --> 01:42:09,268
for all the sense it made
to the people in Hinkley.

1451
01:42:09,346 --> 01:42:13,874
I know. L-I spoke to Ted.
Pamela Duncan wouldn't even
get on the phone with me!

1452
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:16,783
Pamela's got everybody
seeing red with that letter
she wrote to the press.

1453
01:42:16,853 --> 01:42:18,787
She called us thieves.
They're all listening
to her.

1454
01:42:18,855 --> 01:42:21,119
The whole thing
is about to fall apart!
Why? Why?

1455
01:42:21,191 --> 01:42:23,284
Before we even go
to arbitration,

1456
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,294
we have to get
the plaintiffs to agree.
How many?

1457
01:42:25,362 --> 01:42:28,126
Usually they're required
to get about 70%.

1458
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:32,134
PG&E is demanding 90.
In other words, everybody.

1459
01:42:32,202 --> 01:42:34,397
Now do you understand?
This is serious.

1460
01:42:34,471 --> 01:42:36,962
And what?
I'm not serious?

1461
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,235
You're emotional.
You're erratic.

1462
01:42:39,309 --> 01:42:41,243
You say any goddamn thing
that comes into your head.

1463
01:42:41,311 --> 01:42:44,576
You make this personal
and it isn't.
Not personal?

1464
01:42:44,648 --> 01:42:48,584
That is my work, my sweat,
my time away from my kids!

1465
01:42:48,652 --> 01:42:51,746
If that's not personal,
I don't know what is!

1466
01:42:51,821 --> 01:42:56,485
[Coughing]

1467
01:42:56,559 --> 01:43:01,428
Come on.
Come on.

1468
01:43:01,498 --> 01:43:04,262
Go home.
Get well.

1469
01:43:04,334 --> 01:43:07,269
You're no good
to me sick.

1470
01:43:07,337 --> 01:43:09,931
I need you,
all right?

1471
01:43:10,006 --> 01:43:12,941
This case needs you.

1472
01:43:14,844 --> 01:43:17,506
Did you tell them that?

1473
01:43:41,871 --> 01:43:45,807
Binding arbitration
isn't all that different
from a trial.

1474
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:49,971
It's overseen by a judge,
evidence is presented
in much the same way.

1475
01:43:50,046 --> 01:43:52,105
[Man]
And then a jury decides?
[Coughs]

1476
01:43:52,181 --> 01:43:54,649
Oh, no. Sorry I forgot
to mention that.

1477
01:43:54,717 --> 01:43:57,880
There's no jury
in binding arbitration.
[Crowd Murmuring Loudly]

1478
01:43:57,954 --> 01:44:01,185
- No jury and no appeal.
- [Crowd Continues Murmuring]

1479
01:44:01,257 --> 01:44:04,283
What option do we have
if we don't like the result?

1480
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,555
You have none.
The judge's decision is final.

1481
01:44:06,629 --> 01:44:10,065
Not a good answer.
[Ed] We don't anticipate
that being a problem.

1482
01:44:10,132 --> 01:44:12,657
As I already told you,

1483
01:44:12,735 --> 01:44:16,796
it's definitely between
$50 and $400 million.

1484
01:44:16,872 --> 01:44:19,363
Well, which?
There's a big
difference there.

1485
01:44:19,442 --> 01:44:21,569
I wouldn't like
to speculate at this point.

1486
01:44:21,644 --> 01:44:25,045
[Tom Mumbling]
Well, how does it
get divided?

1487
01:44:25,114 --> 01:44:28,515
- Yeah. Who gets what?
- [Crowd Chattering]

1488
01:44:28,584 --> 01:44:34,318
My medical bills
started two years ago, before
some of the other people here.

1489
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:37,757
My daughter has been in and out
of hospitals more than his.

1490
01:44:37,827 --> 01:44:40,295
It shouldn't matter
when it started.
[Crowd Agreeing]

1491
01:44:40,363 --> 01:44:44,356
Just a minute, please.
People, listen, please!

1492
01:44:44,433 --> 01:44:46,901
The point we have
to address tonight...

1493
01:44:46,969 --> 01:44:51,201
is getting everyone
to agree that going
binding arbitration...

1494
01:44:51,273 --> 01:44:55,437
is preferable to a trial
that could go on for ten years
before you see any money.

1495
01:44:55,511 --> 01:44:59,675
Maybe some of us want
to wait ten years.

1496
01:44:59,749 --> 01:45:03,082
[Crowd Chattering]

1497
01:45:03,152 --> 01:45:06,679
Everyone has to agree
or no one has a chance.

1498
01:45:06,756 --> 01:45:10,055
Those of you about to leave,
I'd like you to keep
this date in mind:

1499
01:45:10,126 --> 01:45:12,321
1978.

1500
01:45:12,395 --> 01:45:15,660
That's the year
of the Love Canal controversy,

1501
01:45:15,731 --> 01:45:18,256
and those people are still
waiting for their money.

1502
01:45:18,334 --> 01:45:23,033
Think about where you'll be
in 15 or 20 years. Huh?

1503
01:45:23,105 --> 01:45:27,303
[Crowd Murmuring]

1504
01:45:27,376 --> 01:45:31,938
Look, everyone,
is this a big decision?

1505
01:45:32,014 --> 01:45:37,281
Absolutely.
But I do not believe
this is a sellout.

1506
01:45:37,353 --> 01:45:40,550
This is the best shot
at getting everyone
some money now!

1507
01:45:42,491 --> 01:45:45,221
You and I both know...

1508
01:45:45,294 --> 01:45:49,390
there are people in this room
who can't afford to wait...

1509
01:45:49,465 --> 01:45:51,899
to take that chance.

1510
01:45:51,967 --> 01:45:55,698
Are you gonna make them wait?

1511
01:46:01,744 --> 01:46:04,975
So how many
altogether?
[Sighs]

1512
01:46:05,047 --> 01:46:07,982
We got just about everybody
that came here tonight,

1513
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:10,814
but that still leaves us
about 150 short.

1514
01:46:10,886 --> 01:46:12,979
Oh, shit.

1515
01:46:13,055 --> 01:46:16,149
[Clears Throat]
We'll have to go
door-to-door.

1516
01:46:18,561 --> 01:46:20,995
I gotta go
pick up my kids.

1517
01:46:24,734 --> 01:46:27,999
You need a hand
with that?
No, I got it.

1518
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:34,572
Hey... you did good.

1519
01:46:35,911 --> 01:46:37,845
We'll see.

1520
01:46:37,913 --> 01:46:40,279
Yeah.

1521
01:47:07,877 --> 01:47:10,141
Hey.
Hey.

1522
01:47:12,381 --> 01:47:14,474
Thanks for coming.

1523
01:47:15,718 --> 01:47:18,653
[Sighs]

1524
01:47:18,721 --> 01:47:20,814
Don't take them anywhere
on your bike, okay?

1525
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:23,324
I'll give you some money
for a cab if you want
to go somewhere.

1526
01:47:23,392 --> 01:47:25,826
[Chuckles]
I got money.

1527
01:47:25,895 --> 01:47:29,331
So how long
is this gonna take?

1528
01:47:29,398 --> 01:47:32,834
Uh... I don't know.
A few days.

1529
01:47:34,336 --> 01:47:36,600
You got your own room.

1530
01:47:48,017 --> 01:47:50,645
I am really sorry, George.

1531
01:47:52,188 --> 01:47:54,179
Have the kids eaten?

1532
01:47:57,359 --> 01:47:59,293
No.

1533
01:48:20,049 --> 01:48:23,678
(sing)(music) I've wept for those
who suffer long (music)

1534
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:28,649
(sing)(music) But how I weep
for those who've gone (music)

1535
01:48:29,992 --> 01:48:34,793
(sing)(music) Into rooms of grief
and questioned wrong (music)

1536
01:48:34,864 --> 01:48:37,424
(sing)(music) But keep on killing (music)

1537
01:48:40,502 --> 01:48:44,438
(sing)(music) It's in the soul
to feel such things (music)

1538
01:48:45,641 --> 01:48:50,408
(sing)(music) But weak to watch
without speaking (music)

1539

sadness brings (music)

[George]
You want to get some pancakes?
Let's go. Everybody, up.

1542
01:49:11,033 --> 01:49:13,035
Everybody, up today.
All right.

1543
01:49:13,035 --> 01:49:15,003
Everybody, up today.
All right.

1544
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:17,470
Let's get some pancakes.
[Erin]
What time is it?

1545
01:49:17,539 --> 01:49:21,475
It's early.
I'm gonna take your car
and get some breakfast.

1546
01:49:21,543 --> 01:49:24,842
Mm-hmm.
No, I need my car.

1547
01:49:24,914 --> 01:49:27,314
We'll be back in a minute.

1548
01:49:27,383 --> 01:49:30,147
Okay.
Get some sleep.

1549
01:49:30,219 --> 01:49:33,154
Hey, Matt, buddy.
Let's go.
What?

1550
01:49:33,222 --> 01:49:36,248
Put it down.
Let's go.
I'll be there in a minute.

1551
01:49:37,993 --> 01:49:41,258
Let's go get some
pancakes, girlie.
Come on.

1552
01:49:50,406 --> 01:49:52,431
Baby, don't play with that.

1553
01:49:52,508 --> 01:49:55,238
It took me so long
to get it organized.
Will you put that back?

1554
01:49:55,311 --> 01:49:58,747
Please?
This girl is
the same age as me.

1555
01:50:04,019 --> 01:50:07,455
She's one of the sick people?

1556
01:50:07,523 --> 01:50:11,960
Uh... she is, but...
that's why I'm helping her.

1557
01:50:12,027 --> 01:50:14,359
We'll get her some medicine
and make her feel better.

1558
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:16,990
Why can't her own mama
help her?

1559
01:50:20,035 --> 01:50:22,162
Because her own mom
is real sick too.

1560
01:50:28,477 --> 01:50:31,071
[Sighs]

1561
01:50:35,818 --> 01:50:38,844
I'll bring you back
some breakfast.

1562
01:50:38,921 --> 01:50:41,446
You want eggs?

1563
01:50:43,492 --> 01:50:45,585
Eggs would be great.

[Chuckles Softly]

1566
01:50:53,502 --> 01:50:56,266
Eggs would be perfect.

1567
01:52:06,608 --> 01:52:09,441
Hey, Matt.
Hey, Erin,
how are you?

1568
01:52:09,511 --> 01:52:12,378
That's good.

1569
01:52:12,448 --> 01:52:15,349
So, been at this
all day?
Yeah.

1570
01:52:15,417 --> 01:52:17,612
You look tired.
You want some coffee?
I'd love some.

1571
01:52:17,686 --> 01:52:20,587
I'll make
a fresh pot.
Thanks.

1572
01:52:33,702 --> 01:52:37,035
[Men Laughing]

1573
01:52:45,447 --> 01:52:49,941
Hey,
don't I know you?
I don't think so.

1574
01:52:50,018 --> 01:52:53,078
Sure, you were
at the barbecue
in Hinkley...

1575
01:52:53,155 --> 01:52:55,749
and at the town meeting.
Hmm.

1576
01:52:55,824 --> 01:52:58,315
I was watching you.

1577
01:52:59,795 --> 01:53:02,389
I had my eye on you.

1578
01:53:03,966 --> 01:53:07,402
How nice.
Sure, you were talking
to everybody...

1579
01:53:07,469 --> 01:53:09,801
and writing down
a lot of stuff.

1580
01:53:09,872 --> 01:53:12,568
When I saw you,
I said to myself,

1581
01:53:12,641 --> 01:53:15,610
"There's something
about her.

1582
01:53:15,677 --> 01:53:18,237
I really like
that girl."

1583
01:53:20,048 --> 01:53:23,017
Matt, can I get that coffee
to go?
Sure thing.

1584
01:53:26,455 --> 01:53:30,016
I feel like I can talk
to you too.

1585
01:53:30,092 --> 01:53:33,823
Like you're the type
of person I could
say anything to.

1586
01:53:35,597 --> 01:53:37,656
Here you go.
Great.
What do I owe you?

1587
01:53:37,733 --> 01:53:41,191
There's no charge.
Thanks, Matt.

1588
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:44,262
Well,
nice talking to you.

1589
01:53:44,339 --> 01:53:46,933
Would it be important to you
if I told you that when I worked
at the Hinkley plant,

1590
01:53:47,009 --> 01:53:48,943
I destroyed documents?

1591
01:53:54,816 --> 01:53:58,115
Maybe.
[Sets Down Keys, Purse]

1592
01:53:58,186 --> 01:54:02,179
What did you say
your name was?
Charles Embry.

1593
01:54:02,257 --> 01:54:06,023
Charles, Erin.
Nice to meet you.

01:54:08,463 --> 01:54:10,727
Can you excuse me
for just a quick...

01:54:10,799 --> 01:54:12,733
Sure.
I'm just gonna run

Oh, you fucking piece of crap
with no signal!

1600
01:54:33,956 --> 01:54:36,618
Fuck! Oh.

[Phone Rings]

1602
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:54,702
Yeah?
[Erin]
Ed. Ed, oh, my God.

1603
01:54:54,776 --> 01:54:58,405
This guy Charles
said that he destroyed records.
He worked at Hinkley.

1604
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:02,382
Slow down, slow down.
I'm trying to relax
and this guy tells me...

1605
01:55:02,451 --> 01:55:04,385
Who? Who?
Charles Embry.

1606
01:55:04,453 --> 01:55:07,513
First I thought he was trying
to kill me, but then I thought
he was trying to pick me up.

1607
01:55:07,589 --> 01:55:10,080
Maybe he is, but why would
he say that? Why would he
use that as his line?

1608
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:13,924
It's crazy.
[Stammering]
Shit.

1609
01:55:13,996 --> 01:55:17,864
Now go back and see
if he'll make a declaration.

1610
01:55:17,933 --> 01:55:21,562
A declaration.
Yeah, but be careful.
Don't scare him off.

1611
01:55:21,637 --> 01:55:24,265
Now stay calm, stay calm.

1612
01:55:24,339 --> 01:55:28,207
Remember, if it weren't for you,
I'd be in Palm Springs now.

1613
01:55:28,276 --> 01:55:30,870
You're good at talking
people into things.

1614
01:55:30,946 --> 01:55:33,779
Don't pepper him with questions.
Don't do that.

1615
01:55:33,849 --> 01:55:36,215
Just... Just let...

1616
01:55:36,284 --> 01:55:40,084
People want to tell their story.
Just let him talk.

Let him do all
the talking, all right?
Okay.

Would you like another beer
or...

My cousin passed away
yesterday.

1622

He had kidney tumors,
no colon.

1623
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:15,915
His intestines
were eaten away.

1624
01:56:15,991 --> 01:56:18,619
Forty-one years old.

1625
01:56:18,694 --> 01:56:20,753
I remember seeing him
over at the plant.

1626
01:56:20,829 --> 01:56:24,765
He's be cleaning
the cooling towers,
wearing one of those...

1627
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:27,768
What do you
call them?
Mask?

1628
01:56:27,836 --> 01:56:30,202
Yeah, yeah.
Doctors' masks.

1629
01:56:30,272 --> 01:56:34,436
They'd be soaked in red
from the nosebleeds.

1630
01:56:47,122 --> 01:56:50,114
I was working
in the compressor.

1631
01:56:50,192 --> 01:56:52,786
Out of nowhere,
the supervisor calls me up
to the office...

1632
01:56:52,861 --> 01:56:55,955
and says,
"I'm gonna give you
a shredder machine...

1633
01:56:56,031 --> 01:57:00,058
and send you on down
to the warehouse to get rid
of the documents stored there."

1634
01:57:02,037 --> 01:57:03,971
Did he say why?

1635
01:57:04,039 --> 01:57:07,941
Nope...
and I didn't ask.

1636
01:57:11,313 --> 01:57:14,578
Did you get a look
at the stuff you destroyed?

1637
01:57:14,649 --> 01:57:17,482
A lot of dull stuff.
Vacation schedules
and the like.

1638
01:57:18,653 --> 01:57:20,587
But then there were
a few memos...

1639
01:57:20,655 --> 01:57:22,748
about the holding ponds,
the water in them...

1640
01:57:22,824 --> 01:57:25,588
and readings
from the test wells.

1641
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,628
Stuff like that.

1642
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:35,459
You were told
to destroy those?
That's right.

1643
01:57:37,506 --> 01:57:43,069
Of course, as it turns out,
I wasn't a very good employee.

1644
01:57:51,353 --> 01:57:52,454
[Chuckles]

1645
01:57:52,454 --> 01:57:53,284
[Chuckles]

1646
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:01,185
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.

1647
01:58:01,263 --> 01:58:03,891
Ed, Erin,
what's this?

1648
01:58:03,965 --> 01:58:06,729
May I?
[Ed]
Definitely. Go ahead.

1649
01:58:06,802 --> 01:58:10,067
[Erin Sighs]
Well... you know what,
Mr. Potter?

1650
01:58:10,138 --> 01:58:12,402
We completely forgot
your birthday this year,

1651
01:58:12,474 --> 01:58:17,241
and seeing as how
you've been so good to me,
it seemed a terrible oversight.

1652
01:58:17,312 --> 01:58:19,246
So what Ed and I
have been doing
the last few days...

1653
01:58:19,314 --> 01:58:21,544
is putting together
a present for you.

1654
01:58:21,616 --> 01:58:23,743
Six hundred
and thirty-four.

1655
01:58:23,819 --> 01:58:25,787
They're all signed.
Every single one.

1656
01:58:25,854 --> 01:58:29,654
Holy shit.
Now, don't go
getting jealous, Theresa.

1657
01:58:29,724 --> 01:58:32,818
She's getting jealous.
We have something
for you too.

1658
01:58:32,894 --> 01:58:36,591
Internal PG&E documents
all about the contamination.

1659
01:58:36,665 --> 01:58:38,599
The one
that I like best says...

1660
01:58:38,667 --> 01:58:42,626
I'm paraphrasing,
but it says: Yes,
the water's poisonous,

1661
01:58:42,704 --> 01:58:44,638
but it would be better
for all involved...

1662
01:58:44,706 --> 01:58:47,766
if this matter was not discussed
with the neighbors.

1663
01:58:47,843 --> 01:58:49,777
It's to the Hinkley station
from PG&E headquarters,

1664
01:58:49,845 --> 01:58:52,245
stamped,
"Received March 1966."

1665
01:58:52,314 --> 01:58:56,114
[Stammering]

1666
01:58:56,184 --> 01:58:58,209
H-How did you do this?

1667
01:58:58,286 --> 01:59:03,485
Well, seeing as
I have no brains
or legal expertise...

1668
01:59:03,558 --> 01:59:06,026
and Ed was losing all faith
in the system...
[Ed] Completely.

1669
01:59:06,094 --> 01:59:09,063
No faith, no faith.
I just went out there
and performed sexual favors:

1670
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:11,928
634 blow jobs
in five days.

1671
01:59:18,473 --> 01:59:22,239
I'm really quite tired.
[Chuckles]

1672
01:59:22,310 --> 01:59:25,336
[Sighs]

1673
01:59:29,317 --> 01:59:31,751
[Ed Chuckling]

1674
01:59:47,602 --> 01:59:51,094
I'm still not sure
why you wanted me to come.

1675
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:56,111
I want to show you
what you helped do.

1676
02:00:20,135 --> 02:00:22,831
Hey.
[Donna]
Hi.

1677
02:00:22,904 --> 02:00:25,065
How are you
feeling today?
Good, good.

1678
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:28,075
It's a good day.
Oh, I'm glad.

1679
02:00:28,143 --> 02:00:33,706
Well, come on in.
What a nice surprise
this is.

1680
02:00:33,781 --> 02:00:37,308
Um... Donna...

1681
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:44,754
I wanted to come out here
instead of calling...

1682
02:00:44,826 --> 02:00:48,853
because the judge
came back with a number.

1683
02:00:48,930 --> 02:00:51,922
[Sighs]

1684
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,094
Uh...

1685
02:00:55,170 --> 02:01:00,073
for the whole group
or... for us?

1686
02:01:00,141 --> 02:01:02,439
Both.

1687
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:08,142
He's gonna make them pay
333 million.

1688
02:01:10,285 --> 02:01:14,221
[Sighs, Laughs]
Oh, my God.
And...

1689
02:01:14,289 --> 02:01:16,154
And, um...

1690
02:01:16,224 --> 02:01:20,126
he's gonna make them
give 5 million of that
to your family.

1691
02:01:21,796 --> 02:01:25,323
Five million dollars?
Five million dollars.

1692
02:01:28,636 --> 02:01:32,231
[Laughing]
I don't even know
how much money that is.

1693
02:01:32,307 --> 02:01:36,243
Well, it's enough.
It's enough for whatever
you could ever need...

1694
02:01:36,311 --> 02:01:41,078
or whatever your girls need
or your girls' girls need.

1695
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:45,609
It will be enough.
[Crying]
Oh, Erin...

1696
02:01:45,687 --> 02:01:47,746
[Continues Crying]

1697
02:01:47,822 --> 02:01:51,087
Thank you so much.

1698
02:01:53,695 --> 02:01:56,994
[Softly]
It's over now.

1699
02:01:57,065 --> 02:01:59,659
[Donna Continues Crying]

1700
02:01:59,734 --> 02:02:03,192
I don't know what
I would have done without you.

1701
02:02:03,271 --> 02:02:07,264
It's a good day.
[Laughing]
Yes.

1702
02:02:07,342 --> 02:02:09,776
This is too much.

1703
02:02:19,787 --> 02:02:24,622
[Rosalind]
Masry & Vititoe.
Can l... Shoot.

1704
02:02:24,692 --> 02:02:26,956
[Phone Ringing]

1705
02:02:27,028 --> 02:02:29,292
Hi, I have a delivery
for Ed Masry.

1706
02:02:29,364 --> 02:02:33,130
It's the last office
down the corridor on the right.
Thank you.

1707
02:02:33,201 --> 02:02:38,503
Masry & Vititoe...
Damn it. Does anyone...

1708
02:02:38,573 --> 02:02:41,133
know anything
about these phones?

1709
02:02:45,146 --> 02:02:47,808
[Ed]
Everybody loves the desk
you picked out for me.

1710
02:02:47,882 --> 02:02:51,340
It's great.
Yeah.
[Knocking]

1711
02:02:51,419 --> 02:02:55,321
And guess who's on the cover
of Los Angeles Lawyer magazine?

1712
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:57,324
Talk to you later, baby.
Bye.

1713
02:03:02,063 --> 02:03:03,997
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1714
02:03:18,346 --> 02:03:21,281
I would rather walk her
through this in person.

1715
02:03:21,349 --> 02:03:24,443
There's some things
I want to show her:
Visual aids and documents.

1716
02:03:24,519 --> 02:03:29,456
If you could just
tell her I won't take up
too much of her time.

1717
02:03:29,524 --> 02:03:32,288
Right.

1718
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:36,626
It's a little more
complicated than Hinkley,
so let me do that.

1719
02:03:38,366 --> 02:03:41,130
Tell her I'm not a lawyer.
That may help.

1720
02:03:41,202 --> 02:03:44,638
Great.
Why don't you give me
the address now?

1721
02:03:44,706 --> 02:03:47,140
Just in case.

1722
02:03:47,208 --> 02:03:50,575
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

1723
02:03:50,645 --> 02:03:53,546
All right.
Thanks so much. Bye.

1724
02:03:53,614 --> 02:03:55,548
[Sighs]
What's up?

1725
02:03:55,616 --> 02:03:58,710
I, uh...
I have your bonus check.

1726
02:03:58,786 --> 02:04:02,813
Oh, yea...
But... now...

1727
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:06,087
I want you to be prepared.

1728
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:10,392
The figure's not exactly
what we discussed.

1729
02:04:13,334 --> 02:04:15,928
Why not?

1730
02:04:16,003 --> 02:04:19,962
Because,
after careful
consideration,

1731
02:04:20,041 --> 02:04:24,410
I felt that figure
was not... appropriate.

1732
02:04:24,479 --> 02:04:27,812
Although
you may not agree,

1733
02:04:27,882 --> 02:04:30,476
you'll have to trust
my experience...

1734
02:04:30,551 --> 02:04:33,611
Trust?
You want me to trust you?

1735
02:04:33,688 --> 02:04:36,486
Do me a favor, Ed.
Don't use big words
you don't understand.

1736
02:04:36,557 --> 02:04:39,651
It's a complicated issue.
You're not a qualified lawyer.
I did a job.

1737
02:04:39,727 --> 02:04:43,094
You should
reward me accordingly.
It's not complicated.

1738
02:04:43,164 --> 02:04:45,291
That is
the fucking
problem.

1739
02:04:45,366 --> 02:04:47,834
All you lawyers do
is complicate situations
that aren't complicated.

1740
02:04:47,902 --> 02:04:50,962
Do you know why people think
all lawyers are backstabbing,
bloodsucking scumbags?

1741
02:04:51,038 --> 02:04:54,940
Because they are.
I cannot believe you are
doing this to me now...

1742
02:04:55,009 --> 02:04:56,977
when I'm up to my ass
in Kettleman plaintiffs,

1743
02:04:57,044 --> 02:04:59,774
which looks like double
the amount we had in Hinkley.

1744
02:04:59,847 --> 02:05:01,781
You expect me
to go out there,

1745
02:05:01,849 --> 02:05:04,647
leave my kids to be
looked after by strangers,
knock on doors,

1746
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:07,620
get these people to trust you
with their lives, and the whole
time you're screwing me!

1747
02:05:09,157 --> 02:05:12,183
I want you to know
something, Ed. It is
not about the number.

1748
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:14,592
It is about the way my work
is valued in this firm.

1749
02:05:14,662 --> 02:05:17,631
It's about how no matter
what I do, you're not...

1750
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:24,729
As I was saying,

1751
02:05:24,806 --> 02:05:29,743
I decided that
the figure you proposed...

1752
02:05:29,811 --> 02:05:32,211
was inappropriate.

1753
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:34,214
So I increased it.

1754
02:05:45,026 --> 02:05:48,962
Do they teach beauty queens
how to apologize?

1755
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:52,397
Because you suck at it.

1756
02:06:05,146 --> 02:06:07,910
Uh, thank you, Ed.

1757
02:06:07,982 --> 02:06:10,246
(sing)(music) I hitched a ride (music)

1758
02:06:10,318 --> 02:06:12,411
(sing)(music) With a vending machine
repairman (music)

1759
02:06:12,487 --> 02:06:16,423
(sing)(music) He said he's been down
this road more than twice (music)

1760
02:06:16,491 --> 02:06:20,587
(sing)(music) He was high
on intellectualism (music)

1761
02:06:20,661 --> 02:06:25,621
(sing)(music) I've never been there
but the brochure looks nice (music)

1762
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:28,100
(sing)(music) Jump in
Let's go (music)

1763
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:32,606
(sing)(music) Lay back
Enjoy the show (music)

1764
02:06:32,673 --> 02:06:35,437
[Knocking]
(sing)(music) Everybody gets high (music)

1765
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:37,637
(sing)(music) Everybody gets low (music)

1766
02:06:37,712 --> 02:06:39,180
(sing)(music) These are the days
when anything goes (music)

1767
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:41,273
(sing)(music) These are the days
when anything goes (music)

1768
02:06:41,348 --> 02:06:44,784
(sing)(music) Every day
is a winding road (music)

1769
02:06:47,021 --> 02:06:49,615
