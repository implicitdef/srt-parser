00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,279
What do you mean, gay? We're together.

317
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,959
And domestic bliss must suit you, Molly.

318
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,159
You've put on three pounds
since I last saw you.

319
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,879
- Two-and-a-half.
- No, three.

320
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,799
- Sherlock.
- He's not gay!

321
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,599
- Why do you have to spoil...? He's not!
- With that level of personal grooming?

322
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,759
Because he puts a bit of product
in his hair? I put product in my hair.

323
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,279
You wash your hair,
there's a difference.

324
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,759
No, no - tinted eyelashes, clear signs
of taurine cream around the frown lines.

325
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,719
Those tired, clubber's eyes.

326
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,639
- Then there's his underwear.
- His underwear?

327
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,599
Visible above the waistline.
Very visible. Very particular brand.

328
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,559
Plus the extremely suggestive fact that
he just left his number under this dish.

329
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,839
I'd say you'd better break it off now
and save yourself the pain.

330
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,479
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Charming, well done(!)

331
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,839
Just saving her time. Isn't that kinder?

332
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,039
Kinder? No, no.
Sherlock, thatwasn't kind.

333
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,079
Go on, then.

334
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,679
Hm?

335
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,599
You know what I do. Off you go.

336
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,039
- Oh... No.
- Go on.

337
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,079
I'm not going to stand here
so you can humiliate me

338
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,159
- while I try and disseminate...
- An outside eye, a second opinion.

339
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,599
- It's very useful to me.
- Yeah, right(!)

340
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,839
Really!

341
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,239
Fine. (CLEARS THROAT)

342
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,159
Oh, they're just a pair of shoes.
Trainers!

343
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,679
Good.

344
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,319
Um...

345
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,799
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new,

346
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,319
except the sole has been well worn, so
the owner must have had them for a while.

347
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,439
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.

348
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,799
You're on sparkling form. What else?

349
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,719
They're quite big. A man's.

350
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,199
But...

351
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,999
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

352
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,199
Adults don't write their names inside
their shoes, so these belong to a kid.

353
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,479
Excellent. What else?

354
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,119
Er...

355
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,159
- That's it.
- That's it.

356
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
- How did I do?
- Well, John.

357
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,759
Really well.

358
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,839
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...

359
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,519
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.

360
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,959
Whitened them where they got discoloured.
Changed the laces three...

361
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,879
no, four times. Even so,
there are traces of his flaky skin

362
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,279
where his fingers have come into contact
with them, so he suffered from eczema.

363
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,279
The shoes are well worn,
more so on the inner side,

364
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,799
which means the owner had weak arches.

365
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,359
British-made, 20 years old.

366
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,319
- 20 years?
- They're not retro, they're original.

367
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,559
Limited edition - two blue stripes, 1 989.

368
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,279
There's still mud on them. They look new.

369
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,119
Someone's kept them that way.

370
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,199
Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles.

371
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,359
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

372
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,599
How do you know?

373
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,239
Pollen. Clear as a map reference to me.
South of the river, too.

374
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,239
So, the kid who owned these trainers
came to London from Sussex 20 years ago

375
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,479
- and left them behind.
- So, what happened to him?

376
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,319
Something bad.

377
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,039
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

378
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,079
Wouldn't let them go unless he had to.

379
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,919
So, a child with big feet gets...

380
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,999
Oh!

381
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,279
What?

382
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,359
Carl Powers.

383
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,519
- Sorry, who?
- Carl Powers, John.

384
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,319
What is it?

385
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,879
It's where I began.

386
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,319
1 989, young kid, champion swimmer,

387
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,279
came up from Brighton for a school
sports tournament, drowned in the pool.

388
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,719
Tragic accident. You wouldn't remember it.

389
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,439
- Why should you?
- But you remember.

390
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,159
- Yes.
- Something fishy about it?

391
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,799
Nobody thought so.

392
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,359
Nobody except me.

393
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,559
I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.

394
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,079
- You started young, didn't you?
- The boy, Carl Powers,

395
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,959
had some kind of fit in the water,

396
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,439
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

397
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,839
There was something wrong somewhere
and I couldn't get it out of my head.

398
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,399
- What?
- His shoes.

399
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,759
- What about them?
- They weren't there. I made a fuss.

400
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,439
I tried to get the police interested

401
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,479
but nobody seemed to think
it was important.

402
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,559
He'd left all the rest of his clothes
in his locker.

403
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,639
But there was no sign of his shoes.

404
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,559
Until now.

you could tell me about the dead man.

- No.
- What?

439
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,679
He had an Oyster card...

440
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,119
- ...but it hadn't been used.
- He must have bought a ticket.

441
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,679
- Hm. There was no ticket on the body.
- Then...

Then how did he end up with a bashed-in

- Remember the shoelaces.
- Mmm.

456
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,599
The boy suffered from eczema.
It would be the easiest thing in the world

to introduce the poison
into his medication.

458
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,119
Two hours later he comes up to London,

459
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,359
the poison takes effect,
paralyses the muscles and he drowns.

460
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,879
How come the autopsy didn't pick that up?

It's virtually undetectable.
Nobody would have been looking for it.

LESTRADE: She lives in Cornwall.

477
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,319
Two men broke in wearing masks,

478
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,919
forced her to drive to the car park

479
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,159
and decked her out in enough explosives
to take down a house.

Really strange that he hired a car.

Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

540
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,839
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew the tax
on the car, that's all.

Ah, well! That was Ian.

in the past tense.
She joined in. Bit premature.

- They've only just found the car.
- You think she murdered her husband.

Definitely not. That's not a mistake
a murderer would make.

But surely you can afford one -
a Mazda, I mean.

Yeah, that's a fair point.
You know how it is.

It's like working in a sweet shop.

- No, he was just a client.

He came in here
and hired one of my cars.

would love it, though - bit of sun.

How much blood was on that seat,
would you say?

593
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,039
How much? About a pint.

594
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,879
Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.

595
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,039
The blood's definitely Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.

596
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,559
- Frozen?
- There are clear signs.

597
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,799
I think Ian Monkford
gave a pint of his blood some time ago

598
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,879
- and that's what they spread on the seat.
- Who did?

599
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,319
Janus Cars. The clue's in the name.

600
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,639
- The god with two faces?
- Exactly.

Janus Cars will help you disappear.

604
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,879
Ian Monkford was up to his eyes
in some kind of trouble -

605
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,559
financial at a guess, he's a banker -
couldn't see a way out.

606
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,159
But if he were to vanish,
if the car he hired

607
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,519
was found abandoned with his blood
all over the driver's seat...

608
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,199
- So where is he?
- Colombia.

609
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,519
- Colombia?!
- Mr Ewart, ofJanus Cars,

610
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,119
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.

611
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,599
Quite a bit of change, too.

612
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,359
He told us he hadn't been abroad recently,

613
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,159
but when I asked him about the cars,
I could see his tan line clearly.

614
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,639
No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed.

615
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,599
- That, plus his arm.
- His arm?

616
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,879
He kept scratching it.
Obviously irritating him, and bleeding.

617
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,719
Why? Because he'd recently had
a boosterjab.

618
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,919
Hep-B, probably.
Difficult to tell at that distance.

619
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,359
Conclusion - he'd just come back
from settling Ian Monkford

620
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,799
into his new life in Colombia.

621
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,919
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance,
and she splits it with Janus Cars.

622
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,399
- Mrs Monkford?
- Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

623
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,159
Now, go and arrest them, Inspector,
that's what you do best.

624
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,479
We need to let our friendly bomber

No, he coated it
onto the claws of her cat.

I saw the scratches on her arm,

and too clever for the brother.

that the bomber had given us 1 2 hours.

00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,879
That is his trademark style.

936
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,799
- So this is a hit?
- Definitely.

937
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,039
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.

938
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,879
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...

939
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,559
You do see, you just don't observe!

940
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,279
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.

941
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,559
Sherlock, do you want
to take us through it?

942
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,159
What do we know about this corpse?

943
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,679
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.

944
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,919
They're pretty formal, maybe
he was going out for the night.

945
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,879
The trousers are heavy duty. Polyester,
nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.

946
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,679
They're both too big for him.
So some kind of standard-issue uniform.

947
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,439
Dressed for work, then. What kind of work?

948
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,239
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.

949
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,039
Tube driver?

950
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,719
- Security guard?
- More likely.

951
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,799
- That'll be borne out by his backside.
- Backside?!

952
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,039
Flabby, you'd think
he led a sedentary life.

953
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,599
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent
varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.

954
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,359
So, a lot of walking
anda lot of sitting around.

955
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,799
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.

956
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,879
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.

957
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,519
Why regular? Maybe he set his alarm
like that the night before he died?

958
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,759
No, no, no. The buttons
are stiff, hardly touched.

959
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,279
He set his alarm like that a long time
ago, his routine never varied.

960
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,039
But there's something else.
The killer must have been interrupted,

961
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,679
otherwise he would have stripped
the corpse completely.

962
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,839
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front

963
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,119
that he tore off, suggesting the dead man
works somewhere recognisable,

964
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,759
some kind of institution.

965
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,519
I found this inside his trouser pockets.

966
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,319
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...

967
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,759
- Tickets?
- Ticket stubs.

968
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,599
He worked in a museum or gallery.
Did a quick check.

969
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,319
The Hickman Gallery has reported
one of its attendants as missing,

970
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,839
Alex Woodbridge.

971
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,719
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.

972
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,919
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem

973
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,119
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

974
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,319
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it,

975
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,319
something that would stop the owner
getting paid £30 million.

976
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,119
- The pictures are fake.
- Fantastic.

977
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,919
- Meretricious.
- And a Happy New Year.

978
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,479
Poor sod.

979
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,519
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.

980
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,079
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

981
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,279
- Who?
- Me.

982
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,199
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?

983
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,119
- Waterloo Bridge.
- Where now, the gallery?

984
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,999
In a bit.

985
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,959
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?

986
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,599
Why have they got hold
of an old master?

987
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,679
Don't know.
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.

988
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,119
Need data...

989
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,399
Stop!

990
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,599
Can you wait here?

991
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,679
I won't be a moment.

992
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,199
Sherlock?

993
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,879
Change? Any change?

994
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,759
- What for?
- Cup of tea, of course.

995
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,079
Here you go, a 50.

996
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,799
Thanks.

997
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,079
- What are you doing?
- Investing.

998
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,999
Now we go to the gallery.

999
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,519
Have you got any cash?

1000
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,359
No, I need you to find out all you can
about the gallery attendant.

1001
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,279
- Lestrade will give you the address.
- OK.

1002
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,759
We'd been sharing about a year.

1003
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,439
- Just sharing.
- Mmm.

1004
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,319
- May I?
- Yeah.

1005
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,159
Sorry.

1006
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,879
Stargazer, was he?

1007
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,719
God, yeah. Mad about it.

1008
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,439
It's all he ever did in his spare time.

1009
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,919
He was a nice guy, Alex.

1010
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,879
I liked him.

1011
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,279
He was, er...

1012
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,439
never much of a one for hoovering.

1013
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,679
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?

1014
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,239
It was just a job, you know?

1015
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,439
Mmm.

1016
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,439
Has anyone else been round
asking about Alex?

1017
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,719
No.

1018
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,119
We had a break-in, though.

1019
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,999
- When?
- Last night.

1020
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,079
There was nothing taken.

1021
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,999
Oh, there was a message
left for Alex on the land line.

1022
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,319
- Who was it from?
- I can play it for you, if you like.

1023
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,599
- I'll get the phone...
- Please.

Love, it's Professor Cairns.

1027
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,079
Listen, you were right.
You were bloody right.

1028
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,319
Give us a call when...

1029
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,119
Professor Cairns?

1030
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,239
- No idea, sorry.
- Mmm.

1031
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,519
Can I try and ring back?

1032
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:30,199
No good. I've had other calls since.
Sympathy ones, you know.

Don't you have something to do?

1035
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,039
Just admiring the view.

1036
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,759
Yes.

1037
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,359
Lovely. Now go back to work -
we open tonight.

1038
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,039
- Doesn't it bother you?
- What?

1039
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,399
That the painting's a fake.

1040
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,559
- What?
- It's a fake. It has to be.

1041
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,279
It's the only possible explanation.

1042
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,559
You are in charge, aren't you,
Miss Wenceslas?

1043
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,799
Who are you?

1044
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,919
Alex Woodbridge knew
that the painting was a fake,

1045
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,799
so somebody sent the Golem
to take care of him. Was it you?

1046
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,759
Golem? What the hell
are you talking about?

1047
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,519
Are you working for someone else?
Did you fake it for them?

1048
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,039
It's not a fake.

1049
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,799
It is a fake.

1050
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,079
I don't know why. But there's something
wrong with it, there has to be.

1051
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,799
What the hell are you on about?
You know I could have you

1052
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,119
- sacked on the spot.
- Not a problem.

1053
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,919
- No?
- No, I don't work here, you see.

Just popped in to give you
a bit of friendly advice.

01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,959
How did you get in?

1056
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,119
- Please!
- I want to know.

1057
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,439
The art of disguise is knowing
how to hide in plain sight.

- Sherlock Holmes.

- Westie wasn't a traitor.

It's a horrible thing to say!

1066

I'm sorry.
But you must understand...

1067

That's what they think,
isn't it, his bosses?

1068
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,199
He was young man,
about to get married, he had debts.

1069
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,359
Everyone's got debts,

1070
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,239
and Westie wouldn't want to clear them
by selling out his country.

1071
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,559
Can you, erm...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

1072
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,679
We were having a night in.

but he sat through this one.

He was quiet.

1076
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,959
Out of the blue he said he just
had to go and see someone.

1242
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,919
How did he end up here?

1243
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,479
(CLANKING)

1244
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,839
- The points.
- Yes!

1245
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,079
I knew you'd get there eventually.

1246
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,679
West wasn't killed here,
that's why there was so little blood.

1247
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,999
- How long have you been following me?
- Since the start.

1248
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,879
You don't think
I'd give up on a case like this

1249
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,759
just to spite my brother, do you?

1250
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,239
Come on,
we've got a bit of burglary to do.

1251
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,559
Missile defence plans
haven't left the country,

1252
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,159
otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.

1253
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,519
Despite what people think,
we do still have a secret service.

1254
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,719
Yeah, I know, I've met them.

1255
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,279
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it

1256
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,879
or doesn't know what to do with it.

1257
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,839
My money's on the latter.

1258
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,399
We're here.

1259
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,039
Where?

1260
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,119
Sherlock! What if there's someone in?

1261
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,839
There isn't.

1262
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,879
WATSON: Jesus...

1263
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,039
- Where are we?
- Oh, sorry, didn't I say?

1264
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,639
Joe Harrison's flat.

1265
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,159
Joe...?

1266
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,239
Brother of West's fiancée.
He stole the memory stick,

1267
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,599
killed his prospective brother-in-law.

1268
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,719
Then why did he do it?

1269
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,679
(KEYS RATTLING)

1270
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,199
Let's ask him.

1271
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,959
Don't! Don't.

1272
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,159
He wasn't meant to...

1273
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,879
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

1274
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,199
Why did you kill him?

1275
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,359
It was an accident. I swear it was.

1276
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,759
But stealing the plans
for the missile defence program

1277
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,319
wasn't an accident, was it?

1278
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,519
I started dealing drugs.

1279
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,399
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?

1280
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,959
I don't know how it started.

1281
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,319
I just got out of my depth.

1282
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:38,799
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.

1283
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,479
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.

1284
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,519
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

1285
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,439
But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

1286
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,679
He told me about these missile plans.

1287
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,359
Beyond top secret.

1288
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,239
He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.

1289
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,999
You hear about these things getting lost,

1290
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,079
ending up on rubbish tips and whatnot.

1291
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,399
But there it was. And I thought...

1292
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,439
Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.

1293
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,519
It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.

1294
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,319
Next time I saw him,

1295
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,639
I could tell by the look on his face
that he knew.

1296
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,639
- What are you doing here?
- What have you done with the plans?

1297
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,239
What happened?

1298
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,479
I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

1299
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,319
I just didn't have a clue what to do.

1300
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,919
So I dragged him in 'ere.

1301
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,159
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

1302
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,599
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.

1303
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:36,159
Carrying Andrew West way away from here.

1304
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,839
His body would have gone on for ages

1305
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,919
if the train hadn't hit
a stretch of track with curves.

1306
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,079
-WATSON: And points.
- Exactly.

1307
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,279
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?

1308
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,839
Fetch it for me, if you wouldn't mind.

1309
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,279
Distraction over - the game continues.

1310
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,959
Maybe that's over, too.
We've heard nothing from the bomber.

1311
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,439
Five pips, remember, John.

1312
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,279
It's a countdown. We've only had four.

(SHOUTING ON TELEVISION)

1314
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:21,479
No, no, no!
Course he's not the boy's father.

1315
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,719
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

1316
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,999
- I knew it was dangerous.
- Hm?

1317
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,199
Getting you into crap telly.

1318
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,919
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

1319
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,959
Have you given Mycroft
the memory stick yet?

1320
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,359
Yep. He was over the moon.

- You know, I'm still waiting.
- Hm?

1323
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,879
For you to admit that a little knowledge
of the solar system

1324
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,519
and you'd have cleared up
the fake painting a lot quicker.

No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.

01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,359
- True.
- I won't be in for tea.

1328
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,439
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still
some of that risotto left in the fridge.

1329
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,079
- Milk, we need milk.
- I'll get some.

1330
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,839
- Really?
- Really.

1331
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,719
- And some beans, then?
- Mm.

- Bet you never saw this coming.

to make him say...next?

- gottle o' gear.
- Stop it.

Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?

But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.

01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,799
The missile plans.

1397
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,279
Boring!

1398
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,359
I could have got them anywhere.

1399
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:46,319
- Sherlock, run!
- (LAUGHS) Good!

1400
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,559
Very good.

1401
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,719
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

1402
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,199
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.

1403
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,199
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.

1404
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,079
They're so touchingly loyal.

1405
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,399
But oops!

1406
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,199
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.

1407
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,039
Gotcha.

1408
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:24,199
Westwood. Do you know what happens if you
don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you?

1409
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,999
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

1410
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,479
Kill you?

1411
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,959
No, don't be obvious. I mean,
I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.

1412
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,799
I don't want to rush it, though.

1413
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,999
I'm saving it up for something special.

1414
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:43,079
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you.

1415
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:50,079
I'll burn the heart out of you.

1416
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,799
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.

1417
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,879
But we both know that's not quite true.

1418
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:04,079
Well, I'd better be off.

1419
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,359
Well, so nice to have had a proper chat.

1420
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,239
What if I was to shoot you now?

1421
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,519
Right now?

1422
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,799
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.

1423
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,599
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

1424
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,359
Really, I would.

1425
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:23,959
And just a teensy bit...disappointed.

1426
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,119
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.

1427
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:34,159
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

1428
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:40,479
Catch you...later.

1429
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,399
- No, you won't!
- (DOOR CLOSES)

1430
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,239
All right? Are you all right?

1431
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:56,359
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...

1432
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,239
Sherlock!

1433
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,599
(GASPING)

1434
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,479
Oh, Christ.

1435
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:20,439
- Are you OK?
- Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

1436
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,839
That, er...thing that you...
that you did,

1437
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,359
that, um...you offered to do...
that was, um...good.

1438
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,839
- I'm glad no-one saw that.
- Mm?

1439
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,919
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.

1440
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,039
People might talk.

1441
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,919
They do little else.

1442
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,919
- Oh...
- Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

1443
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,679
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,

1444
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,479
it is my only weakness.

1445
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,359
You can't be allowed to continue.

1446
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,879
You just can't.

1447
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,479
I would try to convince you,

1448
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:12,399
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.
