- Just moved in.
- What?

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,359
- Floor above, new label.
- Could have just replaced it.

Hi, um, I live in the flat
just below you. I don't think we've met.

170
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,799
No, well, er, I've just moved in.

171
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,919
Actually, I've just locked
my keys in my flat.

172
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,319
Do you want me to buzz you in?

173
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,879
Yeah. And can we use your balcony?

178
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,519
Yeah, any time
you feel like letting me in(!)

179

Do you think he'd lost a lot of money?

180
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,039
Suicide is pretty common
among City boys.

181

- We don't know that it was suicide.
- Come on.

The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

judging by the laundry.

184

Look at the case, there was something
tightly packed inside it.

- Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
- Problem?

Yeah, I'm not desperate to root around
some bloke's dirty underwear.

187
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,719
Those symbols at the bank,
the graffiti, why were they put there?

188
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,799
- Some sort of code?
- Obviously.

189
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,199
Why were they painted? Want to
communicate, why not use e-mail?

190

Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

would everyone try to avoid?

- Bills?

Yes. He was being threatened.

Yeah, I know who you are

and I would prefer it if you didn't
tamper with any of the evidence.

- He's busy. I'm in charge.

And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

We're obviously looking at a suicide.

206
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,279
It does seem
the only explanation of all the facts.

207
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,839
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

208

You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing

to ignore anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

- Like?
- Wound's on the right side of his head.

211
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,479
- And?
- Van Coon was left-handed.

212
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,839
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

213
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,079
Left-handed?

214
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,559
I'm amazed you didn't notice. All you
have to do is look around this flat.

215
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,439
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

216
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,119
coffee mug handle pointing to the left.

217
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,519
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

218
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,879
on the left of the phone. Picked up with
his right, took messages with his left.

219
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,679
- D'you want me to go on?
- No, I think you've covered it.

220
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
I might as well,
I'm almost at the bottom of the list.

221
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,159
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side of the blade

222
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,839
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

223
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,079
that a left-handed man would shoot himself
in the right side of his head.

224
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,239
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

225
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,199
only explanation of allof the facts.

226
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,279
- But the gun?
- He was waiting for the killer.

227
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,159
- He'd been threatened.
- What?

228
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,999
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

229
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,039
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

230
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,559
- And the bullet?
- Went through the open window.

231
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,479
Oh, come on (!)

232
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
What are the chances of that?!

233
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,479
Wait until you get the ballistics report.

234
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,239
The bullet in his brain wasn't fired
from his gun, I guarantee it.

235
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,519
But if his door was locked from
the inside, how did the killer get in?

236
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,439
Good, you're finally asking
the rightquestions.

237
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,719
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

238
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,479
which of course can never be done.

Four floors up.

That's why they think they're safe.

Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're impregnable.

They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

- Dealing with a killer who can climb.

320
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,639
- What are you doing?
- Clings to the walls like an insect.

- What?!

323
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,839
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

324
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,759
dropped in through this skylight.

325

You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

327
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,679
- jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon.
- Oh, hold on (!)

328
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,199
That's how he got into the bank - ran
along the window ledge onto the terrace.

I have to find out
what connects these two men.

So, the killer goes to the bank,

333
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,119
leaves a threatening cipher at the bank.

334
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,879
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

Hours later, he dies.

he writes the cipher

on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

338

Late that night, he dies too.

- Lost 5 million.
- Made it back in a week.

But why did they die?

485
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,639
It doesn't make sense. If they both
turn up at the shop and deliver the goods,

486
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,279
why would someone threaten them

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,319
- Zhi Zhu?
- The spider.

630
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,879
You know this mark?

631
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,959
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

632
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,679
- Huh?
- Ancient crime syndicate, based in China.

633
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,639
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

634
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,919
Everyone who hauls for them.

635
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,879
Hauls?

636
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,399
You mean you were a smuggler?

637
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,399
I was 1 5.

638
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,999
My parents were dead.

639
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,039
I had no livelihood.

640
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,679
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

641
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,759
except to work for the bosses.

642
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,519
Who are they?

643
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,599
They are called the Black Lotus.

644
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,919
By the time I was 1 6,

645
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,119
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

646
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,079
across the border into Hong Kong.

647
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,959
I managed to leave that life behind me.

648
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,719
I came to England.

649
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,639
They gave me a job, here.

650
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,439
Everything was good. New life.

651
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,239
And he came looking for you.

652
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,759
Yes.

653
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,999
I hoped, after five years...

654
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,119
maybe they would have forgotten me.

655
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,039
But they never really let you leave.

656
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,559
A small community like ours...

657
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,159
...they are never very far away.

658
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,159
He came to my flat.

659
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,799
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

660
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,679
And you've no idea what it was?

661
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,999
I refused to help.

662
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,359
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

663
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,079
Oh, yes.

664
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,759
He's my brother.

665
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,919
Two orphans.

666
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,799
We had no choice.

667
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,119
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like beggars.

668
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,279
My brother has become their puppet.

669
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,919
In the power of the one they call Shan.

670
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,719
The Black Lotus general.

671
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,399
I turned my brother away.

672
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,079
He said I had betrayed him.

673
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,999
Next day, I came to work

674
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,439
and the cipher was waiting.

675
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,679
Can you decipher these?

676
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,999
- These are numbers.
- Yes, I know.

677
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,399
Here, the line across the man's eyes,
it's the Chinese number one.

678
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,159
And this one is 1 5.
But what's the code?

679
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,679

680
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,359
It's based upon a book...

were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

- Need to examine some bodies.

Well...their paperwork's
already gone through.

00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,519
- You changed your hair.
- What?

725
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,119
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

- Yes.

- Oh!
- So...

00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,639
So either these two men just happened
to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour,

735

- or I'm telling the truth.
- What do you want?

I want every book from Lukis's apartment

Yes, Shan. General Shan.

She gave us most of the missing pieces.

745
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,079
Why did he need to visit his sister?

746
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,719
- Why did he need herexpertise?
- She worked at the museum.

747
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,959
- Exactly.
- An expert in antiquities.

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,559

All of them from an anonymous source.

765
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,719
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them into Britain.

766
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,079
Every single auction coincides with
Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.

767
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,279
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

768
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,839
What if one of them stole something?

To books.

775
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,719
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

776
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,999
Right, so...

and it's the first word you read.

779
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,719
- OK, so what's the message?
- Depends on the book.

That's the cunning of the book code.

- HOLMES: He brought you a present.

1108
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,159
Oh, hello.

1109
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,839
A little gift
when he came back from China.

1110
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,239
- How do you know that?
- You weren't just his PA, were you?

1111
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,839
Someone's been gossiping.

1112
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,639
- No.
- Then I don't understand why...

1113
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,639
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1114
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,079
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1115
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,959
- Sorry...?

1116
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,039
I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type
of chap to buy himself hand soap,

1117
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,199
not unless he had a lady coming over.

1118
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,839
And it's the same brand
as that hand cream there on your desk.

1119
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,399
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1120
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,999
It was over in a flash, it couldn't last.
He was my boss.

1121
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,679
What happened? Why did you end it?

1122
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,679
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1123
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,479
Took me for granted.

1124
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,759
Stood me up once too often.

1125
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,559
We'd plan to go away for the weekend
and then he'd just leave.

1126
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,279
Fly off to China at a moment's notice.

1127
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,599
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

1128
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,279
Can I just have a look at it?

1129
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,199
He really climbed up onto the balcony?

1130
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,399
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

1131
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,199
Thanks.

1132
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,679
He said he bought it
in a street market.

1133
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,599
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

1134
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,159
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1135
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,559
Didn't know its value, just thought
it would suit you.

1136
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,519
Oh? What's it worth?

1137
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,759
£9 million.

1138
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,959
Oh, my God.

1139
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,559
Oh, my God!

1140
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,679
Nine million?!

1141
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,279
Over 1 ,000 years old

1142
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,439
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

1143
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,519
He didn't know its value.
Didn't know why they were chasing him.

1144
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,759
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

1145
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,119
- You mind, don't you?
- What?

1146
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,039
That she escaped. General Shan.

1147
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,999
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

1148
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,839
Must be a vast network, John.

1149
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,599
Thousands of operatives.

1150
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,119
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

1151
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,239
You cracked the code though, Sherlock.

1152
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,119
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them, now he knows it.

1153
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,479
No. No, I crack this code,

1154
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,639
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

1155
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,719
Without you...

1156
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,719
without your assistance,

1157
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,999
we would not have found
passage into London.

1158
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,439
You have my thanks.

1159
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,319
We did not anticipate...

1160
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,879
We did not know this man would come.

1161
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,359
This Sherlock Holmes.

1162
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,479
And now your safety is compromised.

1163
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,919
I will not reveal your identity.
