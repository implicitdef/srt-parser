LaLAURIE:
Ah, Governor and Mrs. Roman,

4
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:14,278
you honor our home
with your presence.

5
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:16,048
May I present my son,

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,484
Jacques.

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,186
And this is my oldest,

8
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:21,237
Borquita.

9
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,440
Charmed.

10
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:27,589
My, my, Jacques,

11
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,991
what a suave fellow you are.

12
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,044
But I wonder
if you're brave enough

13
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:34,671
to visit my Chamber of Horrors.

14
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:38,467
Mother, I doubt that Jacques

15
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,052
is interested.

16
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,720
I might find the courage
if the lovely Borquita

17
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:42,855
was by my side.

18
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,640
I fairly swoon

19
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:46,475
when I see the moment of terror
register

20
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,310
on a handsome face.

21
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,900
Makes me feel young again.

22
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:53,148
(chuckles)

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,199
This way.

24
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:06,995
Can you guess
what's in the bowl?

25
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:10,883
(squishing sounds)

26
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,834
Madame LaLaurie,

27
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:15,576
it must have taken you all
afternoon to peel these grapes.

28
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,926
(screaming)

29
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:23,562
(chuckles)

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,596
Would you care to try

31
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:28,883
your hand at the next surprise?

32
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:30,152
I'll give you a hint.

33
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,154
They're long

34
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,323
and... wet and...

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,991
very slippery.

36
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:38,076
(squishing sounds)

37
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,582
I'd... venture to guess
a string of sausages?

38
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,450
(chuckles)
(man screams)

39
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,402
(screams, grunts)

40
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,574
(laughs)

41
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,044
Oh, you're not man enough

42
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,546
for my Borquita,

43
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:00,749
much less my Chamber of Horrors.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,468
(laughs)

45
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:05,645
BORQUITA:
<i>I'll never have a husband.</i>

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,230
Not with Mother around.

47
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:08,118
She's horrible.

48
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,988
To us and the slaves.

49
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:14,070
Who would ever suspect foul play

50
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,573
from the grieving daughters
of their beloved mother's

51
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,458
untimely death?

52
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,410
You are wicked, Borquita.

53
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:22,295
The only question is how.

54
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,600
(door opens)

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,032
Mother.
Y'all gonna miss the entire party

56
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,968
if you sit up here chattering
like little birds.

57
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,471
Come on downstairs now
and be festive,

58
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,223
my darlings.

59
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:36,259
Dessert is about to be served.

60
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:39,378
(door closes)

61
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,730
LOUIS:
My dear,

62
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,637
the guests have been asking
after you.

63
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:45,935
Send me Bastien
and two strong slaves.

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,654
Don't ponder, Louis.

65
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49,555
Just do it!

66
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,225
(crickets chirping)

67
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,527
(floorboards creaking softly)

68
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,398
(gasps)

69
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,000
(screams)

70
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:03,503
(shouting)
No!

71
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,621
No!

72
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,756
(Borquita panting, crying)

73
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:15,715
(men grunting)

74
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:19,469
(Borquita screaming)

75
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,006
Break her leg if you must.

76
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:28,250
(screams)

77
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,697
We were never
gonna do anything.

78
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:32,765
It was just silly talk.

79
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:36,602
It's because of my love
for your plain faces

80
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:38,455
that you can still draw breath.

81
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,609
Be good, little birds,

82
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:47,497
and I'll set you
free in a year.

83
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:48,809
A year?

84
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,355
Just in time
for next Hallows' Eve. Ooh...

85
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,934
And you, ringleader

86
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:59,726
of the feebleminded,

87
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:02,120
you've earned a special present.

88
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,730
On Christmas morning,

89
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,798
I'm gonna stuff
your conniving mouth

90
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,916
full of shit.

91
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:08,184
No.

92
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,153
No!

93
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:13,806
No! (sobs)
No! No! No!

94
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,658
No!

95
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,652
(cries)
It's too late now

96
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:29,488
even to light the bonfires
of protection.

97
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:34,460
All hell has opened up
on our doorstep.

98
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:36,095
QUEENIE: You guys,
did you get a load

99
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:37,997
of what's going on outside?

100

101
00:05:58,135 --> 00:05:59,368
(echoing scream)

102
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:00,753
(distorted wailing)

103
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,505
(distorted):
No.

104
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,540
CORDELIA (distorted):
I need my mother!

105
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:06,459
Move!

106
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:07,847
Let me see your face!

107
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,879
It's burning!
Oh, my God! Someone call an ambulance!

108
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,281
My God! Somebody help us!

109
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:21,891
Let me see!
I have to see!

110
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:24,760
Let me see it!
(wailing)

111
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:26,095
(screams)

112
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,451
(sighs)

113
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,326
(indistinct radio transmissions)

114
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,997
Are you
Mrs. Foxx's mother?

115
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,118
What did they do to her?

116
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,918
Her eyes looked like marbles.

117
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,254
Our best guess is someone threw
sulfuric acid on her.

118
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:55,518
I've only seen burns like this
in industrial accidents.

119
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,094
It burned
through the optic nerves.

120
00:06:58,614 --> 00:06:59,733
I'm no...

121
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,015
debutante, Doctor.
So just tell me.

122
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:06,253
Is she blind or not?

123
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,443
The ocular structure's intact,
but...

124
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,078
we couldn't save her eyesight.

125
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:12,197
You... What are you saying?

126
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:13,815
What are you telling me?

127
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,748
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,904
What are you telling me?

129
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:18,787
Huh? You piece of shit!

130
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,955
I want to talk to a doctor!

131
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,703
(crying): No.
Should I call the cops?

132
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,992
No, it's all right.
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,295
(crying)

134
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,055
ZOE:
What are they?

135
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:37,919
They're dead.

136
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,841
I can't hear them.

137
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:46,448
Everyone get away
from the windows.

138
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,450
Come on! And kill the lights.

139
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:49,951
QUEENIE:
Um, I think

140
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:51,866
they know we're home.
Close the drapes.

141
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,372
We need Fiona.
You guys, it's a prank.

142
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:56,491
They're not even doing anything.

143
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,662
(groans)
It's her voice mail.

144
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,861
I don't know. Maybe we should call the cops.
No,

145
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,061
Fiona wouldn't like it,
and I'd be more scared of her

146
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:07,085
than those things outside.

147
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,252
Oh, shit.

148
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:09,871
You shouldn't be out of bed.

149
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,402
Tell it to the Army
of Darkness.

150
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:12,401
LUKE:
This is crazy.

151
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:14,876
I can handle a bunch
of neighborhood kids.

152
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:37,939
Okay, you had your fun.

153
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,535
You spooked a houseful
of girls. Time to go.

154
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:44,088
Come on, buddy.

155
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,342
Hey.

156
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,878
(chuckles)
Okay.

157
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,462
Come on. Get moving.

158
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,765
(gate creaks)

159
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:58,269
Dude, your prosthetics
look awesome.

160
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,638
(snaps fingers)

161
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,425
Oh, man.

162
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,238
Begin.

163
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:25,780
(low growling)

164
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,917
(snarling)

165
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,051
(grunting)

166
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:31,252
(screaming)

167
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,129
(screams)

168
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:42,931
Luke!

169
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,131
Come on.

170
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,067
We got to help Luke!

171
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,414
QUEENIE: The front
door's no good.

172
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,242
We're completely surrounded.

173
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:52,440
If we can't go out, we'll go up.

174
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,275
We have to get away
from all these windows.

175
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,611
Spalding!

176
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:05,163
(door unlocks)

177
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:06,921
Are you crazy?

178
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,197
My daughters are out there.

179
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,575
Your daughters are dead!
You want to be dead, too?

180
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:13,327
'Tis a consummation devoutly
to be wished.

181
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,330
Come on.

182
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,349
Queenie, do you think
you can make it up to the attic?

183
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:20,218
Spalding's room-- We can
barricade ourselves inside.

184
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,936
Fine. Then pick a room!

185
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:23,564
Okay? Just get upstairs! Go!

186
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:25,310
Now!

187
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,775
Nan?

188
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,010
ZOE:
Shit!

189
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,648
(Nan grunts)
(groans) Aah! Nan!

190
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,683
Save yourself. Go.

191
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:36,618
I'm not leaving you here.

192
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,536
Cordelia's car. Come on!

193
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:40,521
(groaning)
(groans)

194
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,909
(gasps)

195
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,412
(Nan screams)

196
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:49,363
(growling)

197
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,532
What are they?
What do they want?

198
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,201
Us.
(panting)

199
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,040
(quiet mechanical beeping
and whooshing)

200
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,587
(electrical buzzing)

201
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,149
(whoosh)

202
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,535
(beep, door clicks open)

203
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:02,904
(electrical buzzing continues)

204
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:31,966
(wheels squeaking)

205
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:37,155
(loud, metallic clattering,
gasping)

206
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:43,995
(distant shouting)

207
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,653
(Fiona gasps)

208
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,792
You didn't throw that acid,
but you might as well have.

209
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,927
(Fiona gasps)

210
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,680
(man breaths loudly)

211
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,882
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Code blue NICU, bed five.

212
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,051
Code blue NICU, bed five.

213
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,553
(loud beep over P.A. system)

214
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:09,837
MAN (over P.A.):
Team to ICU...

215
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,888
(continues indistinctly)

216
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:17,895
(woman crying)

217
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,398
(woman screams, sobs)

218
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:22,700
(crying)

219
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,039
(crying continues)

220
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,420
Stillborn, or did it die after?

221
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:44,922
Stillborn.

222
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,009
Is it a girl or a boy?

223
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,228
They didn't tell me.

224
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,765
She's a girl.

225
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,152
Who are you?

226
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,489
What are you doing?

227
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,524
No!

228
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,776
No, I don't want
to look at her!

229
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,829
(crying): No, I don't
want to look at her.

230
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,864
Come on, hold her.

231
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,666
Oh. 
Hold her. She's your daughter.

232
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:14,785
You have to keep them close

233
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,206
so they feel safe.

234
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,714
Now talk to her.

235
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,966
I don't understand.

236
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,584
Why are you doing this?

237
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,220
My baby is dead.
No.

238
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,388
No, no, no, no.

239
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,590
Come on, talk to her.

240
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,425
(crying)

241
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,429
Tell her... "I love you more
than the whole world."

242
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,733
Come on.

243
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,285
Say it to her.

244
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:50,538
I love you more than
the whole world.

245
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:54,208
You're the most beautiful baby.

246
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,277
Tell her how beautiful she is.

247
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,713
Please. I can't... do this.

248
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,248
Tell her how beautiful she is.

249
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,782
You're so beautiful.

250
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,753
Tell her.

251
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,805
You're beautiful.

252
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,624
Now say, "I'll never leave you."

253
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,394
I'll... I'll never leave you.

254
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,846
I'll be your mother...

255
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:18,983
until you die.

256
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,352
Tell her.

257
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,604
I'll be your mother

258
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,823
until the day you die.

259
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:29,860
Tell her again.

260
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,479
I'll be your mother

261
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,815
until you die.

262
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:51,832
(gasps, baby cries quietly)

263
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,217
What's happening?

264
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,668
She's breathing!

265
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,004
(baby cries)

266
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,056
(laughs)
She's breathing!

267
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:03,277
(woman cries,
baby cries)

268
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,646
(cries echoing)

269
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:15,861
LUKE (groans):
No.

270
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:18,580
(Luke gasps)

271
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:21,116
(growling, Nan screams,
Luke whimpers)

272
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,984
(guttural breathing)

273
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:25,954
(Nan screams)

274
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,172
(loud clanging)

275
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,491
Hey! Get away from there!

276
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,093
Over here, you rotting
pieces of shit!

277
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,627
Come on! Come on!

278
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:34,179
That's it. Come on, yeah.

279
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:37,516
Come on, come to mama.
(low growling)

280
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,684
(loud growling)

281
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,803
Oh, shit!
(loud growling)

282
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:43,805
(yells)

283
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,558
(low growling continues)

284
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:54,316
(loud thudding on door)

285
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:59,037
(loud rattling
and thudding on door)

286
00:16:59,122 --> 00:17:00,122
LaLAURIE:
You're not fine,

287
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,720
and you're my responsibility.
You never should have been

288
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,538
allowed out of this
bed. You! Butler!

289
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:08,891
See she stays put.
I'm going downstairs

290
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,576
and get some ice.
And get me a Coke!

291
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,947
(door closes)

292
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,236
(scratching sound)

293
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,637
Who's there?

294
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:53,936
Borquita!

295
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:58,374
Oh.

296
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,827
(gasps)

297
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:02,829
My daughter!

298
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,497
(gasps)

299
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:06,799
My child.

300
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,171
(sighs)

301
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:14,457
Oh.

302
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:21,147
Borquita.

303
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:23,316
(low, raspy breathing)

304
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:27,687
What has she done to you?

305
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:30,022
No.

306
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:35,144
What have <i>I</i> done to you?

307
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:38,614
(raspy breathing)

308
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:40,583
Borquita,

309
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,753
there must be... something

310
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,872
still inside you

311
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:49,459
that... that...
knows the mother

312
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,512
who bore you.

313
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:56,215
Come back to me, child.

314
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,217
I would make amends.

315
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,690
Borquita.

316
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,277
You <i>do</i> know me.

317
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,563
(growling)
(groans)

318

(loud rattling
and squeaking)

322
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:37,840
QUEENIE: She should
have been back already.

323
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:41,894
Go see what's keeping her?

324
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:48,217
(door opens)

325
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:55,775
(blow lands, male groan,
thudding)

326
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:58,611
Spalding?

327
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:02,031
What is that?

328
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:03,533
Spalding?!

329
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:05,568
(Spalding gasping)

330
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,788
(whimpering)

331
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:11,757
Oh, shit.
(growls)

332
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,796

340
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:00,840
(LaLaurie and Queenie panting)

341
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:05,461
Holy shit, you killed it.

342
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:12,268
She had a monster for a mother.

343
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:18,641
This last act...

344
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:22,578
was the only kindness
I ever did for her.

345
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:23,812
(sighs)

346
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:28,618
(sobbing)

347
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:35,374
(sobbing)

348
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,963
I think I'm bleeding out.

349
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:42,164
I won't let you.

350
00:21:50,223 --> 00:21:51,641
(grunts)

351
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:54,176
(zombies groaning)

352
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,315
(both grunting)

353
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:06,539
(screams)

354
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:12,662
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:16,532
(chain saw revving)

356
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,838
Get him inside, go!

357
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:37,553
♪

358
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,961
(chain saw motor dies)

359
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:14,923
(groans)

360
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:20,763
Be in your nature.

361
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:26,619
(grunts)

362
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:27,570
Oh...
Shit.

363
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:30,956
(gasps)
(grunts)

364
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:36,295
I don't know what that was,

365
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,132
but they got some real power
in that witch house now.

366
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,083
(groans)

367
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,673
(panting sharply)

368
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:58,300
Well, look
who finally showed up.

369
00:23:58,351 --> 00:23:59,902
I've been driving all night
from Lake Charles.

370
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:01,353
It's a four-hour drive...

371
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,989
I don't have
to defend myself to you.

372
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:06,275
Why don't you go sleep it off?

373
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:07,943
I'm here now.

374
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:09,612
You can stop pretending
you actually care about her.

375
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:14,149
Now, I may not have been the
mother she needed me to be,

376
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:17,620
but I can smell the
bullshit in your pockets

377
00:24:17,671 --> 00:24:19,755
even if she can't.

378
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:21,824
I begged her not to marry you.

379
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,843
You're a loser, running around

380
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:26,762
your whole life chasing
after penny jobs, huh?

381
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,347
You're one step up from the men

382
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:30,499
who stand in front
of Home Depot.

383
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,268
At least I come home to her.

384
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:34,220
I've never just abandoned her.

385
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,056
'Cause you know she is
the best you'll ever have.

386
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,108
Thank Christ you
couldn't knock her up.

387
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:41,343
Can you imagine her
with an infant now

388
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,145
after you run off
because you can't take

389
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:44,647
the pressures of a blind wife?

390
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,952
Permanently?

391
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:54,206
Oh, boy, here come
the crocodile tears.

392
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,576
No, Fiona, no,
you will not do this to us.

393
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:58,711
She hates you.

394
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,746
You hear that,
you piece of shit?

395
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,197
I love her and she knows it.

396
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:03,382
You are the one
that doesn't belong here.

397
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,800
You are the one
that needs to go away!

398
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:06,869
NURSE:
I don't care who it is,

399
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,304
but one of you is leaving

400
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:10,089
or I'm calling security.

401
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,178
You have 15 minutes with her,

402
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:18,764
and then I'll be back and you

403
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:20,766
will disappear.

404
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,486
You can go on your own

405
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:25,187
or my way.

406
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:26,722
I don't care which.

407
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,743
Although I'd prefer the latter.

408
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:51,747
I'm here, baby.

409
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:54,266
Can you feel me?

410
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:57,353
I don't care
what they did to you.

411
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,674
I promise

412
00:25:58,794 --> 00:26:00,723
I'm never going away.

413
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:02,975
I love you so much.

414
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:07,813
(gasps)

415
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:08,781
(Kaylee gasping)

416
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:32,257
Fire purges and purifies,

417
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:34,917
scatters our enemies
to the wind.

418
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:36,168
What blows away

419
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:38,036
need not be explained.

420
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:42,174
Okay, I think that's
the last of them.

421
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:44,576
This is nasty.

422
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:46,512
Maybe we should get
more cedar chips

423
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,881
to mask the smell.

424
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,304
How's Luke?

425
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:57,139
Still asleep in my bed.

426
00:26:57,223 --> 00:26:58,690
We have to get him
out of the house.

427
00:26:58,758 --> 00:26:59,925
He's not well enough yet.

428
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:01,059
Well, he can't stay here.

429
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,728
He can and he will.

430
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:04,947
No sense rushing him back

431
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:07,733
to his Holy Roller mother
till he recovers.

432
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:09,401
She'd only call the cops anyhow.

433
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,955
Thank you.

434
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,206
I like a witch

435
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:15,240
who knows how to fight.

436
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,325
You've done this coven

437
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:17,326
a great service, Zoe,

438
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,544
I won't forget it.

439
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:19,828
Go on.

440
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:45,520
Those are my daughters.

441
00:27:47,657 --> 00:27:49,608
The day they were born,

442
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:53,612
I sent such hopes
and dreams to heaven.

443
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:55,781
This is how it ends--

444
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:58,667
in flames and decay.

445
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:03,088
They deserved a better mother
than I could ever hope to be.

446
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:05,540
Yes...

447
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,459
I know the feeling.

448
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:13,632
Perhaps our shared
tragedies will...

449
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:16,134
bring us closer together.

450
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:19,354
I doubt it.

451
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,390
You are, after all, the maid.

452
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:28,847
Time to deal with the rest
of the trash, I see.

453
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:35,737
PEMBROKE:
<i>Fiona Goode,</i>

454
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:39,041
you stand before this council
accused of gross neglect,

455
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,126
malfeasance, and a
willful disregard

456
00:28:41,193 --> 00:28:42,661
for the well-being
of this coven.

457
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:45,697
Since you arrived here, this
house has been under attack

458
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:48,050
from outside forces.

459
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:49,868
A young witch remains missing.

460
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,536
The headmistress of this
academy-- your own daughter--

461
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,388
lies blinded in a hospital.

462
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,007
Given the seriousness
of these events

463
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:57,259
and after careful
consideration,

464
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:59,210
it is the grim duty
of this council

465
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:00,262
to demand your immediate,

466
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:02,264
unconditional abdication

467
00:29:02,348 --> 00:29:03,432
as Supreme of this coven.

468
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:05,183
It's nothing personal.

469
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:08,270
And given that the new Supreme

470
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:10,405
has not shown herself yet?

471
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,240
Until such time,
the coven shall fall

472
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,159
under the stewardship
of this council.

473
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:16,244
How convenient.

474
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,330
She couldn't inherit

475
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:20,415
the Supremacy,

476
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:23,401
so she has enlisted her lapdogs

477
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:24,536
to help steal it.

478
00:29:24,587 --> 00:29:25,704
I beg your pardon.

479
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,373
Oh, yes, you will beg,

480
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:31,076
but you will not be pardoned,

481
00:29:31,127 --> 00:29:33,845
Myrtle Snow,
not for what you have done.

482
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:36,214
What does she mean?

483
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:37,632
It's a trick, a gambit.

484
00:29:37,717 --> 00:29:39,601
She's desperate.

485
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:40,602
Well, it's not going to work,

486
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:42,270
not this time.

487
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:44,606
This council's decision
is unanimous and final.

488
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:46,058
We will not sit here
and listen to...

489
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:47,392
You will sit!

490
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:51,229
Oh.

491
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,114
And you will listen.

492
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:58,620
Now, it's true

493
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:01,990
this coven has been under
attack but not from outside--

494
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:04,793
from inside.

495
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:08,246
Our enemy hides in plain sight.

496
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:15,453
<i>Walks freely among us unseen.</i>

497
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:20,592
Our enemy has a face
and I have seen this face.

498
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:24,462
<i>This face has a name.</i>

499
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:27,766
Myrtle Snow.

500
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:29,768
Outrageous lies.

501
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:32,521
Did you think that
by destroying my daughter,

502
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,139
you could destroy me?

503
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,993
How dare you accuse me
of attacking Cordelia?

504
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,277
I've been more of a
mother to that girl

505
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:40,195
than you have ever been.

506
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,115
You latched on to my daughter

507
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,984
the minute I passed her
into your care

508
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:48,086
because you could
never have one.

509
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:52,257
I never had children because I
dedicated my life to this coven.

510
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:53,625
The love you had

511
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:55,260
for this coven and my daughter

512
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:56,628
has been eclipsed

513
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,597
by the hatred you have of me.

514
00:30:58,664 --> 00:30:59,848
Will you listen to her?

515
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:01,332
Next she'll be accusing
me of murdering

516
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:02,500
Madison Montgomery.

517
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:05,003
Well, you were here
in New Orleans--

518
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:06,805
at the time
of her disappearance, I mean.

519
00:31:06,856 --> 00:31:08,190
What is she talking about?

520
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:11,443
I told you,
she's trying to confuse you.

521
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,195
You weren't already
in town when Madison

522
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,896
went missing, were you?

523
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:16,342
Surely you would
have told us that.

524
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:18,900
Who is Jennifer Wooley?

525
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:20,869
MYRTLE:
<i>I'm sure I don't know.</i>

526
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,154
QUENTIN:
<i>Jennifer Wooley</i>

527
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:23,872
<i>is the Veronica Lake character</i>

528
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:27,542
<i>in the movie</i> I Married a Witch.

529
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:30,128
FIONA:
<i>Jennifer Wooley also happens</i>

530
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:32,464
<i>to be the witless alias</i>

531
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:35,717
<i>Myrtle used as a resident</i>
<i>at the Chat Noire Motel.</i>

532
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:45,510
<i>She has been here</i>
<i>all these weeks.</i>

533
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:47,012
<i>Planning this coup.</i>

534
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:51,850
She's twisting everything!

535
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:53,551
So, it's true?

536
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:55,487
You've been leaving here
under a false name?

537
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:57,105
She had to be stopped!

538
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,030
Is that a confession?

539
00:31:58,057 --> 00:31:59,557
What? No!

540
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:00,742
I confess to nothing!

541
00:32:00,827 --> 00:32:02,327
I don't need a confession.

542
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:04,996
You have been caught red-handed.

543
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:07,165
You're hurting me!
I'll do more than hurt you!

544
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:10,235
I will have justice.

545
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:14,039
The same acid that disfigured
my daughter did this.

546
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,242
Myrtle Snow...

547
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:18,743
have you anything to say

548
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:19,911
in your own defense?

549
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:22,547
You know what she is.

550
00:32:22,598 --> 00:32:23,632
Who would you believe?

551
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:24,766
You give us no choice.

552
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:29,387
Burn the witch.

553
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:31,773
Seconded.

554
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:35,193
The decision of this council

555
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:36,945
is unanimous and final.

556
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,568
No need to bind me.

557
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:45,871
I shall not resist.

558
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,322
Why would I?

559
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:48,874
I've been swimming
against the tide

560
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:50,608
my whole life.

561
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,994
Look where it got me.

562
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,714
I'm used to being an outcast.

563
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:57,582
The freak.

564
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:00,168
Until I found my place
in this coven.

565
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,837
I thought I'd come home.

566
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:03,972
But I was wrong.

567
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:09,811
I go proudly to the flame.

568
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:12,964
Go ahead.

569
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:16,301
Burn me.

570
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,438
("Right Place Wrong Time"
by Dr. John playing)

571
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,653
This is just a joke, right?

572
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,756
We're not actually burning her.

573
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,959

601

Any last words?

602
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:56,668
You're all a bunch
of little toads in a pot

603
00:34:56,735 --> 00:35:00,588
that Fiona is slowly
bringing to a boil.

604
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:03,375
You won't even feel it
until it's too late.

605
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:07,245
I'd rather burn than boil.

606
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,386
(screaming)

607
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:28,233
(screaming stops)

608
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:02,843
(knocking)

609
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:05,946
Come in.

610
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:07,867
Queenie, well,
what can I do for you?

611
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:12,319
You can answer me a question.

612
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,154
Yes?

613
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:19,159
Today...

614
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,377
Did I help you frame

615
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:23,780
a guilty woman or
an innocent one?

616
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,663
MYRTLE: <i>She's been leading
this coven to extinction!</i>

617
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:26,530
We've all said it!

618
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,595
She had to be stopped!

619
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:28,863
Is that a confession?

620
00:36:28,914 --> 00:36:30,715
What? No!
I confess to nothing!

621
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,866
FIONA:
You don't need to confess.

622
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,718
You've been caught
red-handed.

623
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:35,003
MYRTLE:
You're hurting me!

624
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:36,588
FIONA:
I'll do more than hurt you!

625
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:39,174
I will have justice!

626
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:41,343
The same acid that disfigured

627
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:43,544
my daughter did this!

628
00:36:43,596 --> 00:36:45,263
None of us are innocent,

629
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:46,731
No one.

630
00:36:49,385 --> 00:36:50,935
Look.

631
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,438
When you came to me,
I figure I owed you one

632
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:56,274
'cause you... you saved my life.

633
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:59,611
But I thought we were going
to oust her, not roast her.

634
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:02,330
And now I can't...
I can't close my eyes

635
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:03,748
without seeing
her burning body.

636
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,667
And the-the smell won't

637
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:09,204
leave my nose, I just...

638
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:12,207
I don't think I can do it.

639
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:14,259
Sit down.

640
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:18,713
Do what, Queenie?

641
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,885
Live with this.

642
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:26,254
Now, Queenie.

643
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:29,891
I can already sense

644
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:31,426
a change in you.

645
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:33,761
Your mind is getting stronger.

646
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:37,315
You've taken
an important first step.

647
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,734
A necessary first step

648
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:41,069
to fulfill your promise.

649
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,822
And under my tutelage,

650
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:45,290
my mentorship,

651
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:47,942
well, you could rise to heights

652
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:50,245
that you dare not even imagine.

653
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:52,380
(short laugh)

654
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:54,049
Even as high

655
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:56,451
as the next Supreme.

656
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:58,953
(short laugh)

657
00:37:59,004 --> 00:38:00,889
Me?

658
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:02,623
The Supreme?

659
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:05,510
Well, why not? I mean...

660
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:07,562
maybe that's what
this coven needs.

661
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:09,764
A Supreme of...

662
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,900
color.

663
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,485
Yeah.

664
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:15,687
Why not me, right?

665
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,772
I'm as much witch as any of these others.
More.

666
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:20,191
And I am feeling stronger.

667
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:23,578
More powerful.
Of course you are.

668
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:25,613
Yes.

669
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:27,665
You have to trust me.

670
