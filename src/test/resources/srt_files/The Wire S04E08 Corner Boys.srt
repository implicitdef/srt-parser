1
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:12,241
So, Rashad has 82 apples...

2
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:16,476
and 12 friends...

3
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,144
all of whom are hungry.

4
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,915
And so he looks
carefully at his apples

5
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,480
and sees
that seven have worms.

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,516
Another 15 have gone rotten.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,891
But he wants to be fair

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,159
and distribute all
the good apples equally.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,063
"Distribute"?

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,397
Give out.

11
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,632
Well, just say that, yo?

12
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,968
Okay.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,916
Okay, so how many apples
does each of Rashad's friends get:

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,477
A, 4; B, 5;

15
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,082
C, 6; or D, 7?

16
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,751
Take your time,
but do it fast.

17
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,354
Hey. Nigger said,
"l got my rights,"

18
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,956
so my boy said,
"Oh, yeah?

19
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,092
Well, he's got a left
to go with your right. "

20
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,260
He was like, pow!

21
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,739
- Calvin, you are done already?
- Uh-huh.

22
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,606
- Yeah?
- B, 5.

23
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,509
How did you work
that out so fast?

24
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,174
Easy.
"B, 5" got the dinks.

25
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,343
- The what?
- If you want, I could show you.

26
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,717
Don't show him,
show me.

27
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,086
All right.

28
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,918
You did this with
the earlier math class, right?

29
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,829
So, you, like,
got 82 apples...

30
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,629
12 niggers...

31
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,659
and then how many
blah, blah, blah--

32
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,897
then you went, like,

33
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,372
dinking all round this one
and no other one.

34
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,739
So, answer is "B, 5."

35
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,902
Everybody get that?

36
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,138
Yeah.

37
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,646
"B, 5,"
it got all the dinks.

38
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,481
"B, 5,"
I'm an Audi 5000.

39
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,187
The priority should
be on making sure

40
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,215
the age files are up to date
with all notes transcribed,

41
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,319
the standard office report.

42
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,057
Uh...

43
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,032
on our day shift today,
you may encounter

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,731
Councilman and Democratic
mayoral nominee Thomas Carcetti,

45
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:02,229
who's been fact-finding
within the department.

46
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,539
So, if you go
leaving your fax

47
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,276
Iying around and he finds them,
that shit's on you.

48
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,010
Lastly...

49
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,883
as most of you
are already aware,

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,889
our ClD Commander
Raymond Foerster,

51
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,550
after a long bout
with cancer,

52
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,526
passed away last night
at Johns Hopkins.

53
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,358
Ahem.

54
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,098
Better eulogies are coming.

55
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,328
So, let me just say

56
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,998
that the man
served 39 years--

57
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,633
attaining the rank
of colonel--

58
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,408
without leaving a trail
of bitterness or betrayal.

59
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,439
In this department,
that's not a career, it's a miracle.

60
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,114
There'll be a detective's
wake this evening

61
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,589
followed by viewings
on Wednesday

62
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,390
and a burial mass on Friday.

63
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,692
The family suggests donations

64
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,891
to the colonel's
favorite charities.

65
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,332
The addresses will be posted
in the coffee room.

66
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,962
All told.

67
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,666
And, Bunk, I just got
your overtime for the week.

68
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,766
Get down to my office
and pull your pants down.

69
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,643
Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,220
No no no!
Fuck that.

71
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,631
You've finished your pot,
you make the next one.

72
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,726
Okay.

73
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,004
I don't see the right
one in here anyway.

74
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,312
- Sergeant Hauk.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,476
I just got off
with Beauford at lAD.

76
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,111
He tells me there's a harassment
complaint been filed.

77
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,053
Some Jamaican woman
says you had her stopped

78
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,785
and searched
by Amtrak police.

79
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,816
Yeah. Well, you see,
in my report,

80
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,055
we had what we thought
was reliable info

81
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,327
that she was a drug courier
for Marlo Stanfield.

82
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,460
I mean, we actually scoped
Stanfield with her.

83
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,437
What was the info?

84
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,906
The Cl's been reliable.

85
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,102
Great track record
with us.

86
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,610
Long history.

87
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,909
Cl 238.
Give me his name.

88
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,542
His name? Sir.

89
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,881
Sir!

90
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,409
I've never been comfortable
with, you know,

91
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,946
tossing around names
of informants in squad rooms.

92
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,980
I feel that it's--

93
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,653
- Name.
- Fuzzy Dunlop, sir.

94
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,756
I might have to set up a meeting
with this character.

95
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,631
He's kind of leery of meets.

96
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,363
He's been reliable,
I promise you.

97
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,895
I mean, this one baffled
the shit out of me, too.

98
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,033
But he's never
been off, never.

99
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,170
You jumped out
on bad information, Sergeant.

100
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,009
You brought in
another agency,

101
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,072
and you brought
discredit to this unit--

102
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,947
my unit.

103
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,885
In good faith though, sir.

104
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,514
Anything comes of this,

105
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,750
I have your report,

106
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,691
and I will bury you with it.

107
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,898
And in case
you haven't been

108
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,163
paying attention
to the election results,

109
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,069
your rabbi has
left the building.

110
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,611
- No tantrums today?
- What's the point?

111
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,706
They're not even gonna
suspend us, right?

112
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,979
Right.
What's the point?

113
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,078
So, we're here,
like it or not.

114
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,554
If it makes you all
feel any better,

115
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,954
the word around school is

116
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,855
you're down here because
you beat the system.

117
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,860
You had no interest
in being in a classroom,

118
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,624
and you made the classroom
impossible for everybody else,

119
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,791
and now you are out.
You won.

120
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,269
- Ha ha. Yeah!
- You feel like winners?

121
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,237
- Always.
- That's how we did.

122
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,432
Who's we?

123
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,942
- Us.
- No, who are you?

124
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,069
- Players.
- Kingpins?

125
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,976
Nah, that comes later.

126
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,640
Right now, we are
just corner boys.

127
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,707
So, how long until
you are kingpins?

128
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,116
I am thinking
two, three years.

129
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,122
Two, three years.

130
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,556
Let me ask, and I want everybody
to write this down--

131
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,720
where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

132
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,394
Come on,
pencil and paper.

133
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,456
This isn't schoolwork,
this is about y'all.

134
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,461
She's young
but she's good.

135
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,234
Yeah, a doctoral candidate
from the psych department

136
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,831
of College Park.

137
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,834
Thesis work is on social
alienation and analysis.

138
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,574
All right, show of hands,

139
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,081
how many wrote "NBA"?

140
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,606
Yeah, but only
for the Lakers though.

141
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,585
I want to be
a pediatric neurosurgeon

142
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,918
Iike that one nigga,
what's his name?

143
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,082
- Ben Carson.
- Yeah, that dude.

144
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,853
He's a black surgeon at Hopkins
with a lot of profile.

145
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,952
You want to be a surgeon,
you need to go to medical school.

146
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,520
Whatever.

147
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,156
How many wrote
down "dead"?

148
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,633
Shit, you saw
that coming, huh?

149
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,226
It's a shame
you all have so little time,

150
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,828
and you're wasting it
here with us.

151
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,805
You know where
you're going.

152
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,035
We can't teach you anything
you don't know about that, right?

153
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,133
That's what
we've been saying.

154
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,371
Namond,
put away the magazine.

155
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,243
I ain't reading
no magazine.

156
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,010
- Namond.
- What?

157
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,607
It ain't even mine.

158
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,676
It was laying here
when I came in.

159
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,949
Y'all little pissers.

160
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,492
You know, we are giving
them a fine education.

161
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,120
"lt ain't even mine.

162
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,563
It was just laying here
when I came in."

163
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,998
You know
this right here--

164
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,592
the whole damn school--

165
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,466
the way they carry themselves,

166
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,132
it's training
for the street.

167
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,903
The building's the system,
we the cops.

168
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,774
Yeah, you are for sure.

169
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,109
I mean, you'll come
in here every day

170
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,944
and practice getting over,

171
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,847
try running all
different kinds of games.

172
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,875
You know, it's practice
for the corner, right?

173
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,854
Ain't no real cops.
Ain't no real danger.

174
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,357
But you'll all getting
something out of this.

175
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,120
Bet you didn't
even know that.

176
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,186
Still I'd rather
be out there.

177
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,721
Can l?
Corner boys, huh?

178
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,324
Let me ask
y'all something.

179
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,995
You know, you help us
hone in on this,

180
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,266
and maybe we do
a little better job with you in here.

181
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,273
- What makes a good corner boy?
- Keep your eyes open.

182
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,332
- Keep the count straight.
- Don't trust nobody.

183
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,949
If you stupid in the hood,
you get killed.

184
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,646
That's the only way.

185
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,447
And I am telling you,

186
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,753
this name in black right
here got stink on it.

187
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,985
Eyeball witness, Bunk.

188
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,789
Vernon, at least go back
to the scene with me

189
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,490
- and take a fresh look.
- You're out of line here, Bunk.

190
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,554
You are.

191
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,465
A lot of names.
Too many.

192
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,696
No, we're good with it.

193
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,286
Listen, you back-seat-
driving motherfucker,

194
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,189
the guy picked him out--
Omar-fucking-Little.

195
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,159
Why he picked him out?
Who the fuck cares?

196
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,457
We got a dead female
taxpayer on our hands,

197
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,691
- and somebody's saying him.
- I don't buy.

198
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,790
And look who you talking about.
This ain't the motherfucker

199
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,131
that came up with
62 ways for the peanut.

200
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,536
His name pops up on five
or six cases I know of--

201
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,507
including two of yours-- and you want
to put him back on the street?

202
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,305
But this ain't him.

203
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,278
That means someone else
is walking on you all.

204
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,643
Let me tell you
something, Bunk:

205
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,046
the next body you catch,

206
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,141
I'm going to be
crawling all over it,

207
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,152
second-guessing
your ass every step,

208
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,644
pulling on every last
motherfucking thread.

209
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,523
Yeah. We going to see
how you like it.

210
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,523
Hey, Vernon.

211
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,760
Vernon, Vernon,
Vernon, Vernon.

212
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,735
- Just go back on it with me.
- What?

213
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,602
Shit doesn't play out
any differently...

214
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,107
I'll give you a back rub that
you ain't never going to forget.

215
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,108
Ahem.

216
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,289
You know, you guys don't
need to do anything

217
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,557
you wouldn't normally do
just 'cause I'm here.

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,027
I wouldn't know what we
normally do around here.

219
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,837
I'm new
and inexperienced.

220
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,572
Oh, you're...

221
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,240
Yeah. I am.

222
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,374
Seriously, I'm just
trying to get a feel

223
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,715
for the department's
response to the violence.

224
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,812
I'm not the hall monitor
or anything.

225
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,744
So, this is your day?

226
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,515
We catch a body,
it's different.

227
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,818
Mmm!

228
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,079
I believe
you got my camera?

229
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,344
- I what?
- License and registration.

230
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,819
You do me one,
I'll do you.

231
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,286
You got a card
or something?

232
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,059
City, huh?

233
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,429
Video camera
gotta come back.

234
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,163
Yeah, well, I see what
I can find out about it.

235
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,933
But you know cameras--

236
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,735
kind of like pigeons
in the storm.

237
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,208
You know
what I'm saying?

238
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,234
Sometimes they come back.
Sometimes...

239
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,108
But I keep an ear
out on it.

240
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,219
Hey, Jim,
he just say pigeons?

241
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,622
He's fucking with you.

242
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,023
Look, you just got
to tell Marimow

243
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,358
that you used the camera
for the PC at the train station.

244
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,192
And then just admit
the camera got took.

245
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,222
I already put it
down to the Cl.

246
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,393
I tell dickhead the truth,

247
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,165
- he takes my stripes on it.
- Oh, come on.

248
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,298
Look, I'm just saying
you weren't suspended that long.

249
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,502
Is it because
Tiff dropped it,

250
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,568
or because you had to do
something for Miss Donnelly?

251
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,080
- Do something?
- I don't know,

252
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,548
Iike promise or something.

253
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,016
No, Tiff dropped it,
so it's dropped.

254
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,951
Ain't nothing past that.

255
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,047
That's good. You know,
the thing with the teachers

256
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,388
and cops and whatnot,
they always come at you

257
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,723
Iike think they got you
by the ass.

258
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,228
But you keep
your mouth shut,

259
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,663
ain't nothing
they could do.

260
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,428
So, more times than not,
they go away.

261
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,867
Word on that.

262
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,632
I mean, it don't even matter.
And Miss Anna...

263
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,573
she got me on this
short leash right now.

264
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,510
Can't go out the house unless
she know right where I'm going.

265
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,740
Shit, at least
you've got a leash.

266
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,987
Dewey!

267
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,320
What the fuck is that?

268
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,791
Club soda...

269
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,657
and lime.

270
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,628
Omissive bitch.

271
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,723
Why not just suck a dick
and get it over with?

272
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,168
That will get the bad
taste out of your mouth.

273
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,604
Ah.

274
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,765
Yeah.

275
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,564
Almost new.

276
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,540
Don't wear
no dead man's hat.

277
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,940
I'm just fuckin'
with you.

278
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,410
Here, let's pray.

279
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,778
Here we lay a couple
of New York boys

280
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,546
who came too far south
for their own fuckin' good.

281
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,112
Fucking Yankee proud of it now,
you fuckin' bitches.

282
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,024
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

283
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,425
You hungry?

284
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,301
You want some Chinese?

285
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,468
No talking.

286
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,771
Keep your eyes
on your paper.

287
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,184
Yo, Mr. Prezbo,
this say "cars."

288
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,690
- So?
- All the stuff we did in practice

289
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,157
was about food.

290
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,718
It's okay. It's just
a different object.

291
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,662
Pay attention
to the number.

292
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,028
Numbers are
messed up, too.

293
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,589
We never did one-thirds.

294
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,830
It's the same operation--
1/4, 1/5, 1/3.

295
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,304
Follow the same steps.
It's just a different denominator.

296
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,534
How do you get
1/3 of a car?

297
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,736
It's actually
1/3 of all the cars.

298
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,802
Was I talking to you?!

299
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,118
You get close enough...

300
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,919
you could take
a headshot. Why?

301
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,985
'Cause maybe
he vested up.

302
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,258
Word. A chest shot
maybe won't do it for you.

303
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,297
Then what? You.

304
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,395
- It's his turn.
- Thug, you on it.

305
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,736
You gotta shoot
from a distance,

306
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,365
you can't risk
a headshot.

307
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,935
You go for the belly,
the dick or the ass area.

308
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,972
Because the vest don't
go down that far.

309
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,450
Bam! Take them out.

310
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,079
- Then what?
- Walk up,

311
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,715
- finish them off.
- With a...?

312
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,850
Headshot.

313
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,623
Damn, y'all coming
along full effect.

314
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,721
I hear it--
I hear that.

315
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,128
All right,
now say he in a car.

316
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,538
Sergeant Thomas Hauk,
Baltimore City Police.

317
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,768
Didn't I say City
would come running?

318
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,936
- Did.
- I'll check this joker out for you.

319
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,208
See what's what.

320
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,272
One other thing,

321
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,840
you're are doing
okay running them

322
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,682
New York niggers
of off East Side. I know that.

323
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,951
But this thing you got
with disappearing the bodies...

324
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,517
My man is saying if you just
vanishing the bodies like that,

325
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,826
it do kind of defeats
its own purpose.

326
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,661
Niggers don't know
if they went back

327
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,190
to the Bronx
or whatever.

328
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,669
- You feel me?
- Of course.

329
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,228
I'll tell my people.

330
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,207
Hey, no disrespect to your
professionalism or nothing.

331
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,800
We all impressed how you

332
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,004
Iose the motherfuckers
like that.

333
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,240
We just trying
to send a message

334
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,614
to these New York people
in full effect...

335
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,710
you know
what I'm saying?

336
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,311
I'll get back
to you on this.

337
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,497
So, Councilman,

338
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,563
I understand you were
a ClD yesterday.

339
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,302
See anything big
with those downtown boys?

340
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,139
Well, they messed up
the lunch order.

341
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,405
No, I figured
I needed to get closer

342
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,003
to the street, so that's
why I am out here today.

343
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,071
Rolling with the mighty
is east of the east.

344
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,811
Now, remember, we had
a shooting incident last week.

345
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,684
So, keep those corner fucks
to one window. Don't get surrounded.

346
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,746
Shit, remember we had
a van full of you guys,

347
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,814
- we'd find the fucking chap.
- What the fuck you say?

348
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,758
Dressed like that,
Stevie Wonder make you as police.

349
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,626
Keep your radio out of sight.
Volume up on those boom boxes.

350
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,688
10 bucks say
we collar up first.

351
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,199
20 makes
it worth our while.

352
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,360
Mr. Mayor, you know what's great
about the Easter?

353
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,869
We are hungry motherfuckers--

354
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,302
respectfully, I mean.

355
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,965
So, you're saying,

356
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,067
you don't ever give
anybody a break?

357
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,907
- Anybody?
- Nah nah.

358
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,879
'cause if you let him
slide for a dollar,

359
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,346
it's a sign
that you're weak.

360
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,940
Today's dollar
is tomorrow's two.

361
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,383
Yeah, same with your crew.
Your boy come up short

362
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,478
saying spillage
or police or whatever,

363
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,388
you let him be, and then
he gettin' over on you.

364
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,654
- Then you a chump.
- So, you got to fuck him up.

365
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,719
- Yeah.
- You gotta, ahem, mess him up.

366
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,823
Nah nah. Something for real
happen, you do that.

367
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,424
If you do it over
some bullshit,

368
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,367
then all you did
was lose a good worker.

369
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,597
Oh, no.

370
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,470
Man, you gotta fuck
that nigger up, man.

371
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,276
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

372
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,215
Whoa!

373
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,048
Stop talking
on top of each other.

374
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,486
This how you communicate
out on them streets?

375
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,958
All right, it's like this:
you boy come back to you,

376
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,859
- say this happened, that happened--
- Then you fuck him up.

377
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,921
In my mind, I'm gonna let him
make it out of his own cut, too.

378
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,125
If he good worker,
he know what he need to do.

379
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,998
Yeah, he got a point.

380
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:20,368
He got a point.
That's a good one.

381
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,770
If he thinks about it,

382
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,297
says it ain't his fault,

383
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,207
then that nigger
run a game on you.

384
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,938
And then you fuck
that nigger up.

385
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,106
- Yeah.
- All right, yeah.

386
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,844
- But why?
- You know it gotta happen, man.

387
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,818
You know
what I'm saying!

388
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,684
Wait wait wait!
One voice. One voice.

389
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,350
- Y'all, one voice.
- Yo, yo, D, you tell him.

390
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,086
There always
people watching.

391
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,320
Watching... you.

392
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,955
True. Yeah.

393
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,861
What's taking you boys
so long?

394
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,160
There he is now.

395
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,134
Hurry up,
hurry up, this guy.

396
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,500
This guy right here.

397
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,971
Fuck you, guys.
Hey, yo, yo.

398
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,439
Yo, man,
we need some pills.

399
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,204
Yeah, you in
the right place, man.

400
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,267
Get them for us.

401
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,142
Come on, man,
I'm going to work.

402
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,080
Yo, 20 for the pills
and 10 for you.

403
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,641
- Leave the bike.
- What, you want steal my bike?

404
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,811
What the fuck
I want your bike for?

405
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,844
I got a car.

406
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,753
Give me a minute.

407
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,220
$20 might not mean
nothing to you.

408
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,753
But I ain't making
that much money.

409
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,733
It's hard money.

410
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,167
Y'all some
lazy motherfuckers.

411
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,464
This shit is right
around the corner.

412
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,495
You have no idea how much
we appreciate this.

413
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,372
I love it when they come
to work pumped like this.

414
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,336
Shit.

415
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,349
Come on, man.
I'm going to work.

416
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,180
Come on, man.
I'm going to work, man!

417
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,344
It's bullshit, man!

418
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,013
This is some bullshit
right here.

419
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,887
For real! For real! I ain't got
no drugs, no shit on me.

420
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,688
I ain't got nothing on me, man.
And you taking my bike, too?!

421
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,662
I need that.

422
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,961
- One down.
-...comin' in the hood fuckin' with us.

423
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,434
This is fucked up
right here, man.

424
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:05,140
Andre, how you doing?

425
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,168
This is a friend of mine--
Detective Moreland.

426
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,737
Hey.

427
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,512
You doing okay there
or what?

428
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,146
So, listen, for my friend here,
tell me one more time

429
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,951
how the thing went down,
will you?

430
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,958
- The boy came in.
- Omar?

431
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,359
- Omar.
- He puts the nine on her.

432
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,387
Says to me,
"Whatever you got."

433
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,955
Mm-hmm.

434
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,695
A nine, huh?

435
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,362
Where were you?

436
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,498
- Where you see me at.
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,833
Nine wouldn't
go through this.

438
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,472
- Why did you come out?
- 'Cause he said to.

439
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,345
Trying to save her life.

440
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,815
Right, I'm saying---

441
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,752
This is like
Bank of England glass.

442
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,984
Fort Knox glass.

443
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,992
And who put that
up there? Huh?

444
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:59,258
Guy must have had
an elephant gun or some shit.

445
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,061
I don't know.
The boy had a mask on.

446
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,132
A mask, eh?

447
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,039
Like Zorro, huh?

448
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,908
- When did that happen?
- A few weeks back.

449
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,711
- Put in a report?
- It got away from me.

450
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,617
Mm-hmm.

451
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,417
Andre.

452
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,324
We're going to need you
to come down to the office

453
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,294
and straighten out
a couple of things.

454
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,993
I'm running
a business here.

455
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,624
I ain't going nowhere.

456
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,935
Give me a bottle
of Mylanta.

457
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,567
Please.

458
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,082
His whole story is fucked,
and here's why:

459
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,518
First, it don't
make any sense.

460
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,021
The shooter took
out the woman

461
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,649
and left him breathing
to talk to you.

462
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,090
He should be dead, too.

463
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,526
Second, there's
a drug depot in there.

464
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,653
Ah!

465
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,962
The glass,
reinforced steel,

466
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,594
camera, low inventory.

467
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,366
And, third,
he's shining us on

468
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,775
about that
big-ass.50-cal hole

469
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,902
because I know
who put it there,

470
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,378
and he knows
who put it there.

471
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,880
And if he were to say,

472
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,213
"Oh, that?
That's Omar's previous.

473
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,242
Ripping off
a re-up in here--"

474
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,880
which is what happened--
he be fucked.

475
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,116
So what?

476
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,591
A guy comes in
the first time

477
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,561
with a.50 caliber because
he knows the glass is thick,

478
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,190
then comes back
the next week with a nine?

479
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,969
The job isn't about picking
the stories we like best.

480
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:50,270
Motherfucker. Now you're going to
lecture me about what the job is.

481
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,573
- My apologies.
- Okay. Let's go downtown.

482
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,022
It's a new law, yo--

483
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,819
three pills,
that's felony weight.

484
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,019
And you're on
a pre-indicted corner?

485
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,824
- What?
- You better show some stash.

486
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,455
Oh, it's off
the chart now.

487
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,989
Those DC boys down there,
too, right.

488
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,696
They love fresh Baltimore ass.

489
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,500
- Mm-mmm.
- I ain't know no stash.

490
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,473
They say
it's better than pussy.

491
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,068
- Those my pills.
- Yeah.

492
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,512
Have you ever heard
of federal guidelines?

493
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,481
Pre-indicted corners,
homeboy.

494
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,508
That's three years mandatory.
Unless you mitigate.

495
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,248
- Mit-a-what?
- The stash, front boy.

496
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,192
I don't know no stash.
Those my pills, man.

497
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,162
I'm high
right now, look.

498
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,596
Yeah.

499
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,827
They gonna love him
up in there. Come on.

500
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,335
- I saw him first.
- Yeah?

501
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,667
- Bitch is mine.
- Those are my pills, I swear.

502
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,933
That's two.

503
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,337
Get the fuck in the car.

504
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,002
Damn, fractions?

505
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,308
He's doing fractions.

506
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,609
Shit, you want to know
what we talked about

507
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,081
in my new class today?

508
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,606
- What?
- Slinging.

509
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,050
Yo, I'm not playing.

510
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,485
We talked about business,

511
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,250
about putting shit
on the damn street.

512
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,278
Nigga, please.

513
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,018
It was like
we schooling them.

514
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,050
Yo, my new class
is the shit.

515
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,426
Yo, you going
by the gym today?

516
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,431
No, man.
I gotta go vial up

517
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,956
what's left on this package
so I can re-up.

518
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:23,990
All right.

519
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,627
- All right, man.
- Peace, man.

520
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,035
That shit is
easy though, right?

521
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,617
I got to leave soon,
Duquan.

522
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,347
Okay.

523
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,581
What level are you on?

524
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,883
12.

525
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,687
Ah, I never
made it past 10.

526
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,523
Want to see me
get to 40?

527
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,728
That's cheating.

528
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,427
Want me
to show you how?

529
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,241
Baltimore City
Police Department.

530
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,506
Yes, ma'am,
this is Sydney Handjerker

531
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,878
with Handjerker,
Cohen & Bromburg.

532
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,975
I'm trying to locate
a Sergeant Thomas Hauk

533
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,077
in regards to a client
I am representing.

534
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,315
Hold, please.

535
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,918
Mayor's office,
Lieutenant Hoskins.

536
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,553
Yes, hello.
This is Ervin Pepper

537
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,825
of Pepper, Pepper
& Bayleaf.

538
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,994
I'm calling in regards to a Sergeant
Thomas Hauk in regards to a--

539
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,094
He's no longer on this detail.
Hold on for a minute.

540
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,742
Major Crimes.
May I help you?

541
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:43,009
This is Dr. Jay calling with
test results for Thomas Hauk.

542
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,275
He's on the street.

543
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,146
You want to leave
a message?

544
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,118
Hello?

545
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,959
Let's do it.

546
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,520
You've just got to
walk up on him, all right?

547
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,225
Snap one.

548
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,598
We've gotta make sure
he's from New York first, right?

549
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,795
Gotta ask.

550
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,929
Ask what?
"You from New York?"

551
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,802
No, ask a Baltimore question,

552
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,603
something a New York
nigger won't know.

553
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,110
- What's a Baltimore question, yo?
- I don't know,

554
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,374
Iike, maybe something
about club music.

555
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,075
They don't know nothing
about that shit up in New York.

556
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,845
Huh?

557
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:23,320
Ask him, like,
who Young Leek be.

558
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,755
( quotes lyrics )

559
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,622
Or K-Swift.

560
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,359
Man, I know nothing about
that 92Q shit, man.

561
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,025
Man, who gives
a fuck, yo?

562
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,694
You don't know
Marc Clarke?

563
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,397
"The Big Phat
Morning Show"?

564
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,429
You ain't right, girl.

565
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,135
The average Baltimore nigga is gonna
know all that shit, all right?

566
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,406
They don't listen
to that shit up in New York.

567
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,174
They listen to some bullshit
up in New York.

568
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,909
- Go ahead.
- All right, whatever.

569
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,008
Hey, got a bet
going on, man.

570
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,019
- What's up?
- Who's your favorite one

571
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,816
on "The Big Phat
Morning Show," yo?

572
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,880
What, are you a New York, girl?
Sonjay.

573
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,357
- Who? Who?
- Kill that show any day.

574
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,622
Snoop! Snoop, yo!
Snoop, yo! Yo!

575
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,528
Chill! Sonjay be
on the show too.

576
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,098
So maybe I ask the questions
from now on, all right?

577
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,142
And then they basically entrap
some poor bastard on a bet,

578
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,442
haul in
$20 worth of drugs.

579
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,278
Now they've got to
process him, feed him,

580
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,408
property voucher his bike.

581
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,782
Next thing,
they're working on

582
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,151
some 14-year-old smoke hound
like he's Bin Laden.

583
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,554
The big haul there is
three vials of cocaine.

584
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,058
I mean,
are you with this?

585
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,084
I've been fighting
this bullshit for years.

586
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,823
The only way to go
is high-end enforcement.

587
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,331
You pick the targets
that'll make a dent out there,

588
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,890
reduce the violence.

589
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,526
So what's the problem?

590
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,332
Problem is
I do what I'm told.

591
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,929
Meaning?

592
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:53,103
Mr. Mayor, I'm no more
a racist than you are.

593
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,305
The thing about
affirmative action--

594
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,610
I'm just talking policy here,
no offense intended--

595
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,482
- None taken.
- --it's a numbers game.

596
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,544
And numbers games
breed more numbers games.

597
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,522
You need a 20% hike
in the hiring of black officers

598
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,490
to keep up with
the city demographic.

599
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,789
But that's also got to be reflected
straight up the chain,

600
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:13,524
which means fast-tracking
some people past where their--

601
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,395
how do I say this--

602
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,901
there are experienced warrants.

603
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,496
And he who owes his good fortune
to the numbers,

604
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,527
abides in them.

605
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,939
Gotta show arrests
are up 15, 20%.

606
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,103
We'll worry about
the quality later.

607
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,841
So what you saw out there,
it's a con game,

608
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,246
a Band-Aid on cancers.

609
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,809
So no, I'm not with this,
but I do follow orders.

610
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:39,118
However, if those
orders were to change,

611
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,490
or if I had the opportunity
to change them myself...

612
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,175
Oh no, you not!

613
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,938
What's this shit
doing in my house?

614
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,172
I stretching bottles, Ma.

615
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,372
You ever see your daddy

616
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,244
bring his work home
with him like that?

617
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,978
That's what you got
a lieutenant for.

618
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,543
Police come through this door
instead of your mother,

619
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,782
they will have
this whole damn house.

620
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,291
This has all got to be packed up
and elsewhere right now.

621
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,316
All right, be cool.

622
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,454
Wait till Bey
hears about this.

623
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,536
Did you hear that naked-ass appeal
to racial solidarity?

624
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,063
I'd like to kick his
pale entitled ass.

625
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,837
Were you listening?

626
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,401
He's no more
a racist than I am.

627
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,572
Might have to
kick your ass, too.

628
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,677
What have you heard
about this fellow Daniels?

629
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,153
Major in the Western.

630
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,985
Yeah, he's there,

631
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,958
but not much politically.

632
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,722
I don't think he's got
any suction with anybody.

633
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,832
Where's the Rice-A-Roni?

634
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,633
Ma, where's the Rice-A-Roni?

635
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,163
There was this
boy on the stoop

636
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,335
that looked like
he was starving.

637
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,571
So you cooked it
for him?

638
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,274
Naw, I just gave it
to him.

639
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,373
You just gave it
to him.

640
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,011
Boy ate a raw box
of Rice-A-Roni?

641
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,391
How much did you sell
the groceries for?

642
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,985
Don't look at me
like that.

643
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,120
I gotta go out.

644
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,938
- $10?
- You have your Rice-A-Roni profits.

645
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:45,073
Michael, come on!

646
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,017
Boy, I ain't gonna let
you hold the DSS card

647
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,213
if you ain't gonna
do right by me.

648
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,620
You're gonna let me
hold that card.

649
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,256
You're a hard child.

650
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,965
Next time, don't go selling
the food out of our mouths!

651
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,606
Yeah, like y'all say--

652
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,046
don't lie, don't bunk,

653
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,676
don't cheat, don't steal,
or whatever.

654
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,276
But what about y'all, huh?

655
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,288
What, the government?

656
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,153
What it-- Enron? Ha!

657
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,124
Steroids, yeah.

658
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,148
Liquor business?

659
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,320
Booze is the real killer
out there.

660
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,296
And cigarettes--
oh, shit.

661
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,061
Hey, you got
some smokes in there?

662
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,898
I'm trying to quit.

663
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,006
And drugs paid
your salary, right?

664
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,871
No, not exactly,
but I get your point.

665
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,706
We do the same thing
as y'all,

666
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,339
except when we do it, it's like,
"Oh my God, these kids is animals."

667
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,645
Like it's the end of
the world coming.

668
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,675
Man, that's bullshit,
all right?

669
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,781
'Cause it's like-- what is it--
hypocrite-- hypocritical.

670
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,348
I mean, yeah,
we got our thing,

671
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,723
but this is just part
of the big thing.

672
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,091
Exactly.

673
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,289
But this corner-boy
thing, right?

674
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,730
All y'all did all this
talking up in here.

675
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,233
You think
you could sit down

676
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,633
and write down
the laws to your thing?

677
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,296
Hell yeah.
I'll do it right now.

678
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,463
Shit.

679
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,574
No, I'm talking about--
can y'all do it together?

680
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,973
I give the test
on fractions,

681
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,007
half the kids
have breakdowns.

682
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:30,316
I still have a lot of kids who can
barely handle whole numbers.

683
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,821
Well, if it's any comfort,

684
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,622
I have outside
of my advanced class

685
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,754
maybe half a dozen
reading at grade level.

686
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,957
Try having them on
the periodic table of elements.

687
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,761
The thing is,
it's your curriculum,

688
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,199
and you have to
stick to it.

689
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,328
- I can't. It's absurd.
- You have to.

690
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,531
That test in April is
the difference between

691
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,905
the state taking over
the school or not.

692
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,534
Maybe the state should.

693
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:56,069
Look, you teach math,
you teach the test.

694
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,546
North Avenue
is all about

695
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,517
the leave-no-child-behind stuff
getting spoon-fed.

696
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,019
And what do they learn?

697
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,646
Find some middle ground.

698
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,715
Every day try to do
a little for the statewide,

699
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,454
and keep a unit problem on
the blackboard for Donnelly.

700
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,927
You know,
if she comes to visit,

701
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,328
she thinks
you're on point.

702
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,059
The rest of the time,

703
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,397
do what you feel like
you need to do.

704
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,868
But be careful.

705
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,428
You're are still on the far side
of your evaluation.

706
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,997
The first year
isn't about the kids,

707
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,134
it's about you surviving.

708
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,949
Whoo-hoo!

709
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,880
Get up!

710
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,913
Get up!

711
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,323
Hands on your head.

712
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,520
- I was eating that.
- Fuck you.

713
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,398
- That's my lunch.
- Fuck you.

714
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,232
Find a wall,
motherfuckers. Man.

715
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,668
Get your feet up.

716
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,470
- This is harassment.
- What did I say to you?

717
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:02,468
"Fuck you."
That's what you said to me.

718
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,174
There's nothing here,
man.

719
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,740
Oops. My bad.

720
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,445
You want to play
games with me?

721
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,716
I'm going to be in your people's shit
like this every day

722
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,313
until my camera
comes home.

723
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,621
You hear me?
Every day.

724
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,527
You and yours.
Let's go.

725
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,229
Ah, that felt good!

726
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,826
The old Western DEU
rides again.

727
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,897
Yes?

728
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,068
Anyone from the ClD
reports at the front desk.

729
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,307
Any ClD reports
to the front desk.

730
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,815
Respectfully, sir,
I would feel better if you cleared this

731
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,373
through the chain of command.

732
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,016
Yes, sir.

733
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,058
I'll think about that.

734
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,563
- Problem with the bosses?
- One in particular.

735
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,670
- That was our mayor-to-be.
- Carcetti?

736
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,237
Seriously?

737
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,402
He wants to meet.

738
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,935
You and him? Alone?

739
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,470
He wants to talk about
the police department--

740
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,540
what works,
what doesn't.

741
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,144
You have
the mayor's ear now.

742
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,882
Look at you.

743
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,355
Here's the thing:
What do I say?

744
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,880
What do you mean
what do you say?

745
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,825
How honest should I be?

746
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,124
I mean, it's one thing
for me to talk technical shit

747
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,629
or enforcement strategies,

748
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,996
but the shit
that actually goes on?

749
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,126
I start talking about that,
I don't know if I can stop.

750
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,398
Cedric, this is
your chance.

751
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,167
This is a career.

752
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,198
What if I take my shots
at Burrell and Rawls

753
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,836
and he decides not
to clean house? What then?

754
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,244
The new mayor
calls you up,

755
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,043
asks you for
your take on things,

756
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,811
and you don't want to be,
what, a politic?

757
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,184
Carcetti-- ugh.
I don't even know the man.

758
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,916
If he is calling you,

759
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,289
it's because guys like
Burrell and Rawls are on the ropes.

760
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,757
- Maybe.
- I know there is a risk,

761
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:04,632
but maybe I'd fire away...

762
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,838
both barrels.

763
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,472
I'll wait out here, man.
Up top.

764
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,779
I'll wait, I'll wait.

765
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,719
You got that grub,
you got that pot?

766
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,914
Aw, wait.

767
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,319
( quotes lyrics )
Yo.

768
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,020
Who made that track?

769
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,652
Yo, who you talking to,
dawg?

770
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,425
I'm asking
who Young Leek be.

771
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,932
You mean
2 Phat's cousin?

772
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,092
- Who?
- No.

773
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,533
Nigga, then how the fuck
should I know?!

774
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,093
Yo, who the fuck
is you talking--

775
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,129
- Aw, shit.
- Not bad.

776
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,436
Fuck that nigga.

777
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,939
What up, B?

778
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,315
- Where Ma at?
- Upstairs.

779
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,252
Michael, my daddy
came home.

780
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,026
Daddy came home?

781
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,725
- Look who home!
- Michael.

782
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,400
Damn, you grew.

783
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,523
And a pack of Kools
for Macia.

784
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,630
Still tricking
for that clown?

785
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,122
You know, I don't understand
why people talk trash about him.

786
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,157
All I know
is he loves me.

787
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,863
Well, when you
get tired of him

788
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,531
going upside
your head and all,

789
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,836
you'll really know
who loves you.

790
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:51,864
Whatever.

791
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,505
Whoa.

792
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,252
Motherfucker, what?

793
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,661
He had 12 years.

794
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,461
Parole.

795
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,865
It was only
a drug charge.

796
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,029
You swore he wasn't
coming back.

797
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,595
This is a good thing,
Michael.

798
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,040
It's going to be
back the way it was.

799
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,043
The way it was?

800
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,874
We a family again.

801
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,882
You lied to me.

802
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,450
People change, Michael.

803
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,758
He said you can give him back
the independence card too.

804
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,026
He gonna take care
of all that for us.

805
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,372
Thanks for coming up
from Washington.

806
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,436
The party is happy
for the opportunity.

807
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,845
You've got some heat
behind you at this point.

808
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,112
- But down to business.
- The way we see it,

809
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,779
we've got to cobble together
a citywide turnaround,

810
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,788
call it the "Baltimore Miracle"
or some shit.

811
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,723
Which starts with
a 10% drop in crime.

812
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,726
Since that was
your campaign cry,

813
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,990
- you want the double digits.
- No doubt.

814
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,327
Denny's got to do a bricks-and-mortar
project downtown,

815
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,559
put his name on something.

816
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,828
We're flushed with stadiums,

817
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,334
got hotels out of the ass.

818
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,769
You guys got a good
convention center?

819
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,205
- And a convention center expansion.
- Gotta put something up,

820
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,003
get the sign
on it that says,

821
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,441
"Brought to you
by Tommy Carcetti

822
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,705
and the citizens of Baltimore."

823
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,077
Well, think on it,
but you don't have

824
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,480
- too much time to decide.
- Anything else?

825
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,381
Education always polls good.

826
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,409
Oh no, we've got to
stay away from schools.

827
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,217
Our last
four administrations

828
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,088
Ieft us with an inner-city system
with inner-city problems.

829
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,990
We get involved,
start talking shit,

830
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,858
it becomes our mess.

831
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,363
Gotta respect the depths.

832
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,800
One, you get
the drop in crime;

833
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,462
two, you build
something downtown;

834
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,630
and three, you stay
away from schools;

835
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,970
And, four, you keep
your boyish good looks.

836
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,341
You do all that, you might be running
for governor in 2008,

837
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,609
maybe take back that
statehouse for us, hmm?

838
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,617
- Can you get him a square corner?
- Easy.

839
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,681
You okay?

840
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,912
Yeah.

841
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,851
You sure?

842
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,685
- Is it something at home?
- No.

843
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,818
- Come on.
- I said no.

844
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,691
Okay.

845
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:04,032
If there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

846
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,059
there's me,
but if you'd rather,

847
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,571
I can write you a pass

848
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,096
to see the social worker.

849
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,166
Just say when.

850
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,745
Michael, do you want
to see the social worker?

851
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,147
No.

852
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,534
I have to say,
I've never seen kids like them

853
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,006
this animated
in a classroom.

854
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,532
Focused-- the corner
culture kids, at least.

855
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,841
The ones with deeper problems,
they opted out of that.

856
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,278
Deeper problems?

857
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,043
We're not just up against
corner logic in there.

858
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,312
I am seeing oppositional
defiant disorders,

859
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,751
clinical depression,
post traumatic stress,

860
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,654
and with the girl Shaundra,
borderline psychoses maybe.

861
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,089
With those
type of problems,

862
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,787
we are gonna have to have
a social worker here full-time.

863
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,193
But the corner kids, yeah,
they really came alive.

864
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,663
Yeah, when they talk
about what they know,

865
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,689
they talk from here,
and they stay on point.

866
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,701
Shit, they have been even
taking turns in there.

867
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,032
Question is:
Can we get them

868
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,368
in that kind of mindset
on stuff they don't know?

869
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,134
Can we have them learn
on faith alone?

870
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,940
In all honesty,
this is uncharted territory.

871
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,077
Where do you go
from here?

872
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,708
How about we just
let this ride,

873
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,378
see where it takes us?

874
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,282
All right, see,
here's the thing:

875
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,347
Once you got it,
it's all you.

876
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,621
Anything happen,
I'm gonna have to fuck you up.

877
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,059
Yeah, but that's nothing.

878
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,222
'Cause the guy trusting me
on this-- Marlo--

879
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,789
he'll kill you
and your whole family.

880
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,528
So don't go
shaking the bottles

881
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,559
'cause Marlo weighs
that shit every time.

882
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,730
- I ain't shaking shit.
- See that you don't,

883
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,706
'cause if you do fuck with it,
I'm gonna know.

884
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,084
All right, that's good.

885
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,934
All right, it's good.

886
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,906
All right, see,
you're under 13 and shit.

887
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,910
So you're safe from everybody
but me and Marlo.

888
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,037
- So I'm a lieutenant now?
- Yeah.

889
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,444
You're my lieutenant.

890
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,710
And all I get is
an extra $10?

891
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,217
Yeah, you do this good,
and we'll talk.

892
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,317
See this guy here?

893
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,520
That's the grand jury
prosecutor.

894
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,654
Now, you lie to us,
it's just good clean fun.

895
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,599
But you tell tales to that
three-piece motherfucker, ooh, shit!

896
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,261
I ain't telling lies.

897
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,294
Hey, Gary, let me ask you this
hypothetically:

898
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,308
How much time does a witness
get for lying to your grand jury?

899
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,401
Are you kidding?
As much as I can get him.

900
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,378
- What's the max?
- 10 years.

901
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,142
Oh, you've got people
going away for 10 years?

902
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,173
Oh, hell yeah,
all the time.

903
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,684
10 years!

904
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,186
I thought he was going to say,
like, two or three.

905
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,415
Hey, look, that motherfucker
went upside my head.

906
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,616
I couldn't even
see straight.

907
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,147
Which motherfucker
are we talking about?

908
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,717
Then they got me
on that medication.

909
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,388
It made me groggy as shit.

910
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,421
Then this man starts
working at me--

911
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,798
- Fuck I did!
- I mean, shit!

912
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:28,999
I'm still groggy now.
I mean, I got to--

913
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,371
is there a washroom around?

914
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:42,575
- Lying motherfucker.
- For real.

915
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,421
Pull over, asshole.

916
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,087
Shit.

917
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,105
Step out of the car,
please.

918
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,374
Step out of the car.

919
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,037
Put your hands
on the car.

920
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,309
Got anything on you?

921
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,817
Have a seat on the curb.
Have a seat.

922
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,287
Cross your feet.
Put your hands on your head.

923
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,061
What the fuck
is this powder?

924
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,125
Lime from my mama's garden.

925
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,844
What are you building,
a clubhouse?

926
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,709
Oh, that shoot nails.
Be cool.

927
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,180
Oh, I know what it does.

928
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,113
I want my fucking camera.

929
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,765
I heard what you said
at Comstat the other day.

930
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,597
I also hear you're a commander
who knows police work.

931
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,466
That's what people
are saying.

932
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,996
So, yesterday I did
a ride-along in Eastern,

933
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,408
watched street pops,
undercover rips.

934
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:18,107
- So what am I thinking?
- My guess:

935
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:21,015
You witnessed a waste
of time, money, energy,

936
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,882
and, in few cases, talent.

937
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,046
Rawls says it's Burrell
and his numbers game.

938
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,113
He says if I unleash him,
put him in the driver's seat,

939
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,419
then all that
bullshit goes south.

940
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,392
See a return
of high-end police work,

941
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,225
says it'll be the dawning
of a new day.

942
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,993
- Rawls said that?
- Yeah.

943
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,365
Says he's just
following orders,

944
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,302
being a good soldier.

945
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,465
What do you say?

946
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,974
Mr. Mayor, if you
want to talk to me

947
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,737
about what happens
in the street

948
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,642
or what goes on under me
in the Western,

949
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,873
I'll talk your ear off.

950
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,711
But I'm a soldier too.

951
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,979
I don't go up the chain
with my opinions.

952
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:56,815
I can respect that.

953
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,616
I will say this though:

954
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,249
We did have one unit
doing high-end stuff--

955
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,282
Major Crimes working out
of an offsite

956
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,725
down on Clinton Street.

957
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:08,094
"Did" is past tense.
What wrecked it?

958
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,996
Good question,
Mr. Mayor.

959
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:14,868
With Ray Foersters'
passing,

960
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,499
I'm going to need
a new ClD commander right away.

961
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,374
Would you object to being
made colonel working under Rawls?

962
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,840
Under Rawls?

963
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,510
He is deputy ops,
is he not?

964
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,680
Is the mayor going to
make the changes

965
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,621
or just leave it
to the good soldier?

966
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:39,160
What I'm really asking is:
How for real are you?

967
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:42,563
Well, I guess we're going to
find that out together, aren't we...

968
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,296
Colonel Daniels?

969
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,506
What the fuck do we do?

970
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,503
I don't know.
These guys don't scare.

971
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,716
If we all kick in--
you, me, Sydnor--

972
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,914
maybe we could afford
a used camera.

973
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,514
I thought of that.

974
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,616
It ain't gonna match
the serial numbers

975
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,684
from the one
for my lSD.

976
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,896
We've gotta get wood
on Marlo.

977
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,901
It's the only way.

978
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,338
This Randy kid,
he can't give us a murder, right?

979
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,467
Shit, he can't even
give us a body.

980
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,034
But he says some
Little Kevin kid

981
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:32,174
was the one supposed
to tell Lex to go up in that alley.

982
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,706
Plus, what did fuck-nut
say Little Kev said?

983
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,877
"Lex went up the alley,

984
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,014
but he ain't coming back."

985
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,024
Maybe he saw
the whole thing.

986
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:44,788
Maybe he's
our eyeball witness.

987
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,557
- Little Kevin?
- Little Kevin.

988
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,101
Carry the four.

989
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,371
80, 100, 10, 20.

990
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,207
420.

991
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,678
Where's the rest?

992
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,307
Um... I'm on a hard strip.

993
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,681
It's tricky on Lafayette.

994
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,709
What the fuck are
you doing there?

995
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,085
I've got to build it up.

996
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,818
Nah nah, you ain't got
to build up shit.

997
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,793
Your father built them corners,
and they owe you

998
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,727
'cause they owe him.

999
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,424
Bodie's got
a real short memory

1000
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,091
when it comes
to giving props.

1001
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,464
Ma.

1002
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,202
I going to straighten
this shit out right now.

1003
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,436
Ma, let me build.

1004
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,171
Ma!

1005
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,479
Sir.

1006
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,314
Bill...

1007
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:47,418
we need to regroup.

1008
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,290
I've come up
with something fresh

1009
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,817
for the new administration.

1010
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:58,024
Hmm? I don't mind
telling you,

1011
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,936
I'm uncomfortable with the way Carcetti
is running around in our shop.

1012
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,408
He's talked to me
several times.

1013
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,582
You're making
your move, huh?

1014
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,217
We were a good team,
you and me.

1015
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,493
We were.

1016
00:54:56,993 --> 00:55:00,087
- Miss Ella, where Bug at?
- He went home, Michael.

1017
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,995
Nah, he waits for me.

1018
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,967
The man who came and picked him up
said he was his father.

1019
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,333
And Bug said so, too.

1020
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,894
Fuck!

1021
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,104
Mmm.

1022
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,686
What the fuck
did you do?

1023
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,357
And why'd you
let him do it?

1024
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,867
- Hey, listen to me--
- No.

1025
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,234
That's how you got him
with his head up his ass--

1026
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,671
unsolving his own
fucking murders.

1027
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:46,642
Your job is to turn red to black,
not the other way.

1028
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,040
And you, stand the fuck up
for yourself.

1029
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,184
You don't got to
do the whole thing

1030
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,692
on your fingers,
little man.

1031
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,854
Look, first count--

1032
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,022
six and six is...

1033
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,156
12.

1034
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,827
Put down the two,
you bring over the one.

1035
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,029
- Bug.
- Hey, big man.

1036
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,401
Get over to me now.

1037
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,406
- We were just going to--
- Now.

1038
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,500
Yo, hold on.

1039
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,495
Yo, you owe me $800 on that,
bitch. You owe!
