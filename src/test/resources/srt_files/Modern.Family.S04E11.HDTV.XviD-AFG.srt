1
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:05,787
Jay?

2
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,159
Have you seen the grapes?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,419
- Yeah, I ate them.
- Why would you eat the grapes?

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,976
They were in a bowl,
they were washed,

5
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,938
I paid for them.

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,384
They were for the New Year's.

7
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,755
Oh, right.
What's that goofy thing again?

8
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:17,471
It's not goofy.
It's a tradition.

9
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,658
At midnight, you eat 12 grapes,

10
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:22,660
you make 12 wishes,
one for each month of the year.

11
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:24,183
And you really think that works?

12
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:25,018
Five years ago,

13
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,099
I was a single mother living in a slum.

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,550
Today, I'm driving to Palm Springs

15
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,191
in my new car
with my rich husband.

16
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,873
You do what you want.
I'm eating the grapes.

17
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:38,926
For New Year's Eve,
we're taking Phil and Claire

18
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,811
and Mitch and Cam
to this amazing hotel

19
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,532
I used to go to in Palm Springs.

20
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,976
They got a whole package--

21
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,159
dinner, dancing, toast at midnight.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,623
I mean, what more do you need?

23
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:49,730
- Grapes.
- I said we'd stop on the way.

24
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:53,244
Haley, it's New Year's Eve.

25
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:55,178
Are you sure you don't wanna
go to a party or something?

26
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,467
And listen to all
my friends talk about

27
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,046
how awesome college is?

28
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:00,536
I know how awesome college is.
That's what got me kicked out.

29
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:01,676
Well, I'm sure Uncle Mitchell

30
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:03,170
will feel much better
leaving Lily here

31
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:04,874
knowing that you're in charge.

32
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,299
You know you're really
in charge, right?

33
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,167
How do you know
I don't have a party?

34
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:12,758
Okay, fine.

35
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:18,344
Lily, are you ready for your big
sleepover with your cousins?

36
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:20,215
Who's watching me?

37
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,534
- Haley.
- I'm serious.

38
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:23,351
Alex.

39
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:25,281
Okay, let's go.

40
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,505
Every New Year's Eve, it's like,

41
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:29,699
"what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?"

42
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,146
So we were happy that Jay
planned this whole thing.

43
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:33,831
It really, you know,
takes the pressure off

44
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,971
of having to outdo ourselves.

45
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:37,669
Yeah, and how are we gonna
possibly top last year?

46
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:40,544
Oh. Did we miss it?

47
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,947
- Mm?
- It's only 10:00.

48
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,315
- What?
- It's only 10:00.

49
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:46,584
- What?
- It's only 10:00.

52
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:03,053
Place is smaller than I remember.

53
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,568
Smaller's your issue?

54
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:06,942
When was the last time
that you were here, Jay?

55
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:09,556
Not that long ago.
1974, '75.

56
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:10,764
So when I was 2?

57
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,077
I don't like when you do that.

58
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,476
I checked the web site.
The pictures looked beautiful.

59
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:16,058
Oh! Lizard. Huh?

60
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,239
Never trust pictures
on the Internet.

61
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,123
Shoot it from the right angle,

62
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:21,582
you can make anything
look bigger and better.

63
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,630
Houses, you pervs.
He's a realtor.

64
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:27,128
I thought I heard voices.

65
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,546
Robby! I told you! It's people.

66
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,528
Oh, my God.
That's me in 20 years!

67
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:34,399
Okay, you be her,
and I'll be whoever left her.

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,008
Uh, we're checking in.
It's under Pritchett.

69
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:38,436
Jay Pritchett. Three rooms.

70
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,290
You've been with us before.

71
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,445
How old is that book?

72
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,512
Oh, there is something
sticky over here.

73
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,675
Robby!

74
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:48,804
It came back.

75
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:50,564
It's not possible.

76
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,564
Okay, so the place
is not what it used to be.

77
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:56,259
But we're gonna have fun.

78
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:57,882
Dining in the starlight room,

79
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,976
little dancing with
the Shelley Stroman trio.

80
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:03,027
Oh, there's just two left.
Here are your keys.

81
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,645
Check out's at 11:00,
but if you wanna stay longer--

82
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:08,618
No, 11:00 is good. Yeah.

83
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:11,850
Here we go.

84
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,309
Is there anything wrong?

85
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,859
No, no. No, we were
just hoping for something

86
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,503
- a little more romantic.
- Come on, now.

87
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:19,955
It's not that bad.

88
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:21,858
- What's in there?
- Nothing.

89
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,242
If you're looking for romance,

90
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,171
there's a secluded
hot spring nearby.

91
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,445
- Kind of a hidden gem.
- Huh?

92
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:30,708
Just follow the path

93
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,956
right by the 12th hole
of the golf course.

94
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:35,915
Wow. That sounds kinda nice.

95
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,693
Secluded. Natural.

96
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:40,614
- Sexy.
- Sexy.

97
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:42,634
What do you think, Phil?

98
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:45,048
Does it smell like eggs?
Some of them smell like eggs.

99
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,184
It's been a while
since Phil and I...

100
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,969
The whole month of December?

101
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,787
Or a quick... you know?

102
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:57,937
It's embarrassing,
and it's not like us.

103
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:58,903
That's making me anxious,

104
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,346
which is why I really need to get...

105
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:02,770
Thanks again.

106
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,658
Yeah, that's yours to keep.

107
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,178
Okay.

108
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,481
Bye now.

109
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:11,155
I say we bag dinner with my dad,

110
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,442
and go find that hot spring.

111
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:14,082
Honey, we can't just
ditch your father.

112
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,393
He wanted us all to be together.

113
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:16,756
We are always together.

114
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,991
Oh, my God, what are we gonna hear

115
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,905
that we've never heard before?

116
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,843
Mitch and Cam's inspiring story

117
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,986
of how Lily saved
that kid with the heimlich?

118
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,782
Please. She hugged him,
and he spit his gum out.

119
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,949
I say we get a bottle of champagne,

120
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,518
look up at the stars,

121
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,287
forget our bathing suits.

122
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,351
- That does sound hot.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,216
But I'd just be thinking about
your dad the whole time.

124
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:40,050
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

125
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:44,475
What's in there?

126
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:45,834
- Nothing.
- Oh.

127
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:48,891
Oh, perfect. No, great.

128
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:50,459
If we need any socks,
someone left one in the bed.

129
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,518
Oh, my gosh.
There is no way Crispin stays here

130
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,049
when he comes to The Beacon.

131
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,095
What's The Beacon?

132
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:56,758
The club that
he's always raving about.

133
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,312
It's right down the street.

134
00:04:58,313 --> 00:04:59,846
That's where we should go.

135
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,027
Somewhere fun for New Year's,

136
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:03,097
while we're still young... ish.

137
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,860
L-let's get out of dinner
and go there.

138
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:06,126
- How?
- I don't know.

139
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,832
Um... okay, okay.

140
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,469
Um, y-you could pretend 
to get sick at the table.

141
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,151
You know, fake a cough,
stomachache,

142
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:13,233
dealer's choice.
I don't care.

143
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,959
Just sell it and get us out of there.

144
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,848
But what about your dad?

145
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,627
He wants the family to be together.

146
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:19,031
We are always together.

147
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,989
I mean, how many times
do we have to hear Claire tell us

148
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,891
Luke's hilarious comeback
to the pediatrician?

149
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:25,346
Oh, gosh. We should start
calling her "ranch house"...

150
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,289
Because she doesn't have
a second story.

151
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,486
- So good.
- I know! Thank you.

152
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,842
Hey. You sure you don't wanna
play "The hunger games"

153
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:34,460
with all of us?

154
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:35,668
My whole life is a hunger game.

155
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,455
Why do you think
I'm so mean to you?

156
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,470
That's for me!

157
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,454
Hey. Come on in.

158
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:44,246
Hey. Hi.

159
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,312
Hey, I'm out.

160
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,730
This is Becca and her cousin Joyce.

161
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,055
And Joyce is for you.

162
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,387
What? I'm on a date?

163
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,254
But I'm not wearing any cologne.

164
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:53,743
Did you know this was happening?

165
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,189
I don't even know what this is.

166
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,783
Joyce, this is Manny.

167
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:58,398
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

168
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,874
Can I offer you a glass
of sparkling cider?

169
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,683
He's not how you described him.

170
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,236
Uh, don't worry. You'll love him.

171
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,534
Manny, say something romantic.

172
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:08,424
I can't just turn it on.
You say something romantic.

173
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,289
- Cool shirt.
- Aw!

174
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,370
Can I see your room?

175
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,109
Well, I didn't clean it for me.

176
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,245
W--

177
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:21,347
They're going upstairs alone.

178
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,486
- Is that even allowed?
- I don't know.

179
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:25,563
- Should we say something?
- Like what?

180
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:27,405
Like, "it's not okay"?

181
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,162
Well, maybe it is. Is it?

182
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,683
I don't know. I just feel like

183
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:32,230
we're not doing
our job as babysitters.

184
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:33,538
Of course we are.

185
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:39,036
I'm cold, and I saw a coyote.

186
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,514
...And Luke turns to him and says,

187
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:48,486
"Dr. Blaustein, really?
Not even dinner first?"

188
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:53,430
Hand to God!
Dr. B. told me himself!

189
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:00,790
You know, I'm sorry,
but I love this place.

190
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,937
I know it's a little rough
around the edges,

191
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:04,916
but I've always had
a good time here,

192
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,893
and I'm having a great time tonight.

193
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:07,895
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:09,325
How's your chicken Kiev?

195
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:10,824
- It's really good.
- It's very good.

196
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:12,867
- Tasty.
- Yeah, tastes like Russia.

197
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,378
What are you waiting for?
Get sick.

198
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,439
Not yet. I'll know when it's time.

199
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,686
- Honey.
- Ay.

200
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,574
- You were sleeping.
- I was.

201
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,315
Ay, I'm so sorry, Claire.

202
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:24,894
It wasn't because
you were telling again

203
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,450
the Luke and the doctor story.

204
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,941
It's just that I've been
so tired lately.

205
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,583
Oh. Oh, gosh.

206
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,231
- Are you okay? She's been feeling
bad all day. - Oh. Yeah, you know.

207
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:36,190
- I think I might be coming down
with a little something. - Oh, man.

208
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,131
Oh, my God.

209
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,023
I know. I drank
out of her glass earlier.

210
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,642
- No. She's stealing our excuse.
- What?

211
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:42,847
Honey.

212
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:44,505
Wake up, Gloria!

213
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:47,301
Easy. If that makes a mark,
I get the stink eye.

214
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:48,344
I'm gonna walk her upstairs.

215
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:49,844
I think you need to lie down.

216
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,996
Okay. Just a little disco nap.

217
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:54,162
- Okay.
- Well, this has been fun.

218
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:55,032
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

219
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,265
Keep the party going.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

220
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,774
There it is. Now?

221
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,722
No, I have something
stuck in my throat.

222
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,699
It's too bad Lily's not here
to give you the heimlich.

223
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,079
Did we ever tell you
guys that story?

224
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,568
Do you wanna tell it?

225
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,524
Yeah, let me tell it. Okay.

226
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:13,983
Jay, you should go back and
spend time with your family.

227
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,811
I can't leave you alone
on New Year's Eve,

228
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:18,302
even though everyone's
waiting for me to come back.

229
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,421
Aw, that's so sweet.

230
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:20,543
Yeah. I just hope I don't hold up

231
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:22,570
the lighting of the cherries jubilee.

232
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:24,883
Jay, if you really want to go and--

233
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:25,949
Okay.

234
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,805
Where'd everybody go?

235
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:34,718
I don't know.
I guess they all left.

236
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:37,838
You still want the cherries jubilee?

237
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:39,711
Light 'er up.

238
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:54,115
Hey, if it isn't Jay Plunkett.

239
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,884
It isn't.
It's-- it's Jay Pritchett.

240
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,589
You having a good New Year's?

241
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:00,486
Eh, kind of a bust.
Everybody bailed on me.

242
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:01,379
I'm gonna hit the sack.

243
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,599
Hey, we just had a guy
who bailed on us.

244
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,860
You play Hold'em?

245
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,431
Yeah, but I should probably, uh...

246
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,051
What's the buy-in?

247
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,310
Jay...

248
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:15,662
Say hello to, uh, Marty, Bugs...

249
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:16,222
Hey. How ya doin', Jay?

250
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,623
- My ex-husband Hugo...
- Hey, how you doing?

251
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,098
- And Billy Dee.
- Hey.

252
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:23,023
Are you serious? Billy Dee Williams?

253
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,843
I'm a huge fan.

254
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:26,271
Well, now you have to stay,

255
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:27,455
since none of these guys
have seen me

256
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,544
in anything since "Mahogany."

257
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:31,294
- Never even saw that.
- Me either.

258
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:32,087
You're kidding.

259
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,199
Billy Dee's an alderman

260
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,214
trying to keep Diana Ross in Chicago,

261
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,108
rather than become

262
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,552
an international model and designer.

263
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:42,059
My son made me
watch it with him.

264
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,083
He's gay.

265
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:46,231
Oh, good. I didn't want
to be the one to tell you.

266
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,528
Excuse me! Sir, excuse me!

267
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,978
He's doing this on purpose!

268
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:59,590
He probably just doesn't notice us.

269
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:00,751
How can he not notice us?

270
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:02,786
We're the only people
in here in sleeves!

271
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,528
- Hey there.
- What can I get for ya?

272
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,784
Excuse me, young man.
I was here first.

273
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,869
Young man? Why don't you
just call him whipper-snapper?

274
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,957
Ugh. This is ridiculous.
We can't even get a drink.

275
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,911
Everyone in here's 11, and I'm hot!

276
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,015
If we were hot,
we'd be drinking right now. Hi.

277
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,288
Yeah, and if we'd stayed put,

278
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:19,051
we'd be enjoying
cherries jubilee right now!

279
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,959
Hey, hey, hey.
Cam, come on.

280
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,746
It's new year's Eve.
We're out together.

281
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,995
Where's fun Cam
who likes to dance?

282
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:26,536
Here.

283
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:27,865
Wh--where--where is he?

284
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,585
- I'm over here.
- Oh, there he is!

285
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,153
- Come on!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

286
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:33,964
I was just feeling invisible!
It'll get better!

287
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,472
Okay, you know what?
That is wet. I'm done.

288
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:41,237
Oh! God! God, no!

289
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,378
They've been in there forever.

290
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,576
Do something. You're in charge.

291
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:49,052
Oh, please. We both know
I'm just a figurehead here.

292
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:51,670
You really think they're doing
something in there? He's 12.

293
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:53,907
He's 14, but it's touching
how close you are.

294
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,299
Fine.

295
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,384
What do you want?

296
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:01,381
You have to keep your door open.

297
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:03,419
- Why?
- Uh, well, why do you need it closed?

298
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,037
Because we're gonna make out.

299
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:07,729
Well, you...

300
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,646
You can't have your door closed.

301
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:12,047
- Why? - Do you wanna to watch
or something? That's weird.

302
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,252
- Ew!
- Ew! Of course we don't wanna watch.

303
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,336
Perfect.

304
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:17,525
- But you can't--
- What are you d--

305
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,399
What just happened?

306
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:22,439
Can I offer you a piña Delgado?

307
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,525
It's my own concoction.

308
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:27,232
- What's in it?
- Let's just say it's cool, it's sweet,

309
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,423
and it's not afraid
to embrace its own whimsy.

310
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,153
I'm not saying that.

311
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:33,647
I'm not drinking it, either.

312
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:37,050
So... you making any resolutions?

313
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:39,516
Yeah. No more blind dates.

314
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,601
You're mean.

315
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:44,479
You know, she's right, Joyce.
You are mean.

316
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,527
I've been a gracious host

317
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:48,179
while you've been rude,
sullen, and dull.

318
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,134
You'll forgive me if I choose
not to start the new year

319
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,591
on such a negative note.

320
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,714
Oh, and if you're hungry
for broccoli later,

321
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,375
you'll find a piece in your teeth.

322
00:11:58,322 --> 00:12:00,152
Where is this stupid path?

323
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,391
We've been walking forever.

324
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:02,647
We'll find it.

325
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:04,615
Did that bellman seem
a little off to you?

326
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:07,441
Oh, totally.
Maybe there is no hot spring.

327
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:09,635
Maybe this is all part
of an elaborate plan to kill us.

328
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,073
Why would you even say that?

329
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:13,010
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

330
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:14,004
You seem so tense.

331
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:16,836
Come on. This is an adventure.
This is fun.

332
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,147
I don't wanna have an adventure.

333
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:20,308
I don't wanna have fun.
I wanna have sex with you.

334
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,583
Wha--what?

335
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:22,684
Don't make me say it again.

336
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:23,740
No, I want you to say it again.

337
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,631
Maybe throw my name
in there this time.

338
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,837
Claire, what's going on?

339
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:31,968
Do you know that
it's been a month?

340
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:34,649
- No, it hasn't.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, it has. Mm-hmm.

341
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,763
Day after Thanksgiving.

342
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:38,295
I remember because
I came in under budget

343
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:39,767
on all of my Christmas gifts,

344
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,340
and you know how
that gets me going.

345
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:42,387
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

346
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:44,590
I made that joke about
your clothes being half-off.

347
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,332
And yet we still did it,

348
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,800
'cause that's the kind
of people we used to be.

349
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,530
What happened?

350
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:51,849
Nothing happened. We're busy.

351
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,622
It was the holidays.
Dede was here.

352
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,682
- You know, she has a way of...
- Mnh.

353
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:57,240
Shutting that whole thing down.

354
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,718
But is this who we are now?

355
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,305
I mean, first it's a month,
then it's a year,

356
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,510
then we're sleeping in twin beds
and you're calling me "mother."

357
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:04,530
And I can't even bear it,

358
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:06,247
'cause we're just like my grandp--

359
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:09,885
Let's go find that hot spring

360
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,745
and start this new year off with...

361
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:14,182
- Sex in a hot spring.
- Mmm.

362
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:16,971
All right, all right.

363
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:18,207
Where-- where should we try next?

364
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,944
- Am I yelling? I'm yelling.
- Yes.

365
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:22,297
Yeah. Maybe we should just
go get some frozen yogurt

366
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:23,321
and call it a night.

367
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:24,164
No, Cam, come on.

368
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,253
We can't have another New Year's

369
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:27,048
where we don't even
make it to midnight.

370
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,013
I... this entire holiday

371
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:31,200
is just a giant reminder
of how the clock is ticking.

372
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,502
You know, each passing second

373
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:35,481
is just bringing us that
much closer to death.

374
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,512
All this because
I suggested some fro-yo?

375
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:39,993
I'm... I'm sick of feeling old.

376
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:42,293
I-I really need this.

377
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:43,090
Okay.

378
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,727
Let's get you to midnight.

379
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:47,118
'Kay.

380
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:48,910
Oh, look, he's our age.

381
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,938
Wherever he's going,
I'm sure he'll fit right in.

382
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,994
Okay.

383
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:57,002
Okay, no judgment.
Perfectly acceptable lifestyle.

384
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,642
- Just not for us.
- No!

385
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,585
Okay, but we are not
giving up, all right?

386
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:01,752
We're like Goldilocks.

387
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:03,037
The first bar was too young,

388
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,015
the second was...
whatever that was,

389
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:06,647
and the third will be just right.

390
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:07,432
Mitchell...

391
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,037
Three bears.

392
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,339
I mean... right?

393
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,550
Here. This one.

394
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,478
You wanted to feel young.

395
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,666
And I do.

396
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:36,009
I'm sorry. I push people away.

397
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,461
I feel myself do it,
but I can't stop.

398
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,765
It's hard to like someone
when you don't like yourself.

399
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:41,726
You're right.

400
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,724
You have so many good qualities.

401
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:46,852
You're attractive,
you're witty, you're bright.

402
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,123
I just wish you could see
yourself through my eyes.

403
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:51,450
Aw, you're such a good friend.

404
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,691
Friend?
That's where this is headed?

405
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,747
Well... friendships last longer.

406
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:57,957
Not this one.
I've got enough friends.

407
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,359
Happy New Year, Joyce.

408
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:04,507
So what's the plan, Haley?

409
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,924
I'm going in.
That's our baby brother up there.

410
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:07,984
I'm not ready for all of this.

411
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:09,624
The girls, the hormones--
it's gross.

412
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,634
Well, we can't just barge in.

413
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:12,186
I'm still trying to get the image
of mom and dad

414
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,012
out of my... Oh, God, it's back.

415
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,553
I'm coming in!

416
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:16,952
What are you doing?

417
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,685
Just putting away some laundry.

418
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,634
That's a bra.

419
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:21,843
And a tablecloth.

420
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:23,062
Can't you do this later?

421
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:24,922
Excuse me.
Does your mother know you're here?

422
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,222
- Yes.
- Does she know our parents aren't?

423
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:28,895
Yeah.

424
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,362
Big pause, no eye contact.

425
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,227
I was so much better
at this than you.

426
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,057
- You're out.
- No, she's not.

427
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,530
Yes, she is.
It's late, you're 13...

428
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:38,594
- 14.
- 14, and unless Nicole Bitchie here

429
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,957
wants me to call her parents
and tell them she lied...

430
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,637
I better go. Bye, Luke.

431
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,750
Wait.
Why does she have to go?

432
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,803
- Because I said so.
- You're not the boss.

433
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,192
Don't talk back to your sister.

434
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:49,544
Ugh! I hate you!

435
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:52,264
You hate me now,
but someday you'll thank me!

436
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:55,106
I think I owe mom a huge apology.

437
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,876
Is anyone watching me?

438
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,547
Aces and eights.

439
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:08,470
Lady sings the blues.
Three Jacks.

440
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:09,113
Sorry, Billy Dee,

441
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:11,001
but where do you go
to tattle on prince Harry

442
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,718
when he's naked in Vegas?

443
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,883
Straight to the queen.

444
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,205
Well, that's it. I'm out.

445
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,206
Me, too.

446
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,830
Oh, hell, it's almost 11:00.

447
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,985
I gotta do my set
in the starlight room,

448
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:22,217
and I'm missing a pasty.

449
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,318
Oh, what's the matter with everybody?
It's early yet.

450
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,272
Yeah, I'm having fun

451
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:27,263
for the first time since I got here.

452
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:28,055
Jay?

453
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,502
How long has she been there?

454
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:30,813
What are you doing here?

455
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,324
Gloria...

456
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,850
Everybody ditched me,

457
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:36,097
these guys invited me to play poker,

458
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:38,224
and look who I'm sitting next to.

459
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:40,919
- Eh... 
- Oh, she has no idea.

460
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,636
Hello, I'm Billy Dee Williams.

461
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:45,147
Hello. I'm Gloria Dee wife.

462
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:48,512
Jay, it's almost midnight,
and we forgot to buy my grapes.

463
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,534
Did you try room service?
They probably have grapes.

464
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:52,476
Oh, nothing fresh.

465
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:55,842
But you can always fish some
out of a can of fruit cocktail.

466
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:58,924
Jay, you know that I need
real grapes for my wishes.

467
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:01,489
It's a Colombian tradition.
It's only moderately insane.

468
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,943
Well, I have grapes at my house.

469
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:04,169
No, I don't want you
to blow New Year's.

470
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,843
Oh, please. Every night
is New Year's for Billy Dee.

471
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,907
I like you, Billy Dee.

472
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:14,097
So at midnight, you eat them
and then you make your wishes.

473
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,776
Well, that sounds vaguely familiar.

474
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,879
I might have heard about that

475
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,929
when I did that
"Love boat" with Charo.

476
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,036
You know Charo?

477
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:21,900
He's so obsessed with Charo.

478
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:23,588
No kidding.

479
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:25,698
Oh, my God.

480
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,187
A classic Rolls Corniche.

481
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:32,227
I have been in love
with this car my whole life.

482
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:34,616
In my village,
if you didn't drive one of these,

483
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:37,789
you couldn't call
yourself a drug lord.

484
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:39,902
Would you like to drive it?

485
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:42,600
Does the bear sit in the woods?

486
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,034
Classic Charo.

487
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,834
Mmm? So...

488
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,091
Was it worth my meltdown?

489
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,490
It always is.

490
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,672
Just you and me,
under the desert sky.

491
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:01,396
I'm Lawrence of Arabia,

492
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:02,755
you're Mrs...

493
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,135
of Arabia.

494
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:08,336
Hey there.

495
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,442
Oh, my God.

496
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:12,188
Sweet. You're the first ones here.

497
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,270
Welcome.

498
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,455
Uh, welcome to what?

499
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:18,366
To Nude Year's Eve.
You saw the flyer?

500
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,188
- No.
- No.

501
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:20,788
I told them.

502
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:22,442
Robby.

503
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,096
So I--whoa.
Nude Year's Eve?

504
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,592
You said Nude Year's Eve.
It's clever.

505
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:29,902
Yeah. We're the Palm Springs
nudist association.

506
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:31,870
It's how we celebrate the new year.

507
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:34,828
- I can see.
- Fresh. Like newborns.

508
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:35,982
Naked.

509
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,695
- Yeah.
- I got that. Yeah.

510
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:38,893
Oh, my God.
We have to get out of here.

511
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:40,202
We have to get out of here.

512
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,343
Our clothes are trapped
under that pile.

513
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:43,475
You really wanna stand there naked

514
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:45,452
sifting through 
all those drawstring pants?

515
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,765
Oh, okay. Scooting over.
Just... just scootch in.

516
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,335
- Okay.
- Scootin'.

517
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:52,124
- Ah.
- Hey.

518
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,153
Phil, something just touched me,

519
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:54,902
- and it's not from your side.
- Oh!

520
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,426
Who wants champagne?

521
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,492
Oh, I'll have some.

522
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,439
- Okay. Oh, my gosh.
- Okay.

523
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,291
Oh, sorry. Pardon the reach.

524
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,083
Thank you.

525
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,729
We gotta make a run for it.

526
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,466
Well, now it's just
gonna seem rude.

527
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:09,257
Phil.

528
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,746
I love this car so much!

529
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:14,355
Where you gonna
take us next, Billy Dee?

530
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:16,469
A surprise that's
gonna blow your mind.

531
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,095
And just call me Billy.

532
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:18,985
Not doin' it.

533
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:26,755
And these are from the gentlemen
at that table over there.

534
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:29,043
Oh, free drinks.
More free drinks.

535
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,730
Thank you. Thank--
they can't hear me.

536
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:31,996
Thank you!

537
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:34,811
This is what models must feel like.

538
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:37,434
Excuse me, but has
anyone ever told you

539
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:39,539
you look like a young van Johnson?

540
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,228
Oh, no.
That-- that's so sweet, though.

541
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,344
Thank you.

542
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,756
Mm. Free pass?

543
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:44,828
Pull up van Johnson on your phone.

544
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:46,221
I need to know
how I feel about that.

545
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:47,869
He was gorgeous. You're fine.

546
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,580
This is nice, huh?
Compliments, free drinks.

547
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:51,942
What could be better?

548
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:55,072
Alright gentlemen!
Almost midnight!

549
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:56,304
Pucker up.

550
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:58,505
New Year's is so weird,

551
00:19:58,506 --> 00:19:59,888
the way it makes you
think about time.

552
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,900
Ten... nine... eight...

553
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,253
- Cam.
- Mm?

554
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:03,791
I think that's why

555
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,371
people put so much pressure
on themselves to have fun.

556
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,187
Seven... six... five...

557
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,083
I mean, I guess I sorta get it.

558
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,232
Four... three... two... one!

559
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:21,523
Quick, quick! Make your wishes!

560
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:24,008
Like right now I wish
I could just slow down time,

561
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:27,139
'cause I am so not ready
for him to grow up yet.

562
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:29,798
I know.

563
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,722
I want him to stay
our stupid little brother.

564
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,129
Hey, happy New Year.

565
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,002
You too.

566
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,479
Oh, my God, what is in this?

567
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,261
- Oh. Sorry. That one's mine.
- Oh.

568
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,390
...And I swear to you,
I was so nervous,

569
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,455
I think I might have put on
somebody else's underwear.

570
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:55,378
- I'm not kidding.
- Ew!

571
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,728
I love this story.

572
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:59,277
- Almost as good as yours, van Johnson.
- Oh, my God!

573
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:00,106
Oh, look. Here comes Jay.

574
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:02,114
- I feel bad he missed all this fun.
- Oh! - Hi!

575
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:04,463
- Hi, dad.
- Look, they're back. My devoted family.

576
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,701
Everyone, this is our dear friend,
Billy Dee Williams.

577
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:07,767
Hey, hey.

578
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,283
Oh, my God, it's Lando.

579
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:12,278
Excuse me, Mr. Williams,

580
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,008
I just have to tell you,

581
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,038
I've loved you since
I was a little boy.

582
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,495
I'm so starstruck right now.

583
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,399
Well, you must be Mitchell.

584
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,671
Jay told me all about you.

585
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:31,071
