Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:06,973
Put down the bag. Put down the bag
and place your hands on your head.

3
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:08,302
Stay right where you are.

4
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:11,139
Tusk isn't planning his next attack
even as we speak?

5
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:12,522
It's time we go on the offensive.

6
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:15,526
The casino. We go public
as soon as possible.

7
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:18,277
Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.

8
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:20,027
<i>I had nothing to do
with it, Raymond.</i>

9
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:22,334
I can smell the horseshit
through the phone.

10
00:00:22,426 --> 00:00:25,103
<i>Mr. President, would you walk us
through your history with Raymond Tusk?</i>

11
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:27,849
Everyone is fair game now,
including me.

12
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,419
- What can I do? - Come and visit me
when I'm in prison.

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,462
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters
within three miles of Yonaguni Island.

14
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,088
It could have to do
with shipping routes.

15
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:39,098
Or the trade war. They can't
pick on the big kids,

16
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,295
so they're picking
on the little one.

17
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:43,003
Almost every woman in the
House supports this bill.

18
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:44,533
And I can't be one of them.

19
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:47,253
If the bill goes to the floor
as is, I won't just bow out.

20
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:48,367
I'll actively fight it.

21
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:49,444
Has Claire said anything?

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,033
Just that things have
been a little rocky.

23
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:53,694
- We saw someone.
- You mean a therapist?

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,039
- Weren't you worried about exposure?
- I could put you in touch.

25
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:58,341
How can I help?

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

<i>...a longstanding source...</i>

<i>to the public, the</i>
<i>vice president's statement...</i>

32
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,458
The vice president just entered
the Department of Justice.

33
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,804
We're here with Ayla Sayyad,

34
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:19,488
whose
<i>Wall Street Telegraph</i> article

35
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,729
catalyzed the investigation.
Ayla.

36
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,650
The issue at stake is whether the
White House was in any way involved.

37
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,727
Was foreign money traded
for political favors?

38
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,888
Did it influence
diplomatic relations?

39
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,768
Just the act of laundering
Chinese contributions is illegal.

40
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,568
If it had a significant impact on
White House policy, that's
a far more serious crime.

41
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,088
You've met with Daniel Lanagin
on multiple occasions.

42
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:43,608
We were in the same room, yes,
on 11 occasions since 2003.

43
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,809
But we only spoke
on three of those occasions.

44
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,529
- Those instances are highlighted.
- What did you discuss?

45
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,727
These were fund-raisers.
I speak to dozens of people.

46
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,607
Usually about nothing at all.
I'm Southern, Ms. Dunbar.

47
00:01:57,608 --> 00:02:00,929
My mother taught me that conversation
during mealtime is not only polite,

48
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,088
it aids the digestive process.

49
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,528
So you didn't speak to him about
the Adohi Tribe's contributions

50
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:08,808
- to any of these super PACS?
- Absolutely not.

51
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:12,967
I never discuss super PACs with
any supporters. We both know the law.

52
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,329
During one of these
polite conversations,

53
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,648
do you recall Mr. Lanagin
ever mentioning Xander Feng?

54
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:21,328
- I do not. - Does that name
mean anything to you?

55
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:23,208
Other than being plastered
all over the news?

56
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,008
In that regard, it means
as much as Kim Kardashian.

57
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,088
Then let me be more specific.
What knowledge do you have

58
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:35,489
of Mr. Feng's political
activities?

59
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,288
- Is this coming from
your husband, or is it...? - From me.

60
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:43,608
And it's not that I don't
support the bill anymore.

61
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:45,607
It's just the article.

62
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,768
We've promised
Matt an interview.

63
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:51,288
Maybe in a few weeks, once
the investigation has died down.

64
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:53,488
The<i> New York Times</i>
isn't going to wait for us.

65
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,929
They've already scheduled the cover
for October, based on our timing...

66
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,328
Then I can't be a part of it.

67
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,008
- It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?
- Claire, come on.

68
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,648
It's OK. You can say so.
We're friends.

69
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,688
- It doesn't help.
- You don't actually believe...

70
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,368
No.

71
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:13,048
But enough of the
country still does.

72
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,009
And Garrett needs every bit
of support he can get right now.

73
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,328
So there's no convincing you?

74
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,808
I'll help you as much
as I can, quietly.

75
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,408
<i>There are rumors that you and Mr.
Feng served as back channels</i>

76
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,727
- to the trade summit last May.
- Exactly. Rumors.

77
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,209
We have Feng
in the US during the summit.

78
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,288
If he was back-channeling,
and even if I were aware,

79
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,610
any form of diplomatic
communication is usually classified.

80
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,769
Have you ever discussed Feng
with the president?

81
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,248
Any major player in Beijing
is worthy of discussion.

82
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:50,048
- So that's a yes.
- It's a general comment.

83
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,128
Did you discuss him
during the energy crisis?

84
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,328
I assume you're alluding
to his refinery co-venture...

85
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,168
- Yes, with Raymond Tusk. - The refinery
was never part of our conversation.

86
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:01,327
We needed an immediate solution.
A refinery would've solved
nothing in the short term.

87
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,408
And it's my understanding
that deal fell through.

88
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,208
Correct. But Tusk
did receive a subsidy.

89
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,648
As did every other
nuclear energy provider.

90
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,208
But his connection with Feng,
then a subsidy on samarium...

91
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,450
Nobody made any profits off these
subsidies. At best they're breaking even.

92
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,647
In fact, Raymond
fought us on the issue.

93
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:20,128
Then let's back up to
the Port Jefferson Bridge.

94
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:58,688
I don't blame her.
It's a valid concern.

95
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,289
Tell him I won't engage on Galloway,
so there's no point in asking.

96
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,528
This is Matt Bai, we can't dictate
what he'll ask. And he will ask.

97
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,488
Then I'll just say I won't
answer tabloid questions.

98
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:09,848
It's a legitimate question,
how the scandal could affect the vote.

99
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:13,728
Look, I say you pull out too.
We scrap the whole piece.

100
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:17,168
Jackie's fighting us.
The leadership is noncommittal.

101
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,448
We need this article
to refocus attention.

102
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,847
But it'll hurt you, both your
personal image and the bill.

103
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:27,008
But if we cut the cord, we schedule
two interviews then we cancel,

104
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,888
won't Matt be furious?
The story will be about pulling out.

105
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,648
We're talking about
the lesser of two evils.

106
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,488
I don't want you to become
the target, to undo all...

107
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,207
Then what if it's not me at all?

108
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,488
- You said the First Lady wasn't...
- Not her. Someone else.

109
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:42,008
Was the bridge a trade-off
to prevent additional GOP funding?

110
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,368
As far as I know, the bridge
was a delivery on a promise

111
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,647
the president had made to the
voters. Are we finished here?

112
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:50,608
Almost.

113
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,368
How many members of Congress have you
interviewed, Ms. Dunbar? About 200?

114
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,047
- One hundred ninety-four.
- I want to be of help,

115
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,008
but I doubt I can offer any more
than the 194 that preceded me.

116
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,927
- I have gotten some useful testimony.
- From who?

117
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:05,168
- A high-ranking House member.
- In the leadership?

118
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,328
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- Bob Birch? Jackie Sharp?

119
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:11,050
This individual says he attended
a meeting, July 14th, in the Oval Office.

120
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:13,208
She said "he."
So it must have been Birch.

121
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:15,448
I'm sure Raymond had no trouble
buying him off.

122
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,689
You attended that meeting also.

123
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,488
- It appears so. - You recall the
subject of that meeting?

124
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:26,247
A wave of conservative attack
ads. We were being outspent.

125
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:28,248
It must have been quite
a shock when Lanagin's tribe

126
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,168
shifted contributions
to the other party,

127
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,687
when they hadn't given a single
dime to the Republicans before that.

128
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,488
It would've been a shock, but we didn't
know where the money was coming from.

129
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,168
- According to my source...
- Bob Birch.

130
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,608
My source says the estimate
was 25 million.

131
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:44,248
You said, and I quote:
"With this kind of influx,

132
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:47,047
you can be sure somebody
isn't playing by the rules."

133
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:50,128
Sounds like something I might say.
Bob has a better memory than me.

134
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,088
The money stopped just after the
Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.

135
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,648
Is there a theory here, or are you just
grasping at straws?

136
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,889
The bridge leads to Feng.
Feng gives me Lanagin and Tusk.

137
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,367
- Tusk and the President...
- Ms. Dunbar, you want to play
six degrees of separation,

138
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,248
you could throw in Jimmy Hoffa
and the pope.

139
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:08,568
How about one degree
of separation.

140
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,528
Douglas Stamper,
your chief of staff.

141
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,648
This is him at Lanagin's casino,
July 14th.

142
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,048
I used these to get a warrant
for flight records.

143
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:21,288
The next day, Mr. Stamper
was on a flight to Beijing.

144
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:25,487
Why was he at the casino?
And why was he in Beijing?

145
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:29,088
- I would like to speak to my client.
- Please.

146
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,327
I work hard.

147
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,569
I keep things simple.
I know what my priorities are.

148
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:44,007
But there's this... this person.

149
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:48,049
She's not even in my life, except on
the edges making things blurrier.

150
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,930
It doesn't tempt me to drink.
It's more like she...

151
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:57,007
More like she feels what it was
like when I was drinking.

152
00:08:57,008 --> 00:09:00,608
When I couldn't get enough.

153
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:04,209
No matter how many drinks I had,
I wanted another.

154
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,249
I don't want to be with her.

155
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:13,367
I mean, I do.

156
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:15,329
But...

157
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,768
...it's more like
she's my daughter.

158
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,528
Or my mother.
I don't know, this is fucked up.

159
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,528
Take your time.

160
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,688
I should cut her off,
the way I did with booze.

161
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:38,008
That's all. I'm done.

162
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,327
- Thanks for sharing.
- Thanks for sharing.

163
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:42,368
We'll need time before
responding to your questions.

164
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:44,768
- I can wait as long as necessary.
- It could take a while.

165
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,528
There are national security
matters at stake.

166
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,207
The vice president needs to
consult with his advisors.

167
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,008
National security?
Are you really going

168
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,530
- to play that card, Oliver?
- His answers could entail

169
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:53,048
classified material.

170
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,847
- When can we expect a response?
- I'll let you know.

171
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:58,288
- May we hold onto the screen cap?
- Be my guest.

172
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:00,608
- We'll be in touch soon, Ms. Dunbar.
- Mr. Vice President.

173
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:02,648
If you think you're insulated, don't.

174
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,008
Our investigation is much
bigger than Douglas Stamper.

175
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,647
- That's enough, Ms. Dunbar. - Thank you
for your time, Mr. Vice President.

176
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:10,888
Happy to cooperate.

177
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,648
From the lion's den
to a pack of wolves.

178
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,089
When you're fresh meat, kill
and throw them something fresher.

179
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,848
Hey, I'm Fitz.

180
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:33,848
Doug.

181
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:38,087
You know, you can isolate,
white-knuckle this shit if you want.

182
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:41,847
Or you can ask for help.
You got a sponsor?

183
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:46,328
No, it's been 14 years.
I'm good.

184
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,089
Number's on the back
if you change your mind.

185
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,367
I thought you had a driver.

186
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:04,568
I do, but I didn't want him
overhearing anything.

187
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:08,768
- You shouldn't even be near this state.
- I'm not really here.

188
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,088
Long layover on my way
to California.

189
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:15,287
I've got auditors, federal agents,
in my office going through every file,

190
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,927
every document, they're going
through my goddamn trash.

191
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,967
Just stick to the Fifth
if she subpoenas you.

192
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:23,247
How did they know to look for Stamper?
To search the tapes on that exact day?

193
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:27,168
- Don't jump to conclusions.
- You're throwing me under the bus.

194
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,167
Underwood's the roadkill,
not you.

195
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:30,767
They're going to fuck me.

196
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:33,687
They'll find a way.
You know that.

197
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:36,288
And if that's the case, you and
your family will be taken care of.

198
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:40,207
They're already
offering me a plea.

199
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,407
You haven't even
been charged yet.

200
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:46,727
- If I cooperate. - You'll do less time.
But your family will have nothing.

201
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:48,448
They'll still have nothing
when you get out.

202
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,567
You testify against Raymond
and he'll still walk,

203
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:55,928
because all they'll have is your word,
and that doesn't count for much right now.

204
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,807
You wouldn't be here
if he wasn't afraid.

205
00:11:57,808 --> 00:12:02,887
I'm not here because he's afraid.
I'm here because you are.

206
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,247
And I want to make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

207
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:08,247
After repeated
conversations with Beijing,

208
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:10,249
they remain intractable
in their position.

209
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,448
This morning I gave orders
for a carrier group

210
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,567
to reposition near Okinawa.

211
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,767
This won't put our ships in direct
confrontation with the Chinese vessels,

212
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,847
but it will put them within
reach of air strikes.

213
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:22,808
I'll be informing the Chinese
ambassador later today.

214
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,048
We'll release a statement
in coordination with the Pentagon.

215
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:30,167
Sir, our stockpiles of samarium will only
last another two months at most.

216
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,527
- If we go this route...
- I've heard everyone's concerns,

217
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:36,487
and this is the decision
I've made. Any questions?

218
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,007
OK. Thank you.

219
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,329
Frank.

220
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,367
My deputy briefed me
on the latest.

221
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:54,808
How did it go?

222
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,127
We have a few follow-up
questions we have to address.

223
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,846
- Like what?
- Nothing major.

224
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,927
Just odds and ends,
a few details.

225
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:03,207
I was under the impression
this would be short and sweet.

226
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,048
So was I.
But she's very deliberate.

227
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,728
We need this over, Frank, at least as far
as the White House is concerned.

228
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,208
We can't be distracted.
Not with warships on the move.

229
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,008
I'm confident we're
in the homestretch.

230
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,968
You seem more concerned
than you're letting on.

231
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,327
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- You're fidgeting.

232
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,808
Oh...

233
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:23,287
It's my class ring.
I forget I...

234
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:25,726
- I buried it.
- You what?

235
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:28,728
I... It's a long story.

236
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:32,207
I've never seen you
this stressed before, Frank.

237
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,807
Well, I've never seen you
this tired before, sir.

238
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:37,048
You've got rings of your own,
dark ones.

239
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,688
They're getting worse,
aren't they?

240
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:40,928
You should take more naps
on those sofas in the Oval.

241
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,408
Naps don't cut it these days,
Frank. Not even a dent.

242
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:51,207
Lie after lie.

243
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,607
First to a prosecutor,
then to a president.

244
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,208
I feel exposed,

245
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:02,008
like the skin where
my ring used to be.

246
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,448
Even Achilles was only as strong
as his heel.

247
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,207
Where's Doug?
He's not answering his phone.

248
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,687
- He went to a meeting, sir.
- In the middle of the day?

249
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,368
I think he's on
his way back now.

250
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:19,768
I want him
back as soon as possible.

251
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:31,167
Sir, this arrived for you.
The watch you gave Remy
when he left for Glendon Hill.

252
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:34,047
I recognized it from
the quote on the back.

253
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:38,127
- Was there a message?
- No, just the watch.

254
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,288
- Let's find Doug.
- Right away, sir.

255
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,768
Forgive the plastic.

256
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,607
Luc Tuymans.
He's the real thing.

257
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,127
Well, I'll take your word.

258
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:57,047
It's not mine. None of it.
California.

259
00:14:57,048 --> 00:15:00,967
You want to sell your house,
your Realtor decorates it.

260
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,927
Well, one room at least.

261
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,727
Where are you moving?

262
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:09,927
Oh, I have a little
ranch in Sonoma.

263
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:13,687
My wife's gone,
my kids won't talk to me,

264
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,689
but at least I'll
have my painting.

265
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,767
- You paint?
- No, and there's no ranch.

266
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:23,128
But the rest of it, the rest of it's true.
Cheers.

267
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:30,687
- I'm here about Jacqueline Sharp.
- Oh.

268
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:33,287
- We're thinking of hiring her.
- A lobbyist?

269
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:36,687
She could lose her re-elect.
Not a great time to be an incumbent.

270
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:38,727
I know you two were close.

271
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:43,207
So you're looking for what?
A recommendation?

272
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,047
We have the lowest turnover of any
shop on K Street. There's a reason.

273
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:50,927
What are you looking
for at Glendon Hill?

274
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:55,009
- A killer instinct.
- Well, she certainly has that.

275
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,527
Forgive me if I'm prying, but...

276
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,407
...did she have anything
to do with your...

277
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,368
Departure?

278
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:11,768
Jackie did what she had to do.
I'll never forgive her,

279
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,928
but I understand why she did it.

280
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:18,687
Did what exactly?

281
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:23,927
I paid cash for my ticket.
I was careful.

282
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,488
Clearly not enough.

283
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:31,327
Sir, the casino had cameras everywhere.
There was no way to avoid them.

284
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,607
But there had to have been
thousands of hours of footage.

285
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:37,287
- How they found that...
- I have to ask you a question, Doug.

286
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,127
And I'm sorry, but I need you
to be honest.

287
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:44,248
- Are you drinking again?
- God no.

288
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,367
- Truly?
- It's not an option.

289
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,847
Because it would explain a lot.

290
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,367
You have every right to be
upset. This was my fault.

291
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:55,007
I'm more concerned than I'm upset.
I need you now, Doug, more than ever.

292
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,328
I know.

293
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:00,687
We're not young men.

294
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,368
If we fail, we'll die in a cage.

295
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:09,968
I haven't been myself lately.

296
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:19,487
That's what you said
to me 14 years ago.

297
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:24,008
When I gave you a second chance,
it paid off. You got clean, Doug.

298
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,327
Nothing means more to me
than this job, sir.

299
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,847
Nothing.

300
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,887
Whatever's going on,
I need to know it can be managed.

301
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:34,487
And if you need my help,
I'm here to help you.

302
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:39,408
I'm good, sir. I can handle myself.
Things will be different.

303
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,128
I've never given
someone a third chance...

304
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:58,049
...until this very moment.

305
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:01,128
And I'm grateful.

306
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,328
You won't regret it.
Please believe that, sir.

307
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,687
It was Remy who alerted
them to the footage.

308
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:16,128
His going-away gift.
Read the back.

309
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,606
- What do you think he's trying to say?
- I don't know.

310
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:24,807
But track him down
and set up a meeting.

311
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:28,326
- What about Dunbar?
- We can't run from the facts.

312
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:31,928
I'll say whatever you want me to say,
I'll take responsibility for all of it.

313
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,568
- She could indict you.
- That's what having a staff is for.

314
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:40,487
I have a better solution.
We'll both take responsibility.

315
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,407
- How?
- Set up an interview with Dunbar,

316
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:45,407
day after tomorrow. You and I
need time to do our homework.

317
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:47,208
Yes, sir.

318
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:05,047
- When did this happen?
- Meechum helped me fix it.

319
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:07,927
They're not gonna let me run,
I have to work out some way.

320
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:12,326
- You carried it all the way up here?
- For privacy. I had help.

321
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:15,448
- Meechum.
- That's right.

322
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:18,767
Jack-of-all-trades.

323
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:23,288
- Handyman, furniture mover.
- Human shield.

324
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:32,608
How bad is it?

325
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:38,488
Bad.

326
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,929
They have evidence of Doug being
where he shouldn't have been.

327
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:47,128
What are you going to do?

328
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,287
Tell the truth.

329
00:19:53,288 --> 00:19:56,047
- You're not actually going...
- Selectively.

330
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:59,727
Don't worry.
It's a stumble, not a fall.

331
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:01,767
You aren't like this
when it's just a stumble.

332
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:05,889
- Like how?
- You're scared. I can tell.

333
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,648
Five hundred meters at 139.
That was my best.

334
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,128
Shoot for that.

335
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:10,287
- How have you been?
- OK.

336
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:13,008
- The meds are helping.
- Oh, that's good to hear.

337
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:16,687
Have a seat.

338
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,887
Those people at the end
of the street, it's intense.

339
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:23,807
They're there 24/7.
Twice as many on the weekends.

340
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:26,648
We're so used to it by now.

341
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,567
Can I take off my shoes?

342
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,567
I thought I should dress up,
but I am not good with heels.

343
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:39,887
Yes, of course.

344
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:42,688
My mom said
they went with the dress.

345
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,689
Much better.

346
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:52,567
Look, Megan, I know the last
six months have been difficult.

347
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:55,846
But I need your help.
We just don't have the support

348
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,567
that we expected
in the leadership.

349
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,847
Yeah, I figured this wasn't
just about checking up on me.

350
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:02,767
You changed your mind before,
and I understand why.

351
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:07,447
But now it seems as though
things are more stable with you.

352
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:12,288
- Are you willing? - It's hard to say no
when I'm in your house.

353
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:18,447
You hear those people out there.

354
00:22:18,448 --> 00:22:21,807
They're loud, but I think
we need to be louder.

355
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:25,807
And it can't be my voice
because I'm the "baby killer."

356
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:30,046
The "cheater." It needs to be
your voice. A clear voice.

357
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:32,567
I'm already testifying
at the court-martial.

358
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:36,247
But that's closed to the media.
It's not enough.

359
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:41,568
There are so many people this has
happened to, why does it have to be me?

360
00:22:43,168 --> 00:22:46,047
Because you're
the one who called.

361
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:49,486
Are you gonna try to put it out
before McGinnis gets sentenced?

362
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:53,768
- Seth, you have a minute?
- Matt, I have to call you back.

363
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,287
Close the door.

364
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:08,927
When the vice president brought you
on board I advised against it.

365
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:11,607
But I can't deny
you've done a good job.

366
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,446
I appreciate you saying that.

367
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:15,406
I'm very protective
of the vice president.

368
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,367
I find it hard to share
that duty with anyone else,

369
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:20,687
which leaves me open to error.
It's one of my faults.

370
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:24,247
As I told the vice president, I understand
that trust is something I need to earn.

371
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:26,607
- Given how I got the job...
- If the vice president trusts you,

372
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:29,447
then I trust you.
We're a team now.

373
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:32,247
And the truth
is I can't do this alone.

374
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:35,728
Anything and everything
you ask of me.

375
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:41,687
It might have nothing
to do with the media.

376
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:45,886
- Press secretary is just a title.
- Good.

377
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,647
We have two tasks.
First, find me Remy Danton.

378
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:50,527
- But be discreet.
- I'll track him down.

379
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,927
Second, I need you to go through
the vice president's travel logs.

380
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:55,287
- Everything in the past ten years.
- What are we looking for?

381
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:58,527
Anything that could hurt us.
I'll work forward, you work backward.

382
00:23:58,528 --> 00:23:59,767
I'm on it.

383
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:02,528
And, Doug, thanks.

384
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,008
Nancy, I need you
to order me a new phone.

385
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:23,287
You said "odds and
ends." The "homestretch."

386
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,527
I was presented with this
information just hours ago.

387
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:27,127
We're talking about
impeachable offenses...

388
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:29,006
- Not at all, sir.
- Your chief of staff...

389
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,046
I had a gut feeling
that the casino was involved.

390
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:32,526
I sent Doug to get
to the bottom of it.

391
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,327
You should've
taken this to the DOJ

392
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:35,846
- the first inkling you...
- That's what I didn't want.

393
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,926
To create some ruckus
if nothing was going on?

394
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,246
You can't go on conducting
your own investigations, Frank.

395
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,167
Fact-finding, due diligence,
whatever you want to call it.

396
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,807
If any laws were being broken,
I wanted to know.

397
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:47,046
That's what you want
to tell Dunbar?

398
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,206
That I didn't want to disclose

399
00:25:48,207 --> 00:25:49,487
our diplomatic protocols.

400
00:25:49,488 --> 00:25:51,206
That I was concerned
about the midterms.

401
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,727
And I wanted to protect the
president of the United States.

402
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:56,968
Maybe what I did was wrong,
but I didn't do anything illegal.

403
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,647
- You're certain of that?
- I've discussed this with my lawyers.

404
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:02,527
Dunbar does not strike me as the
sort of person who will put on the brakes,

405
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,366
even if we admit all of this.

406
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:09,446
If fact, it might encourage
her to dig deeper.

407
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:13,687
You're right. Which is why I want
to hand over all of my travel logs.

408
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,686
- And I think you should too.
- Volunteer them?

409
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:20,006
- As a gesture of cooperation.
- Haven't we made enough gestures?

410
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:22,406
It will take the
wind out her sails.

411
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:26,606
No, I don't...
want her poring

412
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:29,047
over every one
of my comings and goings.

413
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:33,166
He's worried about his marriage
counseling, as he should be.

414
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,967
If you're worried about your
marriage counseling, you shouldn't be.

415
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,846
Imagine the fallout,
if the public were to find out...

416
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,367
A needle in a haystack,
and not a needle Dunbar is looking for.

417
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:42,687
She's interviewed half of Congress.
That woman's after blood.

418
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:45,405
But not for gossip. Even if she
does raise an eyebrow,

419
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,846
you were visiting a sick friend,
weren't you?

420
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:53,167
- Ostensibly. - Well, she couldn't
possibly find any fault with that.

421
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:59,487
- I'd like Galich in here.
- I'll let you two talk privately.

422
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:02,567
- When are you seeing Dunbar?
- Tomorrow, so you have some time.

423
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:03,967
I'll speak to Bill
and get back to you.

424
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,407
He'll advise you against it,
which is his job.

425
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:10,527
But I would just encourage you
to think politics, and not legalese.

426
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,327
Thank you, sir.

427
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:20,447
Congresswoman.

428
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,886
Why should I vote for you?

429
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:25,208
It's... it's OK. Good night.

430
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,287
You look tired.

431
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:34,527
Long day on the campaign trail?

432
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,207
What are you doing here?

433
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,406
You never told me
about Havemeyer's daughter.

434
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,326
Everyone knows that.
The whole world knows.

435
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,885
But not that you visited her.
That you leaked it.

436
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:48,886
You came all the way to
California to ask me about that?

437
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,447
I came to California
to find out about that.

438
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:56,927
I offered to buy Havemeyer's house,
but he told me for nothing.

439
00:27:56,928 --> 00:28:01,126
You were right. It has been
a long day on the trail.

440
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,647
It's still a close race.

441
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,769
But not if the voters
knew how you became whip.

442
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:13,806
Are you honestly threatening me?

443
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:16,046
Set up a meeting with Frank.

444
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:20,326
I don't care what you talk about,
as long as you're alone and
the meeting is on the books.

445
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:21,567
Then you're gonna
sit down with Dunbar.

446
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:23,167
I've already done my interview.

447
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,927
Tell her Frank grilled
you on your testimony.

448
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:27,286
- Perjure myself?
- Save your seat.

449
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:30,086
You know what?
Tell everyone.

450
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:34,046
- Think how that would play out.
- I don't care.

451
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,846
You'd really toss yourself
off a cliff for Frank?

452
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:39,686
I have zero allegiance
to Frank Underwood.

453
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:43,327
I won't be manipulated by him, and I sure
as fuck won't be manipulated by you.

454
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:46,687
- I'm not bluffing.
- Then I was right.

455
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:48,967
- About what?
- How little I meant.

456
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:53,687
That has nothing
to do with this.

457
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:56,687
It has everything
to do with this.

458
00:28:56,688 --> 00:29:00,407
I should feel disgusted,
but I don't.

459
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:03,247
Just supremely disappointed.

460
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:21,366
We got the call ten minutes ago,
direct from the White House counsel.

461
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,647
The president's
turning over everything?

462
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:25,966
- From the day he took office.
- We're sure this includes

463
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:28,006
- the visits to his friend?
- It has to.

464
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:31,486
- It was full-security detail.
- Phenomenal.

465
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,127
We have something
we can work with.

466
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:36,366
- Now, as for my logs.
- They're clean.

467
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,166
- You bet your life on that?
- I would.

468
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,446
- Me too, sir.
- We've been through them twice,

469
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,446
- backward and forward.
- My statement?

470
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:47,528
- In your inbox.
- I looked it over. Seth did a nice job.

471
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:55,886
We need to go wide with this
the moment the interview's over

472
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,646
so we beat Dunbar to the punch in
case she decides to release something.

473
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,927
I'll be at my computer ready to press
send the moment I hear from Doug.

474
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:03,807
- Have either of you slept?
- We're awake, fully operational.

475
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:05,727
You take a shower
and put on a fresh suit.

476
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:08,247
Yes, sir.
I'll see you over there.

477
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:14,086
You have at least three hours.

478
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:16,726
Take a nap.
You can use my office.

479
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:19,447
General McGinnis was in the courtroom
when you testified.

480
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:24,247
- Yes. - Had you seen him in person,
I mean, since he assaulted you?

481
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:27,526
- No.
- What was that like?

482
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:31,808
- Not fun.
- Not fun how?

483
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,926
It was hard. Really hard.

484
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:39,926
Look, Megan, I agreed to change
the focus of my piece

485
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:43,526
to focus on you, and, you know,
I know this has gotta be hard,

486
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:45,606
but I need you to help me
out a little bit.

487
00:30:45,607 --> 00:30:48,966
I'm sorry, I'm not
very good at this. I'm nervous.

488
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:52,406
You seemed fine when you called
into Mrs. Underwood's interview.

489
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:54,766
She was there with me,
on the phone.

490
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:59,246
Your nerves, I know that's been
an issue since the assault.

491
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:04,006
The defense brought up what they
called emotional and mental instability.

492
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:06,086
That's what always happens.

493
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:08,606
The person who was attacked
gets attacked all over again.

494
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,606
- How did that make you feel?
- It made me angry.

495
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:15,647
The lawyer kept coming after me about
my panic attacks, my antidepressants.

496
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:18,486
But I just kept
staring at McGinnis.

497
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:22,166
I wanted him to see I could
take it. That I was strong.

498
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:25,527
- I wanted to make him look away first.
- And did he?

499
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:29,806
Yes, when I said he did
more than violate my body.

500
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:32,646
He betrayed his country.

501
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,326
He robbed it of a good Marine.

502
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,245
Let's talk about the sexual assault
bill in front of Congress now.

503
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:42,126
It's taken some significant opposition,
most notably from another veteran,

504
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:44,286
Jacqueline Sharp.

505
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:47,448
If you ask me, she's
betraying our country too.

506
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:53,487
- Ms. Dunbar.
- Mr. Vice President.

507
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:55,606
Thank you for giving us
a few extra days.

508
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:59,167
I have no problem being patient
as long as it leads to forthright answers.

509
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,567
Well, I won't make you
wait a moment longer.

510
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,006
Shall we?

511
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:10,767
Oh, you found it.

512
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:12,526
Have a seat, we're just
finishing up here.

513
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:15,966
What do you think, Mr. Tusk?
Keep growing it or have it shaved?

514
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,368
- I guess I'll keep growing it.
- No problem. Let me clean up the back.

515
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:24,047
No, Mack, if you'd give me
a couple minutes. Appreciate it.

516
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,926
I had this place built down here
about ten years ago.

517
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:32,646
I got tired of driving all the
way across town every two weeks.

518
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:36,126
- Now it's just an elevator ride.
- Convenient.

519
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:41,326
You know what isn't convenient?
Cramming eight attorneys in my office.

520
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:45,766
It was not designed for
the entire partnership of my law firm.

521
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,166
They're worried about Lanagin.

522
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,486
- He's a little shaky, but he'll hold up.
- Underwood?

523
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:53,847
Birch delivered.

524
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:58,006
- And did Dunbar bring up Stamper?
- The sessions are closed-door,

525
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,886
but I can't imagine she didn't.

526
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:05,448
And what about poor Havemeyer?
Was he any help to us on Jackie Sharp?

527
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:14,566
I do not take your hesitation
as a promising sign.

528
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:17,646
I never like disappointing you.

529
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,767
- He had nothing?
- No.

530
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:21,286
Hm...

531
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:23,726
Now, do you think that's
because there's nothing there,

532
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:26,966
- or because he's protecting her?
- There's nothing there.

533
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,166
- I can go to another congressman.
- No, no, no.

534
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,166
It has to be somebody
high-profile,

535
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,207
someone in the leadership
who will make waves.

536
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,927
- Let me get back to Birch.
- It's too obvious,

537
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:40,046
now that he's shown
no sympathy for Frank.

538
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:43,886
This can't look orchestrated.
Multiple fronts, Remy.

539
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:47,566
It has to be
Jackie Sharp. Mack?

540
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,046
Let's finish up here.
I gotta get back to work.

541
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:52,367
- You got it, boss.
- You need to get back to work too.

542
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:59,486
And what we discussed...
make it happen.

543
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:02,247
- You denied being a back channel.
- I did not deny.

544
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,846
I chose not to confirm
because it was classified.

545
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:08,005
- But your office has consistently...
- I instructed Doug to do so,

546
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,446
along with my communications department.
When a back channel becomes public,

547
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:14,166
- it defeats its purpose.
- An orchestrated deception...

548
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:17,086
If we had refused to comment,
it would've suggested it was true,

549
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:19,687
which would've endangered the
process. I really had no choice.

550
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:21,686
- Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.
- I know.

551
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:25,445
He's fleeing corruption charges,
not the first time he's been accused.

552
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:29,246
- And your question?
- I know he laundered the money.

553
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:33,006
It's just a matter of time before
I have the proof to substantiate that.

554
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:36,566
So my question, which I am asking again,
is whether you knew?

555
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:40,126
And I'll repeat my answer.
I did not.

556
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:44,246
I did sense that something was awry.
Doug was aware of my concerns.

557
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:47,806
And I took it upon myself to find out.
The vice president didn't know.

558
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:50,126
You had no knowledge he was
going to the casino?

559
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:54,166
None. But that doesn't mean I don't take
responsibility for my staff's behavior.

560
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,607
- The buck stops with me.
- And what did you find?

561
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:59,247
Nothing.
No illegal activity.

562
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,486
I don't have the same
resources that you do.

563
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:06,725
If you suspected, why didn't you
go immediately to the NIGC, the BIA,

564
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:09,087
- the Department...
- You have to understand, we're facing

565
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:11,406
very difficult midterms.
I didn't want to bring attention

566
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:13,926
to a series of allegations that
may have no basis in fact.

567
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:17,926
Now, that may have been misguided
logic, but that's how I chose to act.

568
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:22,286
The mistake is mine and mine alone.
Not Doug's, certainly not the president's.

569
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,886
It shouldn't surprise you
if I say it feels

570
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:27,206
like I am not getting
the full picture.

571
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:30,926
Which is why I'm prepared
to give you the full picture. Oliver?

572
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:34,726
The White House believes
in transparency.

573
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,526
All of the vice president's
personal travel logs.

574
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:39,086
And the last ten years
since I became whip.

575
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:42,606
As well as the
president's since inauguration.

576
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:47,845
There should be no doubt
as to whom we met with and when.

577
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:51,886
- I am skeptical about what this contains.
- Which is what we anticipated,

578
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:54,966
and why Oliver will walk you through
anything you might need to know.

579
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:58,166
It's all there, but if you have any
questions or requests,

580
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,767
we'll be happy to facilitate.

581
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,646
I mean, at first,
I was really nervous,

582
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:08,767
but then, as soon as I
started getting into it,

583
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:12,366
started speaking from my heart,
all these things poured out,

584
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:15,766
everything I wanted to say,
that I've been wanting to say.

585
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,966
Seth told me that Matt
was very impressed.

586
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,127
- I want to do more.
- More interviews?

587
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:23,606
Articles, TV, whatever it takes.

588
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:26,567
- I want to help.
- That's great, Megan.

589
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:29,926
Thank you for making me do this.

590
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:34,807
- It was a big step for me.
- You have a plane to catch.

591
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:36,966
I can stay longer,
if you need me to do another.

592
00:36:41,807 --> 00:36:43,646
Why don't you head
back to Chicago.

593
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:46,806
And as soon as we've put
a plan together, we can give you a buzz.

594
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:49,806
- Can I get a glass of water?
- Tap is fine, or you want bottled?

595
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:53,047
- I can get it.
- We've got Ms. Hennessey's car ready.

596
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:55,647
Edward.

597
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:00,086
Did she seem all right when
you picked her up from the airport?

598
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,206
- How do you mean?
- I don't know, normal?

599
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:04,206
Yes, I'd say so.

600
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:07,206
She's very up and down,
very skittish and manic.

601
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:10,328
I guess she did seem nervous.
We didn't talk much.

602
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:15,567
- I'll get her.
- I'll be outside.

603
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,887
Megan?

604
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:27,127
I've got it.

605
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,247
Really, I'm OK.

606
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,486
The car's ready,
whenever you are.

607
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:47,846
- Thank you for everything.
- Have a safe flight. I'll be in touch.

608
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,126
I just had a very productive
interview with Ms. Dunbar.

609
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:39,127
- Send out the press release.
- Thank you very much.

610
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,646
- You OK, ma'am?
- I'm fine. I just dropped...

611
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:57,246
- Please, let me.
- Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.

612
00:38:57,247 --> 00:39:00,007
- I've got it. You're barefoot.
- Edward, you don't have to. Really.

613
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:03,326
- Oh, no, what happened?
- Damn it.

614
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:06,326
- Let me get some bandages.
- You don't have to.

615
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:09,086
No, I want to. Stay here.

616
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:11,926
The coverage has been
mostly positive so far.

617
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:15,806
- Dunbar's office? - All they've said is
they look forward to reviewing logs.

618
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:18,686
- Any heat on Doug?
- Some.

619
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:21,005
I'm getting a lot
of requests for comments.

620
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:24,566
I acted on my own and will fully cooperate
with the Justice Department.

621
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:27,566
- We can put that out?
- Sir?

622
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:31,966
- It might generate more interest.
- On me, not the vice president.

623
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:34,366
- I can handle whatever comes my way.
- Put it out.

624
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:38,207
I'll print you out the most
recent clips too, sir.

625
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:47,606
- Should I find a way to tip off Dunbar?
- Let nature take its course.

626
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:49,965
We got ahold of Remy.
He just got back to town.

627
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:52,686
- Where is he? - I've arranged
everything with your detail.

628
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:58,087
- You've done good work, Doug.
- Thank you, sir.

629
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,086
There, that's much better.

630
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,047
Thanks, ma'am.

631
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:07,565
I'm gonna get going.

632
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:13,047
- I'm sorry, I'm a little drunk.
- It's your house. You can
do whatever you want.

633
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:15,886
You should have a glass of wine.

634
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:17,566
I appreciate that,
ma'am, but I...

635
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:20,766
- You're off your shift, right?
- I am. That's true.

636
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:24,606
Then I won't
take no for an answer.

637
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,246
You shouldn't waste any
of your good stuff on me. I'm...

638
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:31,006
I don't really know
anything about wine.

639
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:35,046
Then how about bourbon?
I bet you'd like a little of that.

640
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:37,806
I definitely don't mind a
bourbon from time to time.

641
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:39,807
Then bourbon it is.

642
00:41:54,766 --> 00:41:58,405
You're a tough man
to track down these days.

643
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:01,485
You got the watch?

644
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,285
"To improve is to change."

645
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:05,886
"To perfect is
to change often."

646
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,726
What sort of change
are you looking for?

647
00:42:07,727 --> 00:42:13,125
- Whichever leaves me options.
- Trouble at Glendon Hill?

648
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:15,725
Paid leave until the
investigation is over.

649
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:17,526
Well, at least
you're being paid.

650
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:20,685
First step in terminating
my partnership.

651
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:22,485
You know how things go.

652
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:25,485
No matter what happens,
there's a stain I can't wash out.

653
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:28,726
So you're looking
for career opportunities.

654
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:31,205
I'm not offering myself
to you wholesale.

655
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:34,526
I keep fighting you,
but I can fight you less.

656
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:39,326
- And by "less" you mean...
- Enough to hurt, but not finish you.

657
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:42,288
And in return, I have a future
beyond Glendon Hill.

658
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:44,965
- Whatever that might look like.
- So you're offering neutrality.

659
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:48,805
- But you'll go with the victor.
- I figure let the best man win.

660
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:55,245
And if you go down, it won't be
because of me. That's worth something.

661
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:59,607
- Where's this coming from?
- Insurance, that's all.

662
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:04,407
Does it have anything to do
with Jackie?

663
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:12,046
That's over.

664
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,846
I know you've got Birch
in your pocket. Womack's not an option.

665
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:18,565
We're too close.
But Jacqueline...

666
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:21,726
This is about my future,
pure and simple. She's not a part of it.

667
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:28,046
Keep the watch,
as a token of good faith.

668
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,006
He might deny it,
but he's protecting her.

669
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:41,726
What he doesn't realize
is that I have even less regard

670
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:44,925
for Jackie than Raymond does.
Poor Remy.

671
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:50,367
The heart can choke the mind
when all its blood flows back unto itself.

672
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:46,327
He said, "I don't like
brunettes."

673
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:55,205
Looks like
I almost missed the party.

674
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:58,725
- I'm off the clock, sir.
- Oh, relax.

675
00:44:58,726 --> 00:45:02,925
Francis, I broke a glass and
Edward cut his hand on a piece of it.

676
00:45:02,926 --> 00:45:06,006
- Jesus!
- Oh, wow, it needs a change.

677
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:09,567
Take that off
and I'll get fresh...

678
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:17,445
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I was off duty...

679
00:45:17,446 --> 00:45:22,406
- Is she...?
- Drunk? A little.

680
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:28,725
- How many of these have you had?
- A few.

681
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,967
More than a few.

682
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:39,446
- May I? Mm.
- Please.

683
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:46,486
Let me see.

684
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:48,486
It's not too bad.

685
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:56,006
- There's a lot of blood.
- Looks worse than it is.

686
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,646
Ow...

687
00:45:59,647 --> 00:46:03,206
- Is it painful?
- The bourbon helps.

688
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:08,567
You let me know if this hurts.

689
00:46:12,366 --> 00:46:13,886
Not one bit, sir.

690
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:49,525
- How's your head?
- Fine.

691
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:52,645
I took a couple of aspirin
before I went to sleep.

692
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:54,967
You?

693
00:48:56,086 --> 00:48:58,686
I slept like a baby.

694
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,726
Good.

695
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:02,766
You needed that.

696
00:49:16,846 --> 00:49:18,966
- What is it?
- Something weird.

697
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,045
- This one address keeps popping up.
- Underwood?

698
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:23,046
The president.

699
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:39,246
- Good morning, Meechum.
- Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

700
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:43,045
It's a beautiful day.

702
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,056
