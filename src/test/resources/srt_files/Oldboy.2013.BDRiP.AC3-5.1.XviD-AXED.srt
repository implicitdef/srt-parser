Make this happen.
Make this happen, all right?

Yes, sir.

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,045
What about that new place?

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,925
Oh, girl, I gotta go. Bye.

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,169

- Oh, and this one, your ex-wife...

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,167
...Donna Hawthorne?
She's really pissed.

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,647
- She's always pissed.
- I don't blame her.

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,930
Damn.

- Good.

22
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,729
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, let me take a look at those.

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,321
- Watch the fight?
- I didn't. I was working.

24
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,006
Talk to me about Newcombe.
Are you gonna bag him?

25
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,131
- This is a make it or break it for us.
- Got dinner tonight at the Pinnacle.

26

- Pinnacle? Expensive.
- Yup.

27
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,367
Necessary.

28
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,522
- All right, reel him in.
- I always do.

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,088
If you don't, we're fucked.
Now, let me make this very clear.

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,645
- If you don't...
I'm_

31
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,041
...you're fucked.
- Got it. I got the deal.

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,410
Clean yourself up a little bit. Put on
your best suit. Wear cologne, smell good.

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,245
- Aramis. That chickie of his likes you.
- Loveit

34
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,126

Boxing.

36

<i>- Yeah, Joe Doucett.

- What can I do for you?
- You know what day this is?

39
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,411
Yes, I do. It's the 8th of October...

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,527
...the year of our Lord 1993, which means
that I'm late with my child support again.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,007
That is not why I'm calling, you know it.

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,410
<i>I asked you to come to Mia's party three
weeks ago, you never called me back.</i>

43
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,688
- Well, I can't make it, Donna.
- Why not?

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,130
<i>- Because I have a big client dinner.
- Well, that's way more important...</i>

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,285
<i>...than your daughter's birthday.
- Listen, she is 3 years old, okay?</i>

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,122
Three years old, okay? Do you think
she cares whether I'm there or not?

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,685
You know what, Joe?

48
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,008
As a husband, as a father...

49
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,808
...you are a fucking joke!
- You know what? You're a bitch, Donna.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,367
- What did you say?
- You're a fucking bitch!

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,847

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,568
I've gotta make a call.
Please excuse me.

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,291
You gotta do business

Thank you, Judy. I don't think
I could've done that without you.

70
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,766
Oh, sure you could've.

71
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,362
Laughing at all my jokes,
telling him what great ideas I have.

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,887
- They are great ideas.
- I appreciate that.

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,051
From one bullshit artist to another.
Listen.

74
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,080
I was thinking,
what do you say you and I...

75
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,563
...we get together this weekend,
ditch the old man...

76
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,445
...bottle of Scotch, eight ball of coke...

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,969
...dirty movies on Skinemax?

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,441
- Excuse me?
- What?

79
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,802
Let me get this straight.

80
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,608
You think I said those things
because I wanna fuck you?

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,444
- Yeah.
- No.

82
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,291
- No?
- No. I wanna get out of here...

83
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,007
...and away from you
as fast as humanly possible.

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,409
- Daniel likes you, God knows why.
- Okay.

85
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,802
- But, Joe?
- Yeah?

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,047
You're a dick.

87
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,527
And I would rather fuck a corpse.

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,085
Joe.

89
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,448
- You wanna disrespect me?
- No. I didn't...

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,325
- That's all right.
- It was just a misunderstanding.

91
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,921
I'm a big boy. I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

92
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,241
Okay.

93
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,683
But you disrespect the woman I love,
son, that's...

94
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,003
- That's just plain stupid.
- It was just a misunderstanding.

95
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,603
Let's go, baby.

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,651
He's not worth the trouble.

97
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,204
I'm dry!

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,368
Does anybody have any more alcohol?

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
Shut the fuck up!

100
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,762
Does anyone have more alcohol?

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,371
I can't...

102

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,806
Hello?

161
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,371
Fuck!

162
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,926
Hello?

163
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,441
Hey. He)'-

164
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,361
Tell me why I'm here. Tell... No, listen.

165
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,807
Tell me why I'm here. No, no, no.

166
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,405
Dumplings. Anything but dumplings.

167
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,609
Please.

168
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,167
Please can I have something else
to eat?

169
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,045
Jesus H. Christ, God love you...

170
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,249
...give me something
other than this crap.

171
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,362
<i>We're gonna squeeze for two...</i>

172
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,848
<i>...and then we're gonna open for two.
Make sure you resist it.</i>

173
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>This is a great way to tone
and strengthen your upper legs.</i>

174
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,322
<i>And we all know that's an area
that often gets neglected.</i>

175
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,842
<i>So, if you haven't already,
join with me now.</i>

176
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,650
<i>And squeeze.</i>

177
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,406
<i>Come on, and up. Good.</i>

178
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,523
<i>- Can you feel the burn?
- Yes.</i>

179
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,046
<i>- And release.
- Release.</i>

180
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,366
Here we go.

181
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,800
- And...
- Squeeze.

182
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,047
<i>And release.</i>

183
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,766
<i>- Let's go, keep going. Squeeze.
Squeeze.</i>

184
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,041
<i>And up.</i>

185
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,090
<i>Now we're gonna speed it up.</i>

186
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,049
Oh, yeah.

187
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,365
<i>- Good. Feel it.
- I am.</i>

188
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,323
<i>Good, and open.</i>

189
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,649
<i>Good, and squeeze. And...</i>

190
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,326
<i>Good. Squeeze.</i>

191
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,651
<i>And open.</i>

192
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,291
<i>Squeeze.</i>

193
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,970
<i>And open.</i>

194
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,611
<i>There she is.</i>

195
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,651
<i>I owe you one.</i>

196
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,241
<i>Early this morning, the body
of single mother Donna Hawthorne...</i>

197
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,886
<i>...was discovered
in her Southside apartment.</i>

198
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,688
<i>Police confirmed that she was raped
and savagely beaten to death.</i>

199
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,966
<i>The victim was the mother
of a 3-year-old girl...</i>

200
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,403
<i>...who was inside the apartment
at the time of the killing.</i>

201
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,401
<i>To quote forensic investigators:</i>

202
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,843
<i>The evidence is irrefutable.</i>

203
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,648
<i>Prime suspect Joseph Doucett
was the victim's former husband...</i>

204
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,049
<i>...and father of the surviving child.</i>

205
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,404
<i>That's all from Stephanie Lee,
here on the scene. Back to you, Michael.</i>

206
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,281
<i>Remember...</i>

207
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,326
<i>...your enemy is most vulnerable
just before he strikes.</i>

208
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,051
<i>This area is extremely dangerous.
Don't let your guard down for a second.</i>

209
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,488
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

210
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,569
<i>This is really big.</i>

211
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,560
<i>We need to think about
what our next move will be.</i>

212
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,280
<i>We must figure out a plan
and execute it.</i>

213
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,290
<i>More importantly,
we need to get you two together.</i>

214
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,122
<i>- You have to speak with him.
- Unfortunately, it didn't work.</i>

215
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,604
<i>He's still alive.</i>

216
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,565
<i>We're going to have to try
something else.</i>

217
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,963
<i>I don't know. That seems risky.</i>

218
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,484
<i>If those two guys
are who we think they are...</i>

219
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,524
<i>- I am sorry.
- Six, seven, eight.</i>

220
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,361
<i>Up, down.
Let's take it down, down, slow.</i>

224
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
<i>That's it, bring it up.</i>

225

<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

226

<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

227
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,889
<i>Arch your back. That's it.</i>

228
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>That's it.</i>

229
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,882
<i>Recover before we get back into it.</i>

230
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,686
<i>I, William Jefferson Clinton,
do solemnly swear...</i>

Don't ever leave me.

I won't touch your babies.

I'll keep you nice and comfy here.

Yes, you protect those babies.

<i>Donna Hawthorne is brutally raped
and beaten to death...</i>

<i>What can you tell us about Mia?</i>

<i>We adopted Mia

<i>Neither her mother

- No.</i>

<i>Tonight...</i>

<i>And your father?</i>

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,850
<i>I don't remember him, either.</i>

345
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,526
<i>- I'm sorry, that's not what I was asking.
- I hate him for what he did.</i>

346
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,281
<i>No, there's a part of me
that hates him for what he did...</i>

Stop.

Please!

372
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,248
Let him know I stopped by, all right?

373
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,449
Hey. Where is she?

374
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,726
Tell me where she is!

375
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,684
- Don't hurt me!
- Where is she?

376
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,166
Hey! Let him go!

377
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,050
Jesus, let go of him!

Jesus, Johnny, are you okay?

379
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,290
If you wanna see the doctor,
respect the rules, okay?

380
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,323
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

381
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,807
- I thought he was someone else.
- You okay?

382
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,487
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

383
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,844
That must be yours. Johnny takes things
that don't belong to him sometimes.

384
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,329
I'm really sorry about that.
Hey, I'm Dr. Tom Melby. I run the clinic.

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,611
Johnny, can we give Mr. Doakes
his umbrella back?

387
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,006
- Please?
- No.

388
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,282
- No, he can keep it.
- You sure?

389
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,371
Sir? Joe?

390
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,044
Sorry. If you think that you might need
any medical help...

391
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,049

If you just wanna talk to someone,
my name is Marie Sebastian.

393

Please, take that.

394

<i>Twenty years in the same room?</i>

403

<i>Jesus Christ,
I would have lost my mind.</i>

404

Why?

405
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,368
Why would somebody do that to you?
What could you have possibly done?

406
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,206
Here, I think you could use this.

407
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,445
- No, I'm fine with coffee.
- Well, what are you gonna do, Joe?

408
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,441
<i>- Hello?

422
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,283
<i>Perhaps with that lovely daughter

423
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,649
<i>- Mia has nothing to do with this.

424
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,368
Was that him? Let me see.

425
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,523
Blocked. What'd he say?

Okay, Daniel Newcombe.

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,005
Probably gonna be a lot

We can take him off the list.

You know, if you don't mind me saying,
that's a very long list.

Why is he on the list?

441
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,284
Because he was my boss.
Is there an address?

442
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,249
- Yeah. This guy?
- Okay.

Just write it in there?

Yeah. You write whatever you want

Yeah, he'll be fine.
He just needs to rest.

460
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,849
Guy's exhausted.
He's also malnourished and dehydrated.

461
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,050
What happened to him?

462
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,011
He showed up last night
completely out of the blue.

463
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,165
I haven't seen the guy in 20 years.
I didn't even recognize him at first.

464
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,524
Comes inside, we sit down,
he starts telling me this crazy story.

465
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,324
What's the story?

466
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,485
- How do you know him?
- I don't.

467
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,967
- You don't.
- Well, what's the story?

468
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,731
I said enough already.
I don't know who you are.

469
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,651
- Come on, Chucky! It's 9:00 already!
- Shit.

470
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,330
Okay, I gotta open the joint.

471
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,850
Okay. I'm gonna stick around
and make sure he's all right for a while.

472
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,642
Hold your horses.

473
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,442
<i>Dear daughter, dear Mia...</i>

474
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,766
<i>...I have been unjustly held in this
god-awful place for almost 20 years.</i>

475
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,487
<i>When I'm free of this place,
and I will be free of it...</i>

476
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,887
<i>...my purpose will be simple and pure.</i>

477
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,367
<i>I intend to prove my love for you.</i>

478
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,000
<i>To do this,
I must find the man who put me here.</i>

479
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,247
<i>I am your father.</i>

480
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,771
<i>Now it is my duty...</i>

481
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,008
<i>...now it is my responsibility...</i>

482
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,446
<i>...to take care of you.</i>

483
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,723
<i>To love you, Mia.
Please give me that chance.</i>

484
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,285
<i>The world can be a cold, ugly place,
and people can be cruel and deceitful.</i>

485
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,687
<i>But never let that change who you are.</i>

486
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,049
<i>One day I will be there
to share it with you.</i>

487
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,891
<i>Love, Daddy.</i>

488
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,765
You read them?

489
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,883
You read my letters?

490
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,003
You had no right!

491
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,043
Who the fuck are you?

492
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,846
Chucky called me
because you were in bad shape.

493
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,647
- I'm all right now, you can get out.
- No, you're far from all right.

494
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,649
What are you doing here?

495
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,885
I apologize for reading your letters.

496
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,525
You didn't call the police?

497
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,768
- No, I didn't.
- Why?

498
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,290
- I believe you.
- Why?

499
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,243
I believe that you've been locked up
for a long time.

500
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,407
Okay? I believe you want to be a father
to your daughter.

501
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,726
Don't touch me.

502
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,321
And that you want to prove your love
to her.

503
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,171
- Okay.
- I said, don't touch me.

504
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,686
Okay.

505
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,247
What if I thought
you knew too much, huh?

506
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,562
Reading my letters.

507
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,647
What if I felt
like I needed to kill you right now?

508
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,851
Then I suppose I'd be dead.

509
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,085
Joe...

510
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,001
...please take your hands off me.

511
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,167
If you are trying to find your daughter...

512
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,127
...and clear your name, I could help you.
Or let me take you to people who can.

513
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,847
There are social workers, legal aid,
even cops I trust.

514
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,247
No, I don't need your help.

515
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,206
Bernard Sharkey.

516
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,404
Bernard. He's up the stairs.
It's nice of y'all to come.

517
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,364
He doesn't get many visitors.

518
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,450
- Thank you.
- Bye. Enjoy.

519
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,762
Sorry, boss.

520
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,522
- How do you know that's not him?
- He seems happy.

521
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,049
The one who called me doesn't know
what happy means.

522
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,411
- What?
- I need Yellow Pages.

523
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,206
- Where are all the payphones?
- No. Okay. Hold on.

524
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,488
- What are you looking for?
- A restaurant.

525
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,211
- Okay.
- It's called Dragon something.

526
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,249
There. Here.

527
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,284
- Five dollar.
- Sir, buy something for your girlfriend.

528
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,847
Only $5.

529
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,042
Buy anything, $5.

530
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,730
I have to go.
I have a shift, I can't just not show up.

531
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,530
I put my number in your phone.

532
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,007
<i>- I'll be free all day tomorrow.
- Thank you.</i>

533
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,050
- The usual, sir?
- Yep. Thank you.

534
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,848
- Yeah.
- Put it on the bill.

535
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,327
Have a good day. See you tomorrow.

536
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,968
Where's my next order?

537
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,240
Sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir!

538
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,166
<i>Hey-</i>

539
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,571
You know the drill. Put it on the table.

540
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,089
Thirty-nine across.
"Alter ego of Edmond Dantés. "

541
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,845
The Count of Monte Cristo.

542
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,484
Hello. It's time to feed the pets.

543
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,684
F- O-O-D. F-O-O-D.

544
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,845
Goddamn,
these motherfuckers don't do shit.

545
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,168
Hey, what's up with the...?

546
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,523
Let me up out of here, motherfucker. Me
and you, man-to-man. Come on. Let's go.

547
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,046
Shit.

548
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,447
You want some get back,
then let me get up.

549
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,490
Me and you can go at it, motherfucker.
How about it?

550
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,727
Hold still.

551
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,329
What the fuck are you doing?

552
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,609
What the fuck are you doing?

553
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,611
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up.

554
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,282
There we go.

555
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,161
Are you ready?

556
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,762
Might wanna think about
what you're doing.

557
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,045
I've been thinking about it
for the last 20 years.

558
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,931
- Wait. What...?
- Hold still.

559
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,326
Cocksucker.

560
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,762
Motherfucker.

561
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,526
Shit.

562
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,683
You no dick, ass-licking son of a bitch!

563
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,928
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

564
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,043
You booger-eating,
piss-drinking motherfucker.

565
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,811
If you stop now,
you may get out of here alive.

566
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,882
I'm gonna keep going...

567
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,323
...till I can pull your head off
with my bare hands.

568
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,760
Okay?

569
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,611
Listen to me. Listen to me.

570
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,531
I only run this place, all right?

571
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,166
I was hired to keep you here.

572
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,407
Who hired you?

573
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,806
- I can't tell you that.
- Then do me a favor...

574
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,088
...and shut the fuck up.

575
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,920
Who hired you?

576
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,408
I don't know his fucking name!

577
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,406
- Who hired you?
- No, no, no.

578
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,289
I swear. I swear it's the truth.

579
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,450
It's the truth. I never ask their names.

580
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,081
They never tell.

581
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,287
Oh, goddamn you, motherfucker!

582
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,688
God...! Oh, goddamn!

583
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,841
Oh, no. Oh, please. Please.

584
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,523
- I know you're gonna tell me something.
- I don't know shit.

585
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,520
I swear before God and eight
motherfucking white people, all right?

586
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,200
- Look. Look.
- No, no, no.

587
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,880
No, no, no.

588
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,849
- The tapes. The tapes.
- Where?

589
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,526
Over there in the cabinet. Go, look.

590
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,450
First one. Right there.
Go look. Right there.

591
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,449
Right there, right there.

592
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,369
First cabinet.

593
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,086
Second shelf, third tray, first cassette.

594
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That one. That one.

00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,964
"Tape one. Doucett. "

596
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,323
Go ahead, play it. Listen to it.

597
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,481
I don't know who he is.
I never get names.

598
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,330
I swear.

599
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,327
<i>Sir, for a very long time, we have served
a very elite group of clients.</i>

600
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,683
<i>Now, I surmise that you've encountered
one such individual.</i>

601
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,247
<i>That's the only way
you received this number.</i>

602
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,801
<i>Correct.</i>

603
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,444
Sir, this business existed
long before my tenure...

604
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,530
...and will continue long after I'm gone.

605

607
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,603
- You've convinced me.
- Good.

608
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,768
How long will we have the pleasure...

609
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,726
...of entertaining this Mr. Doucett
as a guest?

Get your asses up here now.

612
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,051
Open the door!

613
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,810
'See?

614
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,126
I told you.

615

Well, do we?

616
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,764
- You tell those motherfuckers...
- Tell them what?

617
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,449
Get the fuck away from the door!

Get away from the door.

Son of a bitch.

629
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,891
Fuck!

630
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,523
Oh, my God.

631
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,161
You must take care of yourself.

632
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,124
The fun is only just beginning.

633
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,165
Joe.

634
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,686
What the fuck happened?

635
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,086
Come on.

636
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,560
Come on, Joe.

637
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,527
Hello?

638
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,686
Marie, he needs to stay down
for at least a week.

639
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,726
Keep movement to a minimum because
we don't wanna tear out those sutures.

640
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,845
He lost a lot of blood, but if he
stays down, he should be all right.

641
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,651
Half a centimeter difference
on some lacerations...

642
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,848
...it could've been a different story.

643
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,328
I really appreciate this, Tom.

644
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,000
You should let me take him
to the hospital.

645
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,362
- Well, you can't.
- Why not?

646
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,244
Somebody tried to kill him. Isn't that
something we should call the police over?

647
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,482
Well, I'm asking you not to.

648
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,287
He isn't a stray dog
or a bird with a broken wing, Marie.

649
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,608
I know that you love your lost causes...

650
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,361
...but sometimes we meet people
who can get us to engage in old thinking.

651
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,326
So, what, you think I'm using again?
Is that what you think?

652
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,250
Fuck you.

653
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,404
Come in.

654
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,166
Hey. Just wanted to see
if you were feeling all right.

655
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:20,801
I just wanna take a look at that wound
on your back really quickly, if that's okay.

656
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,764
Just turn around here.

657
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,610
Sorry.

658
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,446
Okay.

659
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,528
Well, it looks like the bleeding
has stopped, so that's a good sign.

660
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,248
I can't tell you what to do.
And I can't tell Marie either.

661
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,289
But I can tell you this.
She's been through a lot.

662
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,690
And if there's one thing that she doesn't
need any more of from anyone...

663
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,370
...it's pain.

664
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,761
Please don't hurt her.

665
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,803
He likes you.

666
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,727
Do you like him?

667
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:14,767
No. That was a long time ago.

668
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,006
Well, he still likes you.

669
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,845
I got your suit cleaned for you.

670
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,403
They didn't...
They didn't patch up the hole.

671
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,210
Can I help you? Here.

672
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,683
Well, I think you should go.

673
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,402
Come on, go.

674
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,929
Come on, get out of here.

675
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,210
- Go.
- Are you serious?

676
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,324
Don't come back. Go.

677
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,170
Come on, go.

678
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,408
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
last call for alcohol.

679
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,890
Speak up or forever hold your peace.

680
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,730
Hello?

681
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,210
Hello.

682
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,567
Hello. I thought it was time we met.

683
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,326
Hey!

684
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,884
Hey! What the...?

685
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,447
- Cool. Be cool.
- All right, all right.

686
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,206
Kill me now...

687
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,844
...and die seconds later
never knowing why.

688
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,886
Stop it!

689
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,686
I have your daughter.

690
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,008
If you'd like to see her alive again...

691
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,811
...I hope we can continue
without the violence.

692
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,483
May I see your list?

693
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,930
No.

694
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,964
It's of no use to you, trust me.

695
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,886
I have a proposition for you, Joseph.

696
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,405
If you should accept and succeed,
you will be greatly rewarded.

697
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,321
Firstly, with a video tape recording...

698
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,444
...of the rape and murder of your wife...

699
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,768
...Donna Hawthorne.
- No! No!

700
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,325
Oh, God, no.

701
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,368
- No. I don't wanna watch it.
- No!

702
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,449
<i>- Please.
- Turn it off.</i>

703
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,087
<i>Say goodbye. Say goodbye.</i>

704
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,691
- Turn it off. Turn it off.
- Very well.

705
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:30,127
Secondly,
my handwritten confession...

706
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,691
...to that crime
and your kidnapping and imprisonment.

707
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,922
Thirdly, and this is my favorite one...

708
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,609
...20 million dollars in diamonds.

709
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:51,567
Lastly, and again,
this is only if you should succeed...

710
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,931
...I will put a bullet through my brain...

711
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,367
...and you can watch.

712
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,801
Answer two questions.

713
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,770
One, who am I?

714
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:11,729
And two,
why did I imprison you for 20 years?

715
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,290
If you provide satisfactory answers
to both of these questions...

716
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:21,924
...in little more than 46 hours from now,
you win.

717
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,807
Refusal of the challenge
brings the same result as failure.

718
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,287
You stay a fugitive from justice...

719
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,326
...you get no reward, no closure...

720
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,444
...and I kill your daughter.

721
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,331
If you or anyone you know
should go to the police...

722
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,723
...or try to warn Mia,
the consequences will be severe.

723
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,365
Especially for her.

724
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,484
If you doubt the extent of my will
or my reach...

725
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,526
...I suggest you look in
on your friend Marie.

726
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,244
That is a live broadcast.
My proposition, yes or no?

727
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,167
Yes.

728
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,160
It's 629 Cooper Street,
and you'd better hurry.

729
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,250
Marie.

730
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,123
Marie. Marie.

731
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,970
Hey, Joe.

732
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,650
I was gonna let Cortez here
have some fun with her.

733
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,320
But now that you're here...

734
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,927
...the bitch can wait.

735
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,041
- Let's get him up on the table.
- Come on.

736
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,130
Let's go. Let's go.

737
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,727
Pull him up.

738
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,605
The last person
that got the better of me...

739
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,604
...I tracked her funky ass down...

740
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,044
...and tortured her for 16 fucking days.

741
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,449
Now, compared
to what I'm about to do to you...

742
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,962
...that was like an ant
fucking an elephant.

743
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,405
Yes?

744
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,969
I'm afraid I can't do that.

745
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,925
Reparations must be made.

746
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,206
Indeed it was you
who gave me this address...

747
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,164
...and I appreciate that, but...

748
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,407
No. No, there's nothing you can give me
that will stop me...

749
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,331
"Go to the door. "

750
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,611
Cortez.

751
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,484
Cortez.

752
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,285
Move.

753
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,562
Oh, well, maybe I can...

754
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,523
- I thank you for your generosity, sir.
- Damn.

755
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,486
And thank you
for appreciating my sacrifice.

756
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,522
Yes, sir. You have a good evening too.

757
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,204
You are a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

758
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,686
Let's go.

759
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,125
I'm sorry.

760
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,888
I'm sorry.

761
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,884
Hey. Hey. He)'-

762
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,646
It's okay. It's okay.

763
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:08,364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

764
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,482
I have a friend downtown, so I can...

765
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,043
I can stay with her.
I don't feel safe here anymore.

766
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,529
Hello?

767
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,362
Every time he calls,
the same music plays.

768
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,121
Evergreen Academy.

769
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,922
Have you ever heard of that?

770
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,570
The prep school I went to.

771
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,084
This is so weird, I can't find anything.

772
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,123
Here's something.

773
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,720
Who's Edwina Burke?

774
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,004
She was the headmistress.
She might know something.

775
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,328
I used to drink a lot.

776
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,125
Yeah, well, I used to drink, and I also
did a shitload of other stuff, but...

777
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,526
Tonight was actually... It was the first time
that I wanted to use again.

778
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,487
I'm glad you're here.

779
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,607
Miss Burke?
Edwina Burke from Evergreen Academy?

780
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,050
- Yes.
- I was wondering if I could talk to you...

781
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,965
...about a former student? Joe Doucett.

782
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,921
<i>- Come'm.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.</i>

783
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,370
<i>Not at all. I was just making some tea.
Please, sit.</i>

784
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,844
<i>Joseph Deuce.</i>

785
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,051
- Do you remember him?
- Of course.

786
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:54,406
We had many students gain notoriety,
but he was our only murderer.

787
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,008
- Thank God.
- Well, what if I told you...

788
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,966
...that Joe Doucett is innocent
and another man killed his wife?

789
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,401
Someone he knew at Evergreen.

790
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,967
Why don't you tell me who you are?

791
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,848
I'm sorry. My name's Marie Sebastian.

792
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,805
Have you heard
of the Innocence Project?

793
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,329
The Innocence Project
works with convicted felons.

794
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,410
Joseph disappeared 20 years ago.

795
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,923
Excuse me.

796
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,243
You really think he didn't do it?

797
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,683
We have evidence
that suggests he was framed.

798
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,405
That comes as some relief.

799
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,126
He was a very handsome boy.

800
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,688
Terrible student,
but Donna adored him...

801
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,207
...but he never appreciated that or her.

802
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,802
He was the kind of boy
who thought very highly of himself...

803
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,206
...and no one else.

804
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,366
In fact, he could be quite cruel
to the others.

805
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,086
Always with a grin, as if it were a joke.

806
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,522
I always felt he was a bit of a lost soul.

807
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,848
You said you thought
it might be another student?

808
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,251
- I'm assuming Joe had enemies?
- Many.

809
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,047
But for one to do something so horrible?

810
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,483
That would require
a very deep level of hatred.

811
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,967
Well, was there someone?

812
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,127
Anyone like that?

813
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,683
I honestly don't remember.

814
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,046
I drove by the academy this morning.

815
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,800
What happened?

816
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,286
They took it from him.

817
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,211
My father built it brick by brick.

818
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,768
The board of directors sold it
to some faceless corporation...

819
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,123
...and the gates have been locked
ever since.

820
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,526
It's all still there.

821
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,645
Files, records,
the entire history of the school...

822
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,326
."abandoned.

823
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,520
- Bye.
- Marie.

824
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:17,521
When you first arrived,
you said you believe Joe is innocent...

825
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,245
...not was.

826
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,130
I assumed he was dead.

827
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,249
Thank you.

828
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,610
God, you went to school here?

829
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,040
A long time ago.

830
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,001
- Let's come back tonight.
- Okay.

831
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,807
- Hello?
- I didn't know him back then.

832
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,809
I don't even recognize the name.

833
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,968
Your friends? Maybe they know him.

834
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,801
I haven't seen those assholes in years.
I doubt they'd talk to me.

835
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,924
I hated everything
about that fucking place, except you.

836
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,249
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

837
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,442
Let me see what I can find out. Okay?

838
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,165
All right.

839
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,729
We should change your bandage.

840
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,084
- Need help?
- Yeah, please.

841
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,124
Sister?

842
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,563
<i>The party you have called
is not available. Leave a message.</i>

843
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,083
<i>Joe, it's Chucky.
Call me as soon as you get this.</i>

844
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,205
<i>It's not about him, it's about her.
The whore, remember?</i>

845
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,562
<i>Jesus, Joe, call me.</i>

846
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,331
Chucky?

847
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,806
Chucky?

848
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,209
You called her a whore.

849
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,442
You called her a whore!

850
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,930
Whore! Whore! Whore!

851
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,727
Adrian Pryce. Adrian Pryce.

852
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,649
I got it.

from the Pryce family, Amanda Pryce. "

855
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,689
Will you check for Amanda?

856
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,524
Nineteen eighty-six.

857
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,444
I got it.

858
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,644
Amanda Pryce.

860
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,601
Do you remember her?

861
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,045
Now, hold on.

862
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,369
Freshwomen should be in their rooms.
This is a serious infraction.

863
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,444
- Give it back to me.
- Hey, Joe, leave her alone.

864
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,211
- If she wants to go, let her go.
- Donna, shut up.

865
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,609
This is sexy. Very sexy. Huh, Chucky?

866
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,083
- Give it back to me.
- What a fucking freak.

867
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,569
- Here, douche bag.
- Disgusting.

868
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,486
- Hey.
- Come on.

869
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,320
Joe, let her through.

Come on, let her go.

- Really?
- That bitch.

873
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,045
Chucky, shut the fuck up.

874
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,887
- You gonna let her talk to me like that?
- I don't care, I'm drunk.

875
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,047
Now, let's get back.

876
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,726
I can't be missed.

877
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,643
Here you go.

878
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,211
There.

879

That's him.
The man in the greenhouse that night.

887
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,404
He was her father.

888

Chucky, where are you? Call me.

889

If he kills you,
you're not gonna see your daughter.

890

Okay? And if you kill him...

Please.

895
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,448
I don't want you to go.

There.

910
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,247
Where? Where is she?

911
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,324
Here.

912
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,528
Quite close by, actually.

913

Please put that away.
She will suffer great pain if you do not.

916
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,849
Your reward.

917
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,170
As I said, I'm a man of my word.

918

So who am I?

919
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,844
Adrian Doyle Pryce.

920
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,040
Why did I imprison you for 20 years?

921
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,084
- You blame me for what happened.
- Elaborate.

922
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:14,320
I saw your sister with a man,
down at the greenhouse.

923
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,007
"They were fucking.
They were fucking. "

924
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,408
- Isn't that what you told everyone?
- Yes.

925
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,322
I told Donna.

926
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,161
I told Chucky, I told half of Evergreen.

927
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,487
Gossip spreads like the plague.

928
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,763
- Amanda's a whore! Whore! Whore!
- Stop it!

929
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,766
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Leave me alone!

930
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,526
- Chucky! Stop it now!
- Whore! Whore! Whore!

931
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,166
- Chucky! Stop it now!
- I didn't do anything!

932
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,684
You have no idea how difficult it was
for Amanda then.

933
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:54,044
The torture that she endured,
all because of you.

934
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,766
Continue.

935
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,645
I didn't know it was your father
until today.

936
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:04,201
The school must have found out
what was going on...

937
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,325
...and he got your family out of the States
as fast as possible.

938
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,569
I'm only guessing,
but running didn't help.

939
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,922
He must've been afraid
of what was coming.

940
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,124
You know nothing of my father.

941
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,126
He knew no fear, only love.

942
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,562
Arthur Pryce was a great man.

943
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,367
He will always be a great man.

944
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,082
What we had together...

945
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,287
...was beautiful and special and pure.

946
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,722
<i>My father did what he did
to honor and preserve that.</i>

947
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,764
Father.

948
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,563
Father.

949
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,286
Daddy.

950
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,409
<i>My father loved my mother.</i>

951
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,483
Daddy.

952
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,483
<i>He loved my sister.</i>

953
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,845
<i>And he loved me.</i>

954
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:24,483
You see, Joseph,
my sister Amanda and I thought...

955
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,564
...that what we had with my father
would last forever.

956
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,885
That nobody could take it from us.

957
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,371
And yet, you did.

958
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,524
And, yes...

959
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,047
...that is why I imprisoned you
for 20 years.

960
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,527
It seems you've won, Mr. Doucett.

961
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,485
Take me to Mia.

962
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,206
Yes, of course.

963
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,800
Do you know what I find fascinating,
Joseph?

964
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,368
All this time,
you never stopped to ask...

965
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,206
...the most fundamental question of all.

966
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,843
Why did I let you go?

967
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,320
Mind your head.

968
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,447
Introducing one of the longest-running
shows on television...

969
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,849
...but it had only a single viewer.

970
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,244
You.

971
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:51,087
<i>We adopted Mia
shortly after the tragedy.</i>

972
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,409
<i>Neither her mother
or this Doucett murderer...</i>

973
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,847
<i>...had any living relatives.</i>

974
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,042
<i>- So we were lucky enough to...
- Blessed.</i>

975
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,480
<i>Yes, we were blessed.</i>

976
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,971
Isn't it amazing?

977
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,846
People just believe whatever they see
on television.

978
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,687
Thank you, Ashley. You can go.

979
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,850
What...?

980
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,921
- Joseph.
- No. No. Mia.

981
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,410
Mia!

982
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,689
Mia!

983
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,689
Oh, Joseph.

984
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,601
Joseph, that is not your daughter.

985
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,962
Ashley is a musician...

986
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,686
...and very well paid actress...

987
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,807
...that I've had in my employ
since she was 10 years old.

988
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,407
Oh, goodness.

989
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,566
Enough with the games.

990
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,842
You tell me where she is. You tell me.

991
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:32,042
Answer the question you never asked.

992
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,611
Why did I let you go?

993
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:41,767
You tell me. You tell me.

994
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,851
You know the answer, Joseph.

995
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,925
In your heart of hearts, you know...

996
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,964
...the plain and simple truth.

997
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,847
- Mia. Mia.
- It took a while...

998
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,244
<i>- Mia. Where are you going?
... to change her name...</i>

999
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,127
...her records...

1000
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,128
...to find the right parents.

1001
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,250
An insensitive mother...

1002
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:30,286
...a loving father
taken from her too soon.

1003
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,804
It took 20 years to create her.

1004
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,723
A sensitive, caring woman...

1005
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,321
...eager to help those in need...

1006
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:45,883
...because she herself had overcome...

1007
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:49,283
...such a troubled past.

1008
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,009
The kind of woman who couldn't help...

1009
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:59,240
...but fall in love with a man like you...

1010
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:03,282
<i>Joseph Deuce..</i>

1011
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,250
No!

1012
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,762
No, no, no! God!

1013
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,089
No, God, no, please, no!

1014
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,490
Please, God, no!

1015
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:35,162
- Joe? Joe?
- No way, no way, no!

1016
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,441
No, no, no.

1017
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,565
No, no, no.
You can't hurt her.

1018
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,086
Who is this?

1019
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,760
Leave her out of it, please. Please.

1020
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,725
- Who is this?
- Please, please, please.

1021
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,206
No, don't hurt her.

1022
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,648
Hurt me. Hurt me.

1023
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,764
Kill me. Yes, yes, yes.

1024
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,281
Yes. Kill me. Please.

1025
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:06,410
- Please kill me.
- I don't want to kill you, Joseph.

1026
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,843
This is why I let you go.

1027
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:19,650
So that I could experience
this moment with you.

1028
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,691
So that you could truly understand
what I had...

1029
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,447
...and what you took from me.

1030
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,925
Heaven make me free of it.

1031
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,442
The rest is silence.

1032
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:19,924
<i>"Dear Marie,
you will never see me again.</i>

1033
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,562
<i>I'm gone from your life forever.</i>

1034
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,971
<i>I have done something terrible.</i>

1035
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,848
<i>Something unforgivable.</i>

1036
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,683
<i>And for it, I must be punished.</i>

1037
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,251
<i>For a short while, I was happy...</i>

1038
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,808
<i>...because of you.</i>

1039
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,451
<i>And I will cherish that happiness forever.</i>

1040
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,926
<i>Marie, I will love you, always.</i>

1041
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,247
<i>But you must forget me.</i>

1042
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,925
<i>Do not waste one more moment
of your life thinking about me.</i>

1043
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,003
<i>I want you to be with someone
who will care for you...</i>

1044
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,323
<i>...watch over you, bring you joy...</i>

1045

<i>...not pain.</i>

1046
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:31,928
<i>I want you to find happiness
with a good man...</i>

<i>...who has a good heart.</i>
