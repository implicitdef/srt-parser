00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,421
You're fighting
to overthrow a king,

156
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,223
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

157
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,858
First we have
to win the war.

158
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,065
You never told me
where you're from.

159
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,467
- Volantis.
- Volantis?

160
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,237
You're far from home.

161
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,539
The boy was lucky
you were here.

162
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,641
He was unlucky
that you were.

163
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,551
You're here to answer for your
brother's latest treasons.

164
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,286
Your Grace,

165
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,622
whatever my traitor brother
has done, I had no part.

166
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:55,124
You know that.
I beg you--

167
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:57,193
Ser Lancel, tell her
of this outrage.

168
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,495
Lancel:
<i>Using some vile sorcery,</i>

169
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,064
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

170
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:02,844
( Crowd murmuring )

171
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,100
Thousands of good men
were butchered.

172
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,639
After the slaughter,
the northmen feasted on

173
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,346
the flesh of the slain.

174
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:11,374
( Crowd gasping, murmuring )

175
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:13,944
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

176
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:17,481
( Crying )

177
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,984
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

178
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,786
Stand.

179
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,181
So we'll have to send
your brother

180
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:27,206
a message some other way.

181
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,562
Meryn.

182
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,200
Leave her face.

183
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,768
I like her pretty.

184
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,173
- ( Blow lands )
- ( Sansa gasps )

185
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,831
( Groans )

186
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,158
Meryn, My Lady
is overdressed.

187
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,780
Unburden her.

188
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,288
If you want Robb Stark
to hear us,

189
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,458
we're going to have
to speak louder.

190
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,726
( Sobbing )

191
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,496
Tyrion: <i>What is the meaning</i>
<i>of this?</i>

192
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,373
What kind of knight
beats a helpless girl?

193
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,575
The kind who serves
his king, Imp.

194
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,043
Careful, now. We don't want

195
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,878
to get blood all over your
pretty white cloak.

196
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,981
Tyrion: Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

197
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,216
She is to be your queen.

198
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,084
Have you no regard
for her honor?

199
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,286
- Joffrey: <i>I'm punishing her.</i>
- Tyrion: <i>For what crimes?</i>

200
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,589
<i>She did not fight her</i>
<i>brother's battle, you half-wit.</i>

201
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:35,192
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

202
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,094
The Mad King
did as he liked.

203
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,565
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told
you what happened to him?

204
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,535
No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

205
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,605
I'm not threatening
the King, Ser.

206
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,206
I am educating my nephew.

207
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,577
Bronn, the next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

208
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,948
That was a threat.
See the difference?

209
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,801
<i>( Crowd whispering )</i>

210
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:20,241
Tyrion: <i>I apologize for</i>
<i>my nephew's behavior.</i>

211
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:21,777
( Crowd murmuring )

212
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:23,207
Tell me the truth.

213
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:25,232
Do you want an end
to this engagement?

214
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:29,252
I am loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

215
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:37,593
Lady Stark, you may
survive us yet.

216
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,031
The little king's
backed up.

217
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:46,434
Clogged from balls
to brains.

218
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:49,170
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

219
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:52,173
There's no cure
for being a cunt.

220
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,475
But the boy's at that age.

221
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,212
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

222
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,782
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

223
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:10,525
What are you
doing here, dog?

224
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,894
Your uncle left
your nameday present

225
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,396
and asked me to see
that you got it.

226
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,968
And?

227
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,103
What is it?

228
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:24,573
Look inside,
Your Grace.

229
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,415
Your Grace.

230
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,319
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

231
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:39,155
We won't tell
if you won't.

232
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,428
No.

233
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,230
Her.

234
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,635
Touch her.

235
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,766
<i>( Women giggle )</i>

236
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:07,717
( Breathing heavily )

237
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:13,990
Could you hit her?

238
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,828
( Laughs )

239
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,907
My uncle sent you?

240
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:31,076
Yes, Your Grace.

241
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,445
He chose us himself.

242
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,246
Hmm.

243
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:37,350
- <i>( Slapping )</i>
- <i>( Laughing )</i>

244
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,325
Use this.

245
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,539
Harder.

246
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:03,376
<i>( Whimpers )</i>

247
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,047
I said harder.

248
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,585
He'd want me to get
his money's worth.

249

( Whimpering, crying )

252
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,998
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

253
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,802
<i>( Woman whimpering )</i>
<i>Please, please,</i>

254

please, Your Grace.

255
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,744
Your Grace,
if your uncle finds out--

256
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,613
Oh, I want him
to find out.

257
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,916
You will bring her to his
chambers when you're finished

258
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,151
and show him
what you've done.

259
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:25,355
Or the same thing
will happen to you.

260
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,630
Begin.

261
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:41,940
- <i>( Thuds )</i>

00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,677
( Horse whinnies )

264
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,122
Well, if it isn't
my favorite whoremonger.

265
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:01,058
Pray I haven't kept
you waiting long.

266
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:05,295
Your Grace.

267
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,935
Now you do the Lannisters'
bidding, is that it?

268
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:15,171
Tell me, was my brother's
body even cold

269
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,373
before you secured
your newest patron?

270
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,776
I'm a practical man.

271
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,079
Just not a loyal one.

272
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,048
<i>And who would you have</i>
<i>me be loyal to?</i>

273
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,016
Your brother's corpse?

274
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,117
( Chuckles )

275
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:32,220
I don't like you,
Lord Baelish.

276
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,589
I don't like your face.

277
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:38,026
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

278
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,630
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

279
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:44,866
So tell me,
why are you here?

280
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,870
Renly:
<i>You can trust Brienne.</i>

281
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:50,405
Her loyalty comes
without charge.

282
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,610
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

283
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:59,048
many who believe
Ned Stark erred

284
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:01,217
by not supporting
your claim.

285
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:05,388
Now I understand.

286
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,324
You know I have
the numbers.

287
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:10,127
You know I'm marching
on King's Landing.

288
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:13,329
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

289
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,766
And your head.

290
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,768
I would give priority
to my head.

291
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:22,270
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>you don't like me,</i>

292
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:24,639
and while that
saddens me greatly,

293
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:27,308
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

294
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,844
<i>When you march</i>
<i>on King's Landing,</i>

295
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:34,281
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

296
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,518
open gates.

297
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,937
Your Grace.

298
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:59,907
Lord Baelish.

299
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:03,077
All of these tents
look the same to me.

300
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,446
- Would you be so kind--
- It would be my pleasure.

301
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,315
It took me weeks to learn
way around the camp.

302
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,385
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

303
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,088
And the moment I learn
which tent is mine,

304
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:15,824
we're on the move again.

305
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,491
Your tent?

306
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,661
Not our tent?

307
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:22,063
The King snores, perhaps?

308
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:25,200
Or simply prefers
solitude?

309
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:28,104
Pressures of command,
no doubt.

310
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:30,840
Four kings vying
for the throne.

311
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,242
I am not tutored
in warfare,

312
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:36,946
but basic arithmetic favors the
side with the greater numbers.

313
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,585
If war were arithmetic,

314
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,764
the mathematicians
would rule the world.

315
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:45,088
But I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent the just now.

316
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:47,323
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

317
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,392
And on the night
of the your wedding,

318
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:52,162
who was by
the King's side then?

319
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:54,398
You seem quite interested
in our marriage.

320
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:57,001
Your marriage
is quite interesting...

321
00:19:57,035 --> 00:20:00,138
Not only to me,
but to the realm.

322
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,275
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest,

323
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,444
if nothing else.

324
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:07,379
You've never married,
have you?

325
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:11,784
I've been unlucky
in my affections, sadly.

326
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:14,220
That is sad.

327
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,021
Though perhaps
it's for the best.

328
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,323
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

329
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,559
so allow me to explain.

330
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:25,030
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

331
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:28,600
Here is your tent,
Lord Baelish. Good night.

What do you know
of this place?

336
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:28,162
Only that the desert
around their walls

337
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:30,331
is called
the Garden of Nes.

338
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:34,935
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

339
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,204
the garden grows.

Dragon fire.

There's dragons here?

347
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:11,538
No, all the dragons
are dead.

348

What's that smell?

349
00:22:15,444 --> 00:22:18,179
Dead people.

You may have heard
false reports.

378
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:08,790
- You betrayed Ned.
- <i>Betrayed?</i>

379
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,758
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

380
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:12,327
I begged him
to seize the moment.

381
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:16,465
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.

And you repaid our faith
with treachery.

383

- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

I've loved you
since I was a boy.

386
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,913
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance--

387
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:33,349
Have you lost your mind?
Get out!

388
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,963
Do you want to see
your girls again?

389
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,802
Sansa, more beautiful
than ever.

390
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:58,874
And Arya,
just as wild as ever.

You have Arya, too?

392

I fear for
their longevity

What do you want?

399

The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

400
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:46,823
Of course they will.

401

Jaime Lannister

402
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,129
Robb will never agree
to those terms.

403
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:53,465
I'm not bringing
these terms to him.

I'm bringing them
to you.

405

You think I'd keep
secrets from my son?

406
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:00,939
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

407
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,907
but he's not a mother.

A token of Tyrion
Lannister's goodwill.

412

He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

413

Good faith?

415

What's this?

416
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:05,536
Your husband was
an honorable man.

417
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:09,274
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

He told me he stares

That's why he

of the Lord of Light.

473
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:36,509
Ah, you must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

474
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,745
<i>Mm, brother,</i>

475
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,048
now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

476
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,517
Watch yourself, Renly.

477
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,587
Renly:
<i>No, no, I'm relieved.</i>

478
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:48,789
I never really believed
you're a fanatic.

479
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,159
Charmless, rigid,
a bore, yes,

480
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:53,995
but not a godly man.

481
00:31:56,432 --> 00:31:58,733
You should kneel
he's the Lord's chosen,

482
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:01,103
<i>born amidst salt</i>
<i>and smoke.</i>

483
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:03,305
Born amidst salt
and smoke?

484
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,607
Is he a ham?

485
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,576
Stannis: <i>That's twice</i>
<i>I've warned you.</i>

486
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,511
Listen to yourselves.

487
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:11,781
If you were sons of mine, I
would knock your heads together

488
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:13,483
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered

489
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,118
that you were brothers.

490
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,820
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

491
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,656
<i>Your husband was a supporter</i>
<i>of my claim.</i>

492
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,725
Lord Eddard's integrity
cost him his head.

493
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,794
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

494
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:27,496
We share a common enemy.

495
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:31,233
The Iron Throne
is mine by right.

496
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:34,703
All those that deny that
are my foes.

497
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:37,973
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

498
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,742
Old men deny it
with their death rattle

499
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:42,645
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

500
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:46,882
No one wants you
for their King.

501
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:50,118
<i>You never wanted</i>
<i>any friends, brother.</i>

502
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:52,587
<i>But a man without friends</i>
<i>is a man without power.</i>

503
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:56,157
For the sake of the mother
who bore us,

504
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:58,560
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

505
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:01,196
Strike your banners,

506
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,831
come to me before dawn,

507
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:06,767
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

508
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:10,737
I'll even name you
my heir

509
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:12,606
until a son
is born to me.

510
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,944
Otherwise I shall
destroy you.

511
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,383
Look across
those fields, brother.

512
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,053
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>all those banners?</i>

513
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,823
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you King?

514
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:30,025
No.

515
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,196
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

516
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,098
We shall see, Renly.

517
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:37,868
Come the dawn,
we shall see.

518
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:40,070
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

519
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,606
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

520
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:51,714
Would you believe
I loved him once?

521
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:14,104
I thought we were welcome.

522
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:17,007
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

523
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,075
you might do the same,
Khaleesi.

524
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,479
Horde?

525
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:40,229
My name is Daenerys--

526
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:43,499
Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen.

527
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:45,568
You know me, My Lord?

528
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:48,238
Only by reputation,
Khaleesi.

529
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:51,808
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

530
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,546
They call you
the Mother of Dragons.

531
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,548
And what should
I call you?

532
00:34:57,582 --> 00:34:59,150
Oh, my name is quite long

533
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,753
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

534
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:05,391
I am simply a trader
of spices.

535
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:08,761
But we are the Thirteen,

536
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:12,132
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

537
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:15,869
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

538
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:19,704
The beauty of
Quarth is legendary--

539
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,729
Qarth.

540
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:24,811
Qarth.

541
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:27,881
Might we see
the dragons?

542
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:35,889
My friend,

543
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:38,358
we have travelled
very far.

544
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:40,893
<i>We have no food,</i>
<i>no water.</i>

545
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,395
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

546
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,265
Forgive me,
Mother of Dragons,

547
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:50,302
but no man alive has seen
a living dragon.

548
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:52,504
Some of my more
skeptical friends

549
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:55,974
refuse to believe
your children

550
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,909
even exist.

551
00:35:57,944 --> 00:36:01,346
<i>All we ask is the chance</i>
<i>to see for ourselves.</i>

552
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,348
I am not a liar.

553
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:05,417
Oh, I don't think you are.

554
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:07,152
But as I've never
met you before,

555
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:10,389
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

556
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:14,360
Where I come from,

557
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,862
guests are treated
with respect,

558
00:36:16,897 --> 00:36:20,199
not insulted
at the gates.

559
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,734
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

560
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,970
We wish you well.

561
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,376
What are you doing?

562
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,211
You promised
to receive me.

563
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:35,714
We have received you.

564
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:38,450
Here we are,
and here you are.

565
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:42,388
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

566
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:45,124
Which we shall
deeply regret.

567
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:46,229
But Qarth did not become

568
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:48,374
the greatest city that
ever was or will be

569
00:36:48,395 --> 00:36:52,065
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

570
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:01,174
Khaleesi, please
be careful.

571
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:06,613
Thirteen!

572
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,149
When my dragons are grown,

573
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:12,285
we will take back
what was stolen from me

574
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,654
and destroy those
who have wronged me.

575
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:17,157
We will lay waste
to armies

576
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,892
and burn cities
to the ground.

577
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:23,896
Turn us away and we will
burn you first.

578
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:26,098
Ah.

579
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,901
You are a true
Targaryen.

580
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:32,071
Only, as you said
a moment ago,

583
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:33,911
Retreating in fear
from a little girl

584
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:36,113
is unbecoming
of the greatest city

585
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:37,715
that ever was
or will be.

586
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:41,286
The discussion is over,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

587
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,321
The Thirteen have spoken.

588
00:37:43,356 --> 00:37:46,091
I am one of the Thirteen

589
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,560
and I am still speaking.

590
00:37:48,594 --> 00:37:50,929
The girl threatens to burn
our city to the ground

591
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:54,132
and you would invite her in
for a cup of wine?

592
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,234
She is the Mother
of Dragons.

593
00:37:56,268 --> 00:37:59,570
Do you expect her to watch
her people starve

594
00:37:59,604 --> 00:38:01,705
without breathing fire?

595
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,308
<i>I believe we can allow</i>
<i>a few Dothraki</i>

596
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:06,910
<i>through our gates</i>
<i>without dooming our city.</i>

597
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:10,248
<i>After all, here I am,</i>

598
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:12,350
a savage from
the Summer Isles,

599
00:38:12,384 --> 00:38:14,253
and Qarth still stands.

600
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,189
Our decision is final.

601
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:19,359
Very well.

602
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:24,231
I invoke <i>Soumai.</i>

603
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:30,736
<i>I will vouch for her,</i>
<i>her people,</i>

604
00:38:30,771 --> 00:38:34,139
<i>and her dragons</i>
<i>in accordance with the law.</i>

605
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:42,146
Be it on your head.

606
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:46,516
Welcome to Qarth,
My Lady.

607
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:38,435
Mountain:
<i>You.</i>

608
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:49,313
Tickler: Is there gold or silver
in the village?

609
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:52,249
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

610
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:54,885
I don't know
what that is.

611
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:03,394
( Squeaking )

612
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,567
( Horses neigh )

613
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:28,453
Man: <i>You two, take Lord Lannister's</i>
<i>things to his quarters.</i>

614
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,088
What's this?

615
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:32,791
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

616
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:35,461
( Chuckles )
Evidently not.

617
00:40:37,497 --> 00:40:39,298
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

618
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:41,701
Mountain: <i>Cells are overflowing,</i>
<i>My Lord.</i>

619
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:43,336
Polliver:
<i>This lot won't be here long.</i>

620
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,772
<i>Don't need</i>
<i>no permanent place.</i>

621
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:48,809
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

622
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:53,180
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

623
00:40:53,215 --> 00:40:56,017
able young bodies
and skilled laborers?

624
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:08,231
You,
do you have a trade?

625
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,067
Gendry:
<i>Smith, My Lord.</i>

626
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,938
What are you looking at?
Kneel!

627
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,776
Kneel or I'll carve
your lungs out, boy.

628
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,111
He'll do no such thing.

629
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:25,848
This one's a girl,
you idiot,

630
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:27,249
dressed as a boy.

631
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:30,352
- Why?
- Safer to travel, My Lord.

632
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:32,487
Smart.

633
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,389
More than I can say
for this lot.

634
00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:37,092
Get these prisoners
to work.

635
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:39,060
Bring the girl.

636
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:41,162
I need a new
cupbearer.

637
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:42,798
Mountain:
<i>My Lord.</i>

638
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:44,600
<i>( Knocking on door )</i>

639
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,208
Your visits
are too few, cousin.

640
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,843
Her Grace,
the Queen Regent,

641
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:56,246
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

642
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,616
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

643
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,019
Will you take
a cup with me?

644
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,522
I find that mulled wine
helps me sleep.

645
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,557
<i>I am here</i>
<i>at Her Grace's behest,</i>

646
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:08,759
not to drink
with you, Imp.

647
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,662
If my sister was
so concerned for Pycelle,

648
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,897
<i>I would have thought</i>
<i>she'd come herself.</i>

649
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,965
Instead she sends you.

650
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,433
What am I to make
of that?

651
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,502
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what you make of it,</i>

652
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:21,570
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

653
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:25,708
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

654
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:28,010
As I said several times.

655
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,947
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

656
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,181
When the Queen Regent
gives me a command, I carry

657
00:42:33,206 --> 00:42:35,206
it out without delay.

658
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:40,257
Cersei must have
great trust in you,

659
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,493
<i>allowing you</i>
<i>into her chamber</i>

660
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,396
during the hour
of the wolf.

661
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:52,203
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

662
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,838
She often works
from dusk till dawn.

663
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:56,206
She must be very glad
to have you helping her

664
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,575
from dusk till dawn.

665
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,610
Ah, lavender oil.

666
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,180
She always loved lavender oil,
even as a girl.

667
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,848
I am a knight!

668
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:08,651
An anointed knight, yes.

669
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:11,254
Tell me, did Cersei
have you knighted

670
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:14,858
before or after she took
you into her bed?

671
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,528
What?
Nothing to say?

672
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,463
No more warnings
for me, Ser?

673
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:21,432
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations.

674
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:23,034
Have you ever given
any thought

675
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,969
to what King Joffrey
will have to say

676
00:43:25,004 --> 00:43:28,406
when he finds out you've
been bedding his mother?

677
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:33,878
It's not my fault!

678
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,580
Did she take you
against your will?

679
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,615
Can you not defend
yourself, knight?

680
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,885
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

681
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,854
he told me to obey her
in everything.

682
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:45,755
Did he tell you
to fuck her, too?

683
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,025
I only meant
I did as I was bid.

684
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,827
Hated every
moment of it,

685
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,862
is that what you'll
have me believe?

686
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,932
A high place in court,
a knighthood,

687
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,201
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

688
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,570
Oh, yes, it must
have been terrible.

689
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,606
Wait here. His Grace will want
to hear this.

690
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,909
Mercy!
Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

691
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:05,544
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

692
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:07,299
My Lord, it was
your sister's bidding--

693
00:44:07,324 --> 00:44:08,414
the Queen.

694
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,282
I'll leave the city
at once, I swear.

695
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,519
- No, I think not.
- My Lord?

696
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:15,520
You heard me.

697
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,599
My father told you
to obey my sister.

698
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,060
Obey her.

699
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:25,430
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.

700
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:27,532
Pleasure her
whenever she requires.

701
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:29,634
No one ever need know

702
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:33,104
as long as you keep
faith with me.

703
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,606
I want to know
what Cersei is doing,

704
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:39,509
where she goes,
who she sees,

705
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,944
what they talk of--
everything.

706
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,979
And you will tell me.

707
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,382
Yes, My Lord, I will.

708
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,717
I swear it,
as you command.

709
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:54,289
Oh, rise, rise.

710
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:57,493
Let us drink to
our understanding.

711
00:44:57,527 --> 00:45:00,062
Oh, you don't have
a cup. Oh, well.

712
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:03,166
Smile, cousin. My sister
is a beautiful woman.

713
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,834
And it's all for
the good of the realm.

714
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,470
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

715
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,572
that I want no more
conflict between us

716
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,350
and that henceforth

717
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,343
I shall do nothing
without her consent.

718
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:14,644
But her demands.

719
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,313
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

720
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,582
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

721
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:21,551
<i>Cersei can keep him</i>
<i>as a pet if she wants,</i>

722
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,586
<i>but I will not have him</i>
<i>on the council.</i>

723
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:26,456
I could swear that I had not
harmed a single hair on his head,

724
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,993
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

725
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:38,935
<i>( Wood creaking )</i>

726
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,570
<i>( Waves crashing )</i>

727
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:44,273
Man: <i>Stay within</i>
<i>one table length.</i>

728
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,247
Your Grace.

729
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,120
Do your knucklebones
bring you luck?

730
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,025
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

731
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,461
And it's four less
fingernails to clean.

732
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:09,030
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

733
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:12,000
Four fewer
fingernails to clean.

734
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:15,370
Never understood
why you had to wear them.

735
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:18,373
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

736
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,444
It reminds me
of your justice.

737
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,979
It was an honest
punishment

738
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,548
and you were good
with the cleaver.

739
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:27,250
You were a hero
and a smuggler.

740
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,720
A good act does not
wash out the bad,

741
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,622
nor a bad the good.

742
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,125
A lesson I've tried
to teach my son.

743
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:38,260
- Does he listen?
- To me?

744
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,963
Gods, no.

745
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:43,765
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest--

746
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,101
She has a name.

747
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:51,506
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

748
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,845
I've lived within
the law for 17--

749
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,280
I want you to be
a smuggler this time.

750
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,883
Any shore, any night.

751
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,652
What am I bringing
ashore?

752
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,521
The red woman.

753
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:08,392
No one must know
what you do

754
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,027
and we'll not speak
of this again.

755
00:47:10,062 --> 00:47:13,597
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be,

756
00:47:13,632 --> 00:47:16,600
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

757
00:47:16,635 --> 00:47:19,069
Cleaner ways
don't win wars.

758
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:51,771
Are you afraid,
onion knight?

759
00:47:54,008 --> 00:47:55,257
Someone once told me

760
00:47:55,282 --> 00:47:57,680
the night is dark and
full of terrors.

761
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:02,081
You've carried more
unpleasant cargo in your time.

762
00:48:05,985 --> 00:48:08,921
Are you a good man,
Ser Davos Seaworth?

763
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:10,915
I'd say my parts
are mixed, My Lady--

764
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,825
good and bad.

765
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:15,328
If half an onion
is black with rot,

766
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:17,263
it's a rotten onion.

767
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:20,000
A man is good
or he is evil.

768
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:21,901
- And which are you?
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

769
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:25,238
I'm a knight myself
of sorts,

770
00:48:25,273 --> 00:48:28,108
a champion of light
and life.

771
00:48:28,142 --> 00:48:31,311
Well, that must be
very nice for you.

772
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:51,701
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

773
00:48:51,736 --> 00:48:54,037
Yet you have known
other women.

774
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:55,905
Don't talk about my wife.

775
00:48:55,939 --> 00:48:59,909
I'm not. I'm talking about
other women.

776
00:48:59,943 --> 00:49:02,311
Like me, Ser Davos.

777
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,484
You want me.

778
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:11,487
You want to see
what's beneath this robe.

779
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,291
And you will.

780
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,867
Strange that
this Lord of Light

781
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:25,770
asks you to work
in the shadows.

782
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:29,073
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

783
00:49:29,108 --> 00:49:31,609
They are servants
of light,

784
00:49:31,643 --> 00:49:34,078
the children of fire.

785
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:37,548
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

786
00:49:37,582 --> 00:49:40,417
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

787
00:49:40,452 --> 00:49:41,885
( Chuckles )

788
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,187
