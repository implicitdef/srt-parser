00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:02,791
<i>Maester Luwin,</i>
<i>send a raven to Pyke</i>

2
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:05,194
informing my father
of my victory here.

3
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:06,896
And one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,366
Inform her that she's to
bring 500 men to Winterfell.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,834
When do we sail
for King's Landing?

6
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:14,003
Soon as I've consolidated
my troops.

7
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:16,572
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

8
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:19,508
The fist of the First Men.
Thousands of years ago

9
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,909
the First Men stood here.

10
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:22,844
They came here to get
away from something.

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,646
And I don't think
it worked.

12
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:26,649
<i>Do you really think I'll let</i>
<i>you ship Myrcella off to Dorne?</i>

13
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:28,951
Dorne is the safest
place for her.

14
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,655
I want you to know what
it's like to love someone,

15
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,826
to truly love someone
before I take her from you.

16
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,928
You let a halfwit escape
with a cripple?

17
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,197
<i>And Rickon, too?</i>
<i>The little one?</i>

18
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,599
<i>Gone, along with</i>
<i>the wildling woman.</i>

19
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,134
Wait, I know that farm.

20
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,570
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

21
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,372
I've been treating
your wounded men.

22
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,440
<i>I've already run through the</i>
<i>supplies I brought with me.</i>

23
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:51,476
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender.

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,746
Come with me to the Crag. Let
the Maester show you his stores.

25
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,054
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

26
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:06,058
<i>They want your head.</i>

27
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:08,393
Old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

28
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:11,431
You strangled his son
with your chains.

29
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:14,367
- He was in my way.
- You are a man without honor.

30
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:16,036
Brienne, your sword.

31
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:19,873
You have my dragons?

32
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:22,059
I will take you to
the House of the Undying

33
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:23,444
where I have put them.

34
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:27,749
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

35
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:30,819
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally

36
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:32,921
<i>and what would happen</i>

- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,728
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

I took the great castle

You're a great warrior.

00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,667
I saw the bodies
above your gates.

52

Which one gave you
the tougher fight,

53
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,236
the cripple or
the six-year-old?

54
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:38,874
I treated the Stark
boys with honor

55
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:40,842
and they repaid me
with treachery.

56
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:44,012
You treated them with honor
by butchering them?

57
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,848
Before I had to kill them,
I treated them--

58
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:48,150
you seized their home,
as is your right.

59
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:50,920
- We're Ironborn; We take what we need.
- Exactly.

60
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:53,956
Then you made them prisoners in
their home and they ran away.

61
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:56,359
Is that treachery?

62
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:58,495
I'd call it bravery.

63
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,030
They made me a promise--

64
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:01,999
Your little boy prisoners
made you a promise

65
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,468
and you got mad
when they broke it?

66
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:06,202
Are you the dumbest
cunt alive?

67
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,238
- Don't call me a--
- A cunt.

68
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:12,441
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

69
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,743
You know how valuable
those boys were?

70
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:17,412
If I hadn't killed them, the
Northerners would think me weak.

71
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:20,582
You are weak.
And you're stupid.

72
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,018
I'm warning you.

73
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,786
Go on, then,

74
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,621
warn me.

75
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,194
You haven't brought
enough men.

76
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,629
How am I supposed to defend
Winterfell with just this lot?

77
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:37,732
You're not. I've come to bring
you home.

78
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,267
- Father wants a word.
- Is this a joke?

79
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:41,969
Winterfell is the heart
of the North.

80
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:45,906
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles
from the sea.

81
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,541
We're islanders,
baby brother.

82
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,109
<i>Had you forgotten that?</i>

83
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,845
<i>Our power comes</i>
<i>from our ships.</i>

84
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,947
<i>And now that you've</i>
<i>decorated your walls</i>

85
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,682
<i>with the bodies</i>
<i>of the Stark boys,</i>

86
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:59,585
every man in the North
wants to see you hanged.

87
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,954
When Robb Stark
finds out--

88
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,889
He won't find out.
We've killed all the ravens.

89
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,926
We have all the horses.

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,896
I've taken Winterfell.

91
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,700
And I will keep Winterfell.

92
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:17,238
Leave us.

93
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,887
Theon, you're my blood.

94
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,725
We both loved our mother.

95
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,895
We both endured
our father.

96
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:43,898
Come home with me.
Don't die here alone.

97
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,133
I don't intend to die.

98
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,708
You were a terrible baby,
do you know that?

99
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:58,079
Bawling all the time,
never sleeping.

100
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:02,183
And one night you just
wouldn't shut up,

101
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:05,888
screaming like a dying pig.

102
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:09,592
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

103
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:12,896
I wanted to strangle you.

104
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,033
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

105
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,804
You smiled at me.

106
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,444
Don't die
so far from the sea.

107
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:45,262
I've brought you
a present, Lord of Bones.

108
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:48,464
I already got one crow.
Don't need two.

109
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,666
Mance will want
to question this one.

110
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,569
<i>Knows all about where the crows</i>
<i>are and what they're planning.</i>

111
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:57,139
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

112
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,440
Gut him.

113
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:01,243
He could have killed me
half a dozen times.

114
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:04,045
And now he wishes he did.
Gut him.

115
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,350
He's a bastard of Winterfell,
Ned Stark's son.

116
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:13,889
Mance will want him.

117
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:16,958
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

118
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,727
I don't know.

119
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:21,630
I think he'll want
to decide for himself.

120
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:31,307
He runs, I'll chop
his balls off.

121
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:34,177
He runs,
I'll do it meself.

122
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,620
We're even now,
Jon Snow.

123
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,368
I couldn't do it.

124
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:01,236
I had the sword at her neck,
I just couldn't--

125
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,406
- I know.
- The others?

126
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,376
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

127
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,812
We found your tracks
fast enough.

128
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:12,982
But they found us
before we found you.

129
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,552
They died because of me.

130
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,755
See that it wasn't
for nothing.

131
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,257
All right, up, lad.

132
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,126
Come on,
on your feet, now.

133
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,927
Move it.

134
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,502
Is she beautiful?

135
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:34,703
I've never met her.

136
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,438
What's her name?

137
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,207
Frey, I suppose.

138
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:39,908
I don't know
her first name.

139
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:43,346
I'm sure you'll
be very happy.

140
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,918
And you're marrying
her for a bridge?

141
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:52,189
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

142
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,392
It was before
they killed my father.

143
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:58,463
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

144
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,732
but only if I crossed
that bridge.

145
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,337
When I speak to people
from the North,

146
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,806
they all loved
your father.

147
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,343
He was the best man
I ever met.

148
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,279
I know children always think
that about their fathers, but--

149
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,049
Children do not always think that
about their fathers,

150
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,751
believe me.

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,656
He once told me that being
a Lord is like being a father,

152
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,025
except you have
thousands of children

153
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,361
and you worry about
all of them.

154
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:31,330
The farmers plowing
the fields are yours to protect.

155
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,667
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

156
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:38,438
The soldiers
you order into battle.

157
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,674
He told me he woke
with fear in the morning

158
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,976
and went to bed
with fear in the night.

159
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,781
I didn't believe him.

160
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,983
I asked him,

161
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:53,252
"how can a man be brave
if he's afraid?"

162
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,823
"That is the only time
a man can be brave," he told me.

163
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,095
I wish I could have
met him.

164
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,497
He would have
liked you.

165
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,935
Most Lords worry more
about their gold

166
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,304
and their glory than the charwomen
scrubbing their floors.

167
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,529
He didn't care much
about gold or glory.

168
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:16,074
And you?

169
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,311
You think I'm fighting this war so
they'll sing songs about me?

170
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,614
I want to go home.

171
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,316
I want the men
following me to go home.

172
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,884
Then why don't you?

173
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,554
Because we'll never be safe until
the Lannisters are defeated.

174
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,789
And because I believe
in justice.

175
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,092
Chopping off
Joffrey's head, you mean.

176
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,459
That would be a start.

177
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,538
Your Grace, Milady.

178
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,609
The Kingslayer,
he escaped in the night.

179
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:53,111
How?

180
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,516
How?!

181
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,189
Tell me this isn't true.

182
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,362
Why?

183
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:13,166
- For the girls.
- You betrayed me.

184
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,135
- Robb--
- No!

185
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,836
You knew I would
not allow it

186
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,205
and you did it
anyway.

187
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,909
Bran and Rickon
are captives in Winterfell.

188
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,246
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

189
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,049
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

190
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,786
I lost one son fighting
by your son's side.

191
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,788
I lost another
to the Kingslayer,

192
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,890
strangled with a chain.

193
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,159
You commit treason

194
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,529
<i>because your children</i>
<i>are prisoners?</i>

195
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:44,365
<i>I would carve out</i>
<i>my heart</i>

196
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,034
and offer it to the father
if he would let my sons

197
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,437
wake from their graves
and step into a prison cell.

198
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:52,172
I grieve for
your sons, My Lord.

199
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,842
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

200
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,611
And you stole it
from me.

201
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,381
Killing Jaime Lannister

202
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:02,583
would not buy life
for your children,

203
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,451
but returning him
to King's Landing

204
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:07,354
may buy life
for mine.

205
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:10,892
Jaime Lannister has played
you for a fool.

206
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:13,161
You've weakened
our position.

207
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:15,830
You've brought discord
into our camp.

208
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:18,500
And you did it all
behind my back.

209
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:23,805
Make sure she's guarded
day and night.

210
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,565
Robb.

211
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,590
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

212
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,010
40, Your Grace.

213
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:31,280
Send another 40
with our fastest horses.

214
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,949
Robb.

215
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:47,397
Whoa, oof!

216
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,335
Damn.

217
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:57,506
You're much uglier
in daylight.

218
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,975
What's your name?

219
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,978
I'm Jaime Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

220
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:05,914
son of Tywin.

221
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:09,784
A captive Knight has a right
to know his captor's identity.

222
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:11,419
Brienne of Tarth.

223
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:13,087
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

224
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:16,323
Crescent moons
and starbursts.

225
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:20,126
Lord... Selwyn Tarth,

226
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,562
your father.

227
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,765
Do you have any brothers
and sisters, My Lady?

228
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,468
It's a long way
to King's Landing.

229
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,637
Might as well get
to know one another.

230
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:33,374
Have you known many men?

231
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:34,842
I suppose not.

232
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,477
Women?

233
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:39,046
Horses?
Ah!

234
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:41,015
I didn't mean to give
offense, My Lady.

235
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,105
Forgive me.

236
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,156
Your crimes are past
forgiveness, Kingslayer.

237
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,187
Why do you
hate me so much?

238
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,789
- <i>Have I ever harmed you?</i>
- <i>You've harmed others--</i>

239
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,358
<i>those you were</i>
<i>sworn to protect,</i>

240
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,427
the weak,
the innocent.

241
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:56,630
Has anyone ever told you you're
as boring as you are ugly?

242
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,166
You will not
provoke me to anger.

243
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,702
I already have.
Look at you.

244
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,503
You're ready
to chop my head off.

245
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:06,306
Do you think
you could?

246
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,341
Do you think you could
beat me in a fair fight?

247
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:10,076
I've never
seen you fight.

248
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,112
The answer is no.

249
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:14,458
There are three men
in the kingdoms who might

250
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:15,648
have a chance against me.

251
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,150
You're not one of them.

252
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:20,287
All my life men like you
have sneered at me.

253
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:23,557
And all my life I've been knocking
men like you into the dust.

254
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,026
If you're so confident,
unlock my chains.

255
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,795
Let's see what happens.

256
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,898
Do you take me
for an idiot? In.

257
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:36,037
I took you
for a fighter,

258
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:39,974
a man-- pardon--
woman of honor.

259
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,477
Was I wrong?

260
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:44,245
You're afraid.

261
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:49,284
Maybe one day
we'll find out, Kingslayer.

262
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,464
<i>King's Landing</i>
<i>will fall an hour</i>

263
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,601
<i>after Stannis</i>
<i>lands his force.</i>

264
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,936
<i>It's not too late for</i>
<i>King Joffrey and Cersei</i>

265
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:13,306
<i>and the court</i>
<i>to ride west to safety.</i>

266
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,442
Surrender the Iron Throne?

267
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:18,479
Better than seeing their heads
mounted on the city gates.

268
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:21,114
Stannis will
execute them all.

269
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,284
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

270
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,087
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.

271
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:31,190
Stannis, two days
from the capital

272
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,958
and the wolf
at my doorstep.

273
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,028
The scouts assure us Robb Stark
remains north of Ashemark.

274
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,930
Ha! The last time
the scouts assured us

275
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,666
of Stark's movement,
he lured us into a trap.

276
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,937
<i>Which is why my son</i>
<i>is his prisoner.</i>

277
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,711
<i>Too close</i>
<i>to Casterly Rock.</i>

278
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,282
He sent a splinter force

279
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:56,917
to recapture Winterfell.

280
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:59,153
The Greyjoys have
done us a great favor.

281
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,390
Stark won't risk marching
on Casterly Rock

282
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:03,991
until he's at full force.

283
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,728
He's a boy and he's
never lost a battle.

284
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:10,063
He'll risk anything
at any time

285
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,733
<i>because he doesn't know</i>
<i>enough to be afraid.</i>

286
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,141
We'll ride at nightfall.

287
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,411
<i>I want a full night's march before</i>
<i>he knows we're on the move.</i>

288
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,981
Clegane, you'll maintain
a Garrison here at Harrenhal.

289
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,518
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

290
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:38,589
The girl has proven
herself a good servant.

291
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,025
<i>She'll stay on with you.</i>

292
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,294
<i>See that he doesn't get</i>
<i>drunk in the evenings.</i>

293
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,097
He's poor company
when he's sober,

294
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,800
but he's better
at his work.

295
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:58,175
You've got some
questions to answer.

296
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:00,243
<i>Who killed Ser Amory?</i>

297
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,945
- I don't know!
<i>- Give me the name.</i>

298
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,280
- Please!
<i>- Take this one out for the crows.</i>

299
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:07,651
<i>I told you, I don't know.</i>

300
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,787
<i>Please.</i>

301
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:12,556
Look, it's Yoren's
little cunt.

302
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,325
Used to be a boy,
now it's a girl.

303
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,262
Where's Jaqen?

304
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,931
Don't care.

305
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,067
Where's your stick
now, bitch?

306
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,568
I promised
to fuck you with it.

307
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,671
<i>Come on, time to kill</i>
<i>some wolves.</i>

308
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,815
You need sour cherries
to make it right.

309
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,966
<i>And the secret is you dry</i>
<i>the stones, and then you</i>

310
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,051
<i>break them with a mallet.</i>

311
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:42,853
<i>That's where</i>
<i>the real flavor is.</i>

312
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,521
<i>You crush 'em up real fine.</i>

313
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,758
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

314
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,627
- Where's Jaqen?
- How would I know?

315
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,462
I need him now.

316
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,197
Lord Tywin's
marching tonight.

317
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,933
- You need him?
- He's helping me.

318
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,436
- I saw him.
- Where?

319
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,440
- Where?!
- Ow!

320
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,238
Where?

321
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,910
They went riding out
the gates a few hours ago.

322
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:08,047
On patrol.
Let go of my ears.

323
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:14,821
What do you want
with him anyway?

324
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,506
Mance is gonna
march on the Wall.

325
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,908
When he does, one brother
inside his army

326
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:36,744
will be worth 1,000
fighting against it.

327
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,947
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

328
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:40,916
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

329
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,486
How does it feel knowing
those men all died

330
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,573
so you could skip through the
snow with your little savage girl?

331
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:47,175
I didn't.

332
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,280
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard.

333
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:57,800
He's not yours
to kill, crow.

334
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:21,959
Do you have
to do that here?

335
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:26,630
I like to keep
me hands clean.

336
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,266
Yes, but do you
have to do it here?

337
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,076
You should start wearing
the gold cloak.

338
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,745
I don't want to wear
a gold cloak.

339
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,247
<i>You're commander</i>
<i>of the City Watch.</i>

340
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:45,682
You shouldn't be dressed
like a common sellsword.

341
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:47,417
A cloak slows you down
in a fight,

342
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,486
makes it hard
to move quietly.

343
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,154
And the gold
catches the light,

344
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:53,323
so you're nice and easy
to spot at night.

345
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:56,193
Well, you're not sneaking
through alleyways any longer.

346
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:58,094
You're supposed
to stand out.

347
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:01,231
We had a deal, and wearing
a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

348
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:03,167
Fine, fine.

349
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:06,938
No gold cloak.

350
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,348
- What?
- What?

351
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:18,684
What? What?
Why are you staring at me?

352
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:21,721
You don't want me
cleaning me nails.

353
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:23,156
You don't want me
looking your way.

354
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,058
Why am I here?

355
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,757
To help me plan the defense
of King's Landing.

356
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:30,497
Stannis will be here
any day.

357
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,436
And one of these
explains how to beat him?

358
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:40,641
"An History of the Great
Sieges of Westeros"

359
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,644
by Archmaester
"Shevelathin."

360
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,646
"Shevelatesh."

361
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,815
"Chevalteesh."

362
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:53,388
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

363
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:55,757
My Lord Hand,
Commander.

364
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,258
I must compliment you

365
00:21:57,293 --> 00:22:00,528
on the Gold Cloaks' performance
these last few weeks.

366
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:04,566
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

367
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:08,403
I did not know.

368
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:11,707
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

369
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:14,176
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

370
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:16,812
For questioning?

371
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:19,448
<i>Uh, no.</i>

372
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:21,783
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

373
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,853
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

374
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,889
Have you ever been
in a city under siege?

375
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:30,358
Maybe this part's
not in your books.

376
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:32,794
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people.

377
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:36,031
It's the starving.
Food's worth more than gold.

378
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,668
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

379
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,569
Things get bad enough,

380
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:43,438
the poor start
eating each other.

381
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:46,374
<i>The thieves,</i>
<i>they love a siege.</i>

382
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:49,511
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

383
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:52,548
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

384
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:55,952
Given the circumstances,
My Lord,

385
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:59,489
I believe extreme measures
are warranted.

386
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:01,391
Ah.

387
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,427
"The Great Sieges
of Westeros."

388
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:06,495
Thrilling subject.

389
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:11,299
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

390
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:18,272
Stannis knows
King's Landing.

391
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:20,908
He knows where the walls
are strongest

392
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:24,678
and he knows which gates
are weakest.

393
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:29,149
The mud gate.

394
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:32,153
A good ram will batter it
down in minutes

395
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,888
<i>and it's only 50 yards</i>
<i>from the water.</i>

396
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:36,457
That's where he'll land.

397
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:39,360
And if Stannis does
attack the mud gate,

398
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:41,662
what is our plan?

399
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,697
We could throw
books at his men.

400
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:45,266
We don't have
that many books.

401
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,134
We don't have
that many men, either.

402
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:50,337
What do we have?

403
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:53,473
Pig shit.

404
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,625
I'm not cut out
for this sort of work.

405
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,128
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

406
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:19,964
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

407
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:22,634
I can't imagine
anything much worse.

408
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:26,237
<i>You lack imagination.</i>

409
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:29,708
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>Jon is right now?</i>

410
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:32,678
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

411
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,947
A betting man
would go with dead.

412
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,784
He's not dead.

413
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:39,986
No, Jon's a great
fighter.

414
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,955
Well, he's better
than me

415
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,958
and a lot better
than you.

416
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:46,894
He's got a Valyrian
steel sword.

417
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,829
So did his father.

418
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,632
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

419
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,367
Great rangers never
get old is the problem.

420
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:56,970
Shit ones neither.

421
00:24:57,005 --> 00:25:00,107
It's them in the middle
that last a long time.

422
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,980
What in seven hells
is that?

423
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:25,763
The First Men
made these marks.

424
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:28,432
Help me with it.

425
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:42,346
Look.

426
00:25:46,384 --> 00:25:48,919
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

427
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:52,023
best thing to do is pretend
you've never seen it.

428
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:53,758
That's a Night's
Watch cloak.

429
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:56,295
It's been here
a long time.

430
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:04,236
Oh, must be Dragonglass.

431
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,304
<i>Dragonglass?</i>

432
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,174
The Maesters
call it Obsidian.

433
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,109
Why would a brother
hide it here?

434
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:15,679
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

435
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:22,786
Mind where you're going.

436
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:34,333
I'm sorry.
I'll--

437
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,137
- where were you?
- A man has patrol duty.

438
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:39,773
Tywin Lannister
was right here

439
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,108
and now he's gone.

440
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,943
A girl owes
one more name.

441
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,344
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

442
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,347
How long after
I give you the name

443
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:50,382
does it take you
to kill someone?

444
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,051
A minute, an hour,
a month.

445
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,390
Death is certain,
the time is not.

446
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:01,558
He's taking his army
to attack my brother.

447
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:04,494
I need him dead
right now.

448
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,797
This a man
cannot do.

449
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:09,300
You promised
you'd help me.

450
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:11,335
Help was not promised,
lovely girl.

451
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,172
Only death.
There must be others.

452
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:16,541
Give a name,
any name.

453
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,677
And you'll kill them?

454
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:20,646
Anybody?

455
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,685
By the seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

456
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,587
I swear it.

457
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:33,258
All right.

458
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:40,163
Jaqen H'ghar.

459
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:48,605
A girl gives a man
his own name?

460
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:51,274
- That's right.
- <i>Gods are not mocked.</i>

461
00:27:51,308 --> 00:27:53,844
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

462
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:55,445
A man can go kill himself.

463
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,480
- Un-name me.
- No.

464
00:27:57,515 --> 00:27:59,649
Please?

465
00:28:01,352 --> 00:28:03,486
I'll un-name you.

466
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:04,519
Thank you.

467
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:06,273
If you help me
and my friends escape.

468
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,893
<i>This would require</i>
<i>more than one life.</i>

469
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:13,130
- <i>This is not part of our bargain.</i>
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

470
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:15,266
A girl lacks honor.

471
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:26,110
If I do this thing,
a girl must obey.

472
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:28,213
A girl will obey.

473
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:33,117
A girl and her friends will walk
through the gate at midnight.

474
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:40,356
Thank you, Podrick.

475
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:48,632
Odd little boy.

476
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,867
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

477
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:53,470
You and Varys both.

478
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:57,341
Excellent lamprey pie.

479
00:28:57,376 --> 00:29:00,077
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

480
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:02,847
I hear Joffrey
plans on fighting.

481
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:05,350
An inspiration
for the troops.

482
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:07,019
The young king
in his shining armor

483
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,854
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

484
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:11,690
He's only a boy.

485
00:29:11,724 --> 00:29:14,259
Younger boys are off
fighting his war.

486
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,095
He's not ready.

487
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,364
What is he, 17?

488
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,200
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

489
00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:24,037
Some men have a gift
for this sort of thing,

490
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:25,939
some don't.

491
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,840
His place is not
on the battlefield.

492
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,109
It's not on
the throne, either,

493
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,577
sadly for all of us.

494
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,816
Do you think
I'm an idiot?

495
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,651
No, I'd say you possess
above average intelligence.

496
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,820
You shipped off
my only daughter.

497
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:45,156
And now you want to send my
eldest son to the battlefield to die.

498
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,359
He'll have his Kingsguard
protecting him.

499
00:29:47,393 --> 00:29:50,328
He has the finest armor
gold can buy.

500
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,230
He needs to be out there.

501
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:54,345
The men will fight more
fiercely seeing their king

502
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,300
fighting beside them

503
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:58,971
instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

504
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,440
Any dessert?

505
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:04,377
Do you know why
Varys is so dangerous?

506
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:07,447
Because he has thousands
of spies in his employ.

507
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:10,784
Because he knows everything
we do before we do it.

508
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:12,386
Because he doesn't
have a cock.

509
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,855
Neither do you.

510
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:18,659
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

511
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,494
You, on the other hand,

512
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,997
are as big a fool
as every other man.

513
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:25,366
That little worm
between your legs

514
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:26,901
does half your thinking.

515
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:29,803
It's not that little.

516
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,843
Why are you smiling?

517
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,412
Because I'm happy.

518
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,180
And why are you happy?

519
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:47,888
Because I have
your little whore.

520
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,094
I thought you
preferred blondes.

521
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:54,495
Such a droll little fellow.

522
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,364
Tell me, have you
married this one yet?

523
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,633
No?

524
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:01,604
Oh, good.
Father will be so pleased.

525
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:03,273
Why do you care
who I fuck?

526
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:05,975
Because a Lannister
always pays her debts.

527
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,610
You stole my only daughter,

528
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:09,245
you plot to have
Joffrey killed.

529
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,182
This is madness.
Stannis will be here in days.

530
00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:13,783
- You need me.
- For what?

531
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,919
Your skill in battle?

532
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,889
Pretty thing, your whore.

533
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:22,425
Lovely body.

534
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,028
The bruises
will heal in time.

535
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,131
Where did you find her?

536
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,401
Varys isn't the only one
who hears whispers.

537
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:33,904
Really, a Lannister
lion necklace?

538
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:37,041
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

539
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:39,911
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

540
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:41,780
Oh?

541
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:43,415
Well, you're the expert.

542
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,617
Tell me.

543
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:49,120
You don't buy them;
You only rent them.

544
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:53,691
You're usually a better liar,
baby brother.

545
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:55,659
This one you like.

546
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:59,196
You like her very much.

547
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,298
Could it be love?

548
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:04,935
Don't worry, she'll be treated
gently enough...

549
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,670
unless Joffrey is hurt.

550
00:32:06,704 --> 00:32:10,274
And then every wound
he suffers she'll suffer, too.

551
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,677
And if he dies,

552
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,678
there isn't a man alive
who could devise

553
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,882
a more painful death
for your little cunt.

554
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:24,156
And how do I know you
haven't killed her already?

555
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,691
Would you like to see her?

556
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,326
I thought you might.

557
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,096
Ser Mandon, bring in
my brother's whore.

558
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:04,630
I'm sorry they hurt you.

559
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:08,534
You must be brave.

560
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,807
I promise
I will free you.

561
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:18,942
Don't forget me.

562
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:21,278
Never.

563
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:41,767
I will hurt you
for this.

564
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:45,405
A day will come when you
think you're safe and happy

565
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:49,542
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

566
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,245
And you will know
the debt is paid.

567
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,415
Get out.

568
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:08,894
Shae!

569
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,598
I've been waiting
all night.

570
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:15,333
What is wrong?

571
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:17,502
You're beautiful.

572
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,846
Then why do you look sad?

573
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:36,188
We have to be
more careful.

574
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:39,258
Don't be afraid.
I can take care of myself.

575
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:42,361
There are people
who want to hurt me.

576
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:44,864
I know.
I won't let them.

577
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:48,067
I'll cut off their faces.
I will.

578
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,008
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?

579
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:59,778
I expect I'll have to
before this is over.

580
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:04,083
You're mine.

581
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:07,253
I'm yours.

582
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:09,622
Promise me.

583
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:16,796
I'm yours,
and you are mine.

584
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:29,842
<i>Still no word?</i>

585
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:32,444
We've sent
a dozen ravens.

586
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:34,913
None have returned.

587
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:38,316
My bastard is only
a few days from Winterfell.

588
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,351
- Once he captures the castle--
- Theon has my brothers.

589
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:44,755
- If we storm the castle--
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

590
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:48,692
They're his only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

591
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:52,764
Send word to your son.

592
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:55,834
Any Ironborn who surrender

593
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:59,104
will be allowed to return
safely to their homes.

594
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:02,408
A touch of mercy is a virtue,
Your Grace. Too much--

595
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:06,111
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

596
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:09,347
He betrayed our cause.

597
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:11,650
He betrayed me.

598
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:14,620
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

599
00:36:14,654 --> 00:36:17,071
I expect his countrymen
will turn on him the minute

600
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:18,301
they hear the offer.

601
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:23,995
Your pardon, My Lord.
Your Grace.

602
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,964
My Lady.

603
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:39,341
How are you?

604
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:42,011
How am I?

605
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:44,279
I've had to arrest
my mother.

606
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:46,716
The Lannisters
have my sisters.

607
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,651
The man I considered
my closest friend

608
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:51,521
has seized my home
and my brothers.

609
00:36:51,555 --> 00:36:54,657
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

610
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:57,159
I'm sorry.
It was a stupid question.

611
00:36:57,194 --> 00:36:59,462
- I'm sorry.
- No.

612
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:01,731
Forgive me.

613
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:04,066
You're being kind.
I have no right.

614
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:06,135
You have every right.

615
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:07,537
You're a king.

616
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:10,039
That's not the kind
of king I want to be.

617
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:12,342
What kind do you
want to be?

618
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:15,078
I don't know.
The good kind.

619
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:20,584
Most kings grew up
as princes.

620
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:23,787
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

621
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:26,823
I was raised to be
Lord of Winterfell.

622
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:31,027
I was raised to be
a proper little lady,

623
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:34,130
to play the harp
and dance the latest steps

624
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,199
and recite
Valyrian poetry.

625
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:37,834
I'd like to hear you
play the harp.

626
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:40,003
No.
No, you would not.

627
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:48,878
How did you go from
reciting Valyrian poetry

628
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:51,113
to sawing off
men's feet?

629
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,224
When I was 12,

630
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:05,860
my mother and father
went to a wedding.

631
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:09,163
Weddings in Volantis
last for days, you know.

632
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,433
And they left me
with my little brother.

633
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:15,037
The second afternoon
they were gone

634
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:18,107
was the hottest day
in the three-year summer.

635
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:21,678
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

636
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:25,315
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

637
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:29,385
<i>The rich, the poor,</i>
<i>we were all there,</i>

638
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:32,588
naked, screaming, racing
to the little islands.

639
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:35,458
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

640
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,098
I was treading water,

641
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:44,433
talking to a friend

642
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:46,935
when I realized
I hadn't seen my brother.

643
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:51,273
I called his name.

644
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:53,976
Then I started
screaming his name.

645
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:58,646
And then I saw him

646
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,781
floating facedown.

647
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:05,219
My heart just...
stopped.

648
00:39:05,253 --> 00:39:07,354
I was...

649
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,293
I dragged him
from the water.

650
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:15,863
My friend helped me,
I think.

651
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:17,965
I don't even remember.

652
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,503
He was so little.

653
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:26,206
Then we pulled him
onto the riverbank...

654
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:30,377
and I screamed at him

655
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,880
and I shook him

656
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:35,216
and he was dead.

657
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:38,118
Just dead.

658
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:44,191
A man ran over.

659
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:49,163
He had a fish
tattoo on his face.

660
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:52,834
In Volantis the slaves
have tattoos

661
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:56,204
so you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

662
00:39:56,238 --> 00:39:58,940
And this man worked
on a fishing boat.

663
00:39:58,974 --> 00:40:02,310
And he pushed me
out of the way.

664
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,312
You have to understand,

665
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:07,515
for a slave to push
a highborn girl--

666
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:11,385
that's death for the man,
a terrible death.

667
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,322
But he pushed me
out of the way

668
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:19,525
and he started pressing
on my brother's chest

669
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,096
again and again
and again

670
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:27,367
until my brother
spat out

671
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:29,903
half of the Rhoyne

672
00:40:29,937 --> 00:40:31,338
and cried out.

673
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:34,741
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

674
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:43,918
I decided
two things that day.

675
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,653
I would not
waste my years

676
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:49,858
planning dances and masquerades
with the other noble ladies.

677
00:40:49,892 --> 00:40:53,328
And when
I came of age...

678
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,065
I would never live
in a slave city again.

679
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:06,040
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

680
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:09,310
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

681
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:11,746
I don't want to marry
the Frey girl.

682
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,420
I don't want you
to marry her.

683
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:23,359
But you needed
that bridge.

684
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,331
I hope it's a very
beautiful bridge.

685
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:36,433
<i>The sour cherries was all</i>
<i>crushed up and ready.</i>

686
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,642
<i>Shut up.</i>

687
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,292
<i>Probably in the piecrust</i>
<i>by now.</i>

688
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:43,173
In the oven,
the nice warm oven.

689
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:45,709
Shut up.
What did you bring?

690
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,645
The cheese
could be better.

691
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,313
I did get some
nice sausages.

692
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:52,316
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

693
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,884
He didn't say.

694
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:55,352
He just said,
"walk through the gates.

695
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:57,355
<i>What about the guards?</i>

696
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:59,124
<i>He didn't say anything</i>
<i>about the guards.</i>

697
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:00,692
What, he left that bit out?

698
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:02,327
It's a pretty important part,
don't you think?

699
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:05,497
- We have to trust him.
- <i>Trust him?</i>

700
00:43:05,531 --> 00:43:07,766
You trusted him to fight with us
and you set him free

701
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,967
- and he ran.
- I want to go back to the kitchens.

702
00:43:10,002 --> 00:43:13,038
Shut up.
Stay here if you're afraid.

703
00:43:15,808 --> 00:43:18,076
Arry, don't.

704
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:48,776
Away!
Reset!

705
00:43:56,983 --> 00:44:00,519
If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's landing in a day.

706
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:02,120
Will it hold?

707
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:04,656
Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.

708
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:08,260
<i>Again, pull!</i>

709
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:13,266
I admire you, Ser Davos.

710
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,570
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.

711
00:44:16,604 --> 00:44:18,939
Some highborn fools
call you Onion Knight

712
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,608
and think
they insult you.

713
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,944
So you take the onion
for your Sigil,

714
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:25,446
sew it on your coat,
fly the onion flag.

715
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:27,682
My son wishes me
to change it.

716
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:30,918
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

717
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:34,755
I understand why the older
families look down at me.

718
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:37,023
Do you?
Why?

719
00:44:37,058 --> 00:44:40,059
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

720
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,663
Well, sons of Lords don't like to
break bread with sons of crabbers.

721
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:45,598
Our hands stink.

722
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:48,201
And where were those Lords
when Storm's End starved?

723
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:50,537
Many fought bravely
for your brother.

724
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:53,072
Many fought
for the Mad King.

725
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:57,077
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

726
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,413
Some are happy
to do it to my face.

727
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,683
We were forgotten.

728
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:04,352
Robert and Ned Stark--
they were the heroes,

729
00:45:04,387 --> 00:45:08,089
the glorious rebels marching
from battle to battle,

730
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,725
liberating towns from
the yoke of the Mad King

731
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:13,427
while I held Storm's End
with 500 men.

732
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,395
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

733
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,530
He gave Storm's End
to Renly after the war.

734
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:19,098
Renly never fought
a day in his life.

735
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,168
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

736
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:27,673
First we ate the horses.

737
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:31,044
We weren't riding anyway,
not with the castle surrounded.

738
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:33,747
We couldn't feed them,
so fine, the horses.

739
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:35,782
Then the cats.
Never liked cats.

740
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,553
So fine.
I do like dogs.

741
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:40,221
Good animals.
Loyal.

742
00:45:40,256 --> 00:45:42,691
But we ate them.
Then the rats.

743
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:44,927
The night before
you slipped through,

744
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:46,829
I thought my wife
was dying.

745
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:49,097
She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.

746
00:45:49,132 --> 00:45:52,301
And then you made it
through the lines.

747
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:55,671
Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.

748
00:45:55,705 --> 00:45:58,473
And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.

749
00:45:58,508 --> 00:46:01,243
Every man in Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.

750
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:03,612
I was relieved
they did not.

751
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:08,784
Robert told me to hold
Storm's End, so I held it.

752
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:12,288
Then he told me
he was giving it to Renly,

753
00:46:12,323 --> 00:46:13,623
so I gave it up.

754
00:46:13,657 --> 00:46:16,059
Insult or no,
I gave it up

755
00:46:16,093 --> 00:46:18,361
because Robert was my older brother
and he was the king

756
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:20,564
and I've always
done my duty.

757
00:46:20,598 --> 00:46:24,534
But now I'm the rightful king by
every law of Westeros.

758
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:27,137
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

759
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:31,976
Your Grace...

760
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:35,847
I pray I serve you well.

761
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:40,084
I expect you'll be the first crabber's
son to wear the badge.

762
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,591
You're the master
of whisperers.

763
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:48,359
You're supposed
to know everything.

764
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:51,296
No man can be in all
rooms at all times.

765
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,366
I have many little birds
in the North, My Lord,

766
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,201
but I haven't heard
their songs

767
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:58,936
since Theon Greyjoy
captured Winterfell.

768
00:46:58,971 --> 00:47:00,572
The Stark forces
are distracted.

769
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:02,540
Now is the time
to strike.

770
00:47:02,575 --> 00:47:04,308
To strike?

771
00:47:04,343 --> 00:47:06,310
My dear nephew,
you do see these men

772
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:08,012
preparing the walls
for siege?

773
00:47:08,046 --> 00:47:11,582
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

774
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:14,017
If my Uncle Stannis lands on
the shores of King's Landing,

775
00:47:14,052 --> 00:47:16,019
I'll ride out
to greet him.

776
00:47:16,053 --> 00:47:17,954
A brave choice,
Your Grace.

777
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:20,823
I'm sure your men
will line up behind you.

778
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:23,759
They say Stannis
never smiles.

779
00:47:23,793 --> 00:47:26,461
I'll give him
a red smile

780
00:47:26,496 --> 00:47:28,630
from ear to ear.

781
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:36,005
Imagine Stannis's terror.

782
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,107
I am trying.

783
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:41,010
You're
an intelligent man.

784
00:47:41,044 --> 00:47:42,745
I'd like to think
I'm an intelligent man.

785
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,347
Oh, no one disputes
that, My Lord,

786
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:46,649
not even the multitudes
who despise you.

787
00:47:46,684 --> 00:47:49,586
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

788
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:51,455
I wish we could, too.

789
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:55,693
What do you want?

790
00:47:55,727 --> 00:47:57,929
Tell me.

791
00:47:57,963 --> 00:47:59,831
If we're going to play,

792
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:02,167
you'll have to start.

793
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:10,307
My brother was the youngest
Kingsguard in history.

794
00:48:10,342 --> 00:48:14,144
My sister became queen
at the age of 19.

795
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:17,580
When I reached manhood,

796
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:19,441
my father put me
in charge of all the drains

797
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:21,327
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

798
00:48:21,685 --> 00:48:23,719
A most highborn plumber.

799
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:25,855
The water never
flowed better.

800
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:28,825
And all the shit
found its way to the sea.

801
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:31,662
I never expected
to have any real power.

802
00:48:31,696 --> 00:48:33,898
So when my father
named me acting Hand--

803
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:36,034
You're quite good
at being Hand, you know?

804
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:38,904
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
were good men,

805
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:40,972
honorable men,

806
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:43,843
but they disdained the game
and those who played.

807
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:46,412
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

808
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:48,948
Last thing I expected.

809
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:50,449
And you play it well.

810
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:52,551
I'd like to keep
playing it.

811
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:57,990
If Stannis breaches
the gates, the game is over.

812
00:48:58,024 --> 00:49:00,658
They say he burns
his enemies alive

813
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:02,728
to honor
the Lord of Light.

814
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:05,096
The Lord of Light
wants his enemies burned,

815
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:07,632
the drowned God
wants them drowned.

816
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,668
Why are all the Gods
such vicious cunts?

817
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:13,239
Where is the God
of tits and wine?

818
00:49:13,273 --> 00:49:15,174
In the Summer Isles,

819
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,210
they worship a fertility
goddess with 16 teats.

820
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:20,913
We should sail there
immediately.

821
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,119
This morning
I heard a song

822
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:29,655
all the way from Qarth
beyond the Red Waste.

823
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,657
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

824
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,262
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

825
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:38,730
She has three dragons.

826
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,534
But even if what
they say is true,

827
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:45,503
it'll be years before
they are fully grown.

828
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:48,206
And then there will be
nowhere to hide.

829
00:49:49,709 --> 00:49:51,610
One game at a time,
my friend.

830
00:50:01,787 --> 00:50:03,954
<i>Careful, Khaleesi.</i>

831
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:06,370
<i>Xaro owns this city</i>
<i>and the warlocks have 1,000</i>

832
00:50:06,395 --> 00:50:08,160
<i>eyes watching for you.</i>

833
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,629
I found one--

834
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:14,130
a ship with
a good captain.

835
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:16,767
She leaves for
Astapor tomorrow.

836
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:18,969
- Astapor?
- We cannot stay here.

837
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:20,256
They have my dragons.

838
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:22,189
A mother does not flee
without her children.

839
00:50:22,307 --> 00:50:24,374
They're not your children.

840
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:27,010
I know they call you
the Mother of Dragons

841
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:29,813
and I know you love them, but you
didn't grow them in your womb.

842
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:32,415
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

843
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,851
And if we stay
in Qarth, we'll die.

844
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:37,954
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

845
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:43,526
You know
I would die for you.

846
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,262
I will never
abandon you.

847
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,598
I'm sworn to protect you,
to serve.

848
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,700
Then serve me.

849
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:53,031
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying,

850
00:50:53,056 --> 00:50:54,203
then take me there.

851
00:50:54,204 --> 00:50:56,105
That's what
the warlock wants.

852
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:57,941
He told you so himself.

853
00:50:57,975 --> 00:51:00,610
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

854
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:03,647
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

855
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:05,682
You saw me step
into the fire.

856
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:08,185
You watched the witch burn.
What did the flames do to me?

857
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:10,154
Do you remember?

858
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:15,427
Until my last breath
I will remember.

859
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:20,099
After I have forgotten
my mother's face.

860
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:27,040
They are my children.

861
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:31,411
And they are the only
children I will ever have.

862
00:51:37,017 --> 00:51:39,152
Take me to them.

863
00:51:50,964 --> 00:51:53,199
We should bury them.

864
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:55,534
I'd leave 'em up
a few more days.

865
00:51:55,569 --> 00:51:57,636
Sends a message.

866
00:51:57,671 --> 00:51:59,271
If they haven't got
the damn message yet,

867
00:51:59,305 --> 00:52:01,340
a few more days
won't help.

868
00:52:01,374 --> 00:52:02,975
As you say.

869
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:05,944
But it don't hurt to let
'em rot a while longer.

870
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:07,880
What's this?

871
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:10,216
Gold for the farmer.

872
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,919
For his trouble.

873
00:52:12,953 --> 00:52:14,321
His troubles are done.

874
00:52:14,355 --> 00:52:17,925
He's feeding
the crops now.

875
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:19,828
<i>His wife, too.</i>

876
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:24,533
You want to keep a man
silent, you silence him.

877
00:52:44,054 --> 00:52:47,723
Got as far as the farm
and then doubled back.

878
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,495
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

879
00:52:54,465 --> 00:52:57,800
Hoped this would be the
last place they'd think to look.

880
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,005
You're right...

881
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,741
so far.

882
00:53:04,775 --> 00:53:07,010
Who was that out there

883
00:53:07,044 --> 00:53:09,645
hung up the gates?

884
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:12,381
Must have been
the farmer's boys.

885
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,319
He killed them
and burned them

886
00:53:17,354 --> 00:53:19,955
<i>and passed them off</i>
<i>as the little lords?</i>

887
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,757
Shh, shh, shh.

888
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,426
<i>They mustn't know.</i>

889
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:27,162
<i>Bran would blame</i>
<i>himself.</i>

890
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:30,765
<i>They'll never</i>
<i>hear it from me.</i>

891
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,835
<i>The little lads</i>
<i>have suffered enough.</i>

892
00:53:43,404 --> 00:53:47,404
