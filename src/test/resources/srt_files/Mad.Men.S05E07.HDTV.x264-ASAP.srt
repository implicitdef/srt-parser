We're going to take
LSD with them.

3
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,018
You don't want to see
each other any more?

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,254
You always want to push the
button on the whole thing.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,908
Grandma Pauline is still here
and I hate her.

6
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:12,150
Stay out of her way.

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,323
Are you leaving me?

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,182
We're leaving each other,
just like you said.

9
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:17,219
I'm not a word person
like you, people.

10
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:18,917
Your words are always
"I don't like it".

11
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,275
Don, you're gonna call back
the American Cancer Society.

12
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,512
What made you
suddenly write that?

13
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,102
It was an impulse.

14
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,819
I'll be able to drive
in a few years.

15
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,210
I can come and visit.

Is Mrs. Francis
out with the mayor?

24
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:35,289
They went to Michigan
and they took baby gene

25

- Shut up.

It's on the radio all the time.

39
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:09,888
Sally, get your brother
and set the table.

40

41

No.

44

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,890
- The doorman offered.
- Why bother him?

56
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:49,727
- It's not that much.
- No, it is absurd.

- I see you brought work with you.
- It is my book.

58

I make an excuse of New York

Megan's excited about it.

60
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,134
My daughter pretends
to find interesting

61
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,003
what I find interesting
because she loves me.

I don't know.
It's exquisitely decadent.

00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:29,296
- Well, it kind of came this way.
- No, it didn't.

69
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,964
Emile is confused.

70
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:33,768
His eyes and his politics

00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,036
Well, daddy, I want
you to sit down.

Now tell me all about

Hold on, sweetheart.
It's Sally.

She's okay, but you

90
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:31,989
( Laughs ) Well, she
hardly hid her feelings.

91
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:34,191
You didn't react that way.

92
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,793
No, but I have to admit

93
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,330
I'm surprised that you're
in such a good mood.

94
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,531
It's unsatisfying, actually.

95
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,300
I always thought
she'd leave you.

96
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:45,235
I've been wondering lately
if she was just an excuse

97
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,070
to blow up my life.

98
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,472
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

99
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,707
No.

100
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,577
But I did have a, um...

101
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,780
Well, I had
a life-altering experience.

102
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,450
I'll bite.

103
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:03,618
Mona, I took LSD.

104
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,553
I went on a trip.

106
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,923
Of course you did.

107
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,193
You should really try it.
You have to.

108
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,861
You'd love it, actually.

109
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,130
So what's it like?

110
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,799
Euphoria and insight

111
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,566
and-- I don't know.

112
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,202
My whole life, people
have been telling me

113
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:23,037
I don't understand
how other people think.

114
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,538
And it turns out it's true.

115
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:27,541
- Maybe I should try it.

Are four members of
the American cancer society.

119
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:38,151
They're honoring Don for kicking lucky

00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,953
Incredible.

121
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:44,590
And what am I supposed
to do with these names?

122
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,260
You remember when
we were first married

123
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:49,195
and you used to go to luncheons

124
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,164
and tell me about these
powerful men that I could meet?

125
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,899
And you ignored me.

126
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,202
When I was in the deepest
part of the trip,

127
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,171
the farthest away,

128
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:02,641
I was sitting in my bathtub
and I saw myself

129
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,577
at the 1919 World Series.
I was playing.

130
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:08,246
Aw, you finally got
to be a baseball player.

131
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,815
Yeah, but why that game?
Why that series?

132
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,717
Because that's when
it went bad.

133
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,619
I just realized

134
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:18,622
nothing I had was mine
because the game was thrown.

135
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:22,026
Oh, Roger, please don't feel
guilty about your advantages.

136
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,627
I, for one, am not gonna let
a bunch of dirty teenagers

137
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:26,663
in the paper disrupt
the order of things.

138
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,466
I'm not.
I'm trying to meet with Firestone.

139
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:32,536
It's a huge favor, I know.

140
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,472
But I lost everything
when we lost Lucky Strike.

141
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:41,444
I thought you married Jane
because I had gotten old.

142
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,782
And then I realized
it was because you had.

143
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:50,486
I haven't had
a heart attack since.

144
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,821
Well, I don't see
what the harm could be.

145
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,490
You are still
supporting all of us.

Thank you.

find out by Friday.

Henry's mother broke her ankle.

- Oh, my goodness.
- That's terrible.

It could have been a lot worse.

159
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:49,474
Sally, you want to
tell them what happened?

160
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,076
She tripped over
one of gene's toys.

161

No, not that.

162
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,649
Sally called the police,
who called an ambulance.

163
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:59,350
<i>And while they were waiting...</i>

164
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,519
Sally, go on.

165
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:05,222
I put her foot on a pillow and
put ice on it and kept her calm.

166
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:08,192
- Oh, what a big girl.
- This is wonderful.

167
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,993
Sally doesn't like fish.

168
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:12,530
Well, as a reward,
I made spaghetti.

169
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:16,799
I always made Megan spaghetti.

170
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:20,770
That was her very favorite.

171
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:24,907
So, you two

172
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,576
will stay in the boys' room.

173
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,944
We can't put Emile
and Marie in the bunk beds.

174
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,813
( Laughs )

175
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,849
I apologize,

176
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:37,252
but we had a long voyage.

177
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,787
Good night, everyone.

178
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,791
( Speaks French )

179
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,628
Do you give a lot of shots?

180
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:50,531
Oh, I am not a medical doctor.

181
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,233
I am a professor.

182
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,570
When you have a high
degree in any field,

183
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:58,339
they call you a doctor.
It's from the middle ages.

184
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:01,375
That's right.

185
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,477
Let me just make sure
mom got settled in.

186
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,715
So, is Mr. Heinz
a down-to-earth,

187
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,617
kind of steel-town,
German-Polish,

188
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,385
drinks-beer-out-of-a-can
kind of guy?

189
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,455
No, he's boring.
He's got a daughter.

190
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,957
I think that's where he
gets all his shitty ideas.

191
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,993
Oh, who finished the shrimp?

192
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:58,062
- I asked.
- You still hungry?

193
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,996
She's got to watch herself.

194
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,532
Too much Chinese and we'll
have to go up a cup size.

195
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,968
- Shut up.
- What are you talking about?

196
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:07,036
We've been working on playtex.

197
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:08,438
Peggy's got a way
with the equipment.

198
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:09,806
( Laughs )

199
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,207
I'd love your opinion
on this, Abe.

200
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:14,344
Peggy, a traditionalist
in the bosom arena,

201
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,380
believes that we should sell
sexy bras to old ladies,

202
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:20,115
whereas I think we should sell
adult bras to young girls.

203
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,451
Abe agrees with me.
So does Don.

204
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:26,188
Well, it's not fair that just because
you're a boob-carrying consumer

205
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:28,157
that your opinion means more.

206
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:31,193
You know what? I should take off.
I've got a deadline.

207
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:33,728
And, honestly, I didn't
have enough dinner.

208
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:36,063
- I should go home.
- Oh, okay.

209
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,835
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Good night.

210
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,904
Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,310
He's too good-looking
for you.

212
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,918
My father won't care if he
finds out you read James Bond.

213
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,722
You know what?
This is a good book.

214
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:04,256
- You should read it.
- ( Laughs )

215
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,928
Your father said they'll sightsee
with the kids during the day

216
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:11,897
and watch them when we go out
with Heinz tomorrow night.

217
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,099
You'll have to give
me some cash.

218
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,035
He won't even buy
himself a pretzel.

219
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:22,341
And they can watch them the
night of the cancer dinner.

220
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,109
That's the whole reason
they came down,

221
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:28,213
- to see you get the award.
- They came to see you.

222
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,849
And your father's got a
meeting with some publishers.

223
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:33,785
One publisher.
We'll call the sitter.

224
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,887
Francis the talking mule?

225
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:38,989
Don't you want them to come?

226
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,529
I don't think anything's
gonna make him like me.

227
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,931
Because I'm his favorite.

228
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,801
Why do you think my mother
is so competitive?

229
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,268
I didn't see that.

230
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:54,371
Didn't you notice
she touched you

231
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:56,373
six times in an hour?

232
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,475
She's French.

233
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,944
No, that's not what that is.

234
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:07,549
Well...

235
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:09,852
- Goodnight.
- ( Chuckles )

236
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,921
They'll be gone on Sunday.

237
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,619
Do you have a minute?

238
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Lock that and get Dawn to hold
my calls so you can have five.

239
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,924
No, pervert.
This is about work.

240
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,992
I think it is, anyway.

241
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,061
I think I have an idea.

242
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,497
It might be really good.

243
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,733
But it might be terrible.

244
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:51,204
Well, you've established
a firm bed of insecurity.

245
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,305
Okay.

246
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,708
Last night when I was
feeding the kids spaghetti,

247
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,344
I realized that my mother
had made it for me

248
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,812
and that her mother
had made it for her.

249
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,783
And I got this picture
in my head of her becoming me

250
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,753
<i>like with one of those</i>
<i>movie dissolves.</i>

251
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,688
And then this morning
in the shower,

252
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,857
I realized you could
take it all the way back

253
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,293
to cavemen and then
do the middle ages,

254
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,262
the renaissance,
all the way up to now

255
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,098
and then the future,
like a colony

256
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,369
on the moon and you see
earth out the window.

257
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,503
That's very good.

258
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:28,605
But we don't sell spaghetti.

259
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,975
No, Heinz baked beans.

260
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,710
Oh.

261
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,313
It solves a lot
of problems, doesn't it?

262
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:39,716
( Chuckles )

263
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,617
My God.

264
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,185
Get over here.

265
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:46,188
No, I don't want
to change the subject.

266
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:49,325
I'm not changing the subject.

267
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:52,595
What are we showing tomorrow?

268
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,229
Human cannonball.

269
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:56,299
I mean, it's funny
and I loved it,

270
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,732
but...

271
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,969
Dawn, get Stan and Ginsberg
in here right away.

272
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:05,006
Oh, they're gonna hate me.
Tell them it was your idea.

273
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,509
You don't really want me
to do that, do you?

274
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:08,976
No.

275
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:12,146
"Kids want beans
and they have forever."

276
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:14,915
Oh, I had something like,

277
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,485
"Heinz beans,
some things never change."

278
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,154
Jesus, I think that's better.

279
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:26,627
- You rang?
- I'm gonna need both of you on Surrette.

280
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,762
We're changing Heinz.

281
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,898
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>Mr. Drexler for you.</i>

282
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,569
Thank you, Patricia.

283
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:39,739
- Hello?
- How's Minetta tavern sound for dinner?

284
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,774
It's Thursday.
Not good.

285
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:44,610
- You're gonna eat anyway.
- Well, come by.

286
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:48,179
I'm not coming by. I can't talk to
you there and I don't want to wait.

287
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,717
Oh, okay.

288
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:54,085
I could meet you early

7:00.
I'll see you there.

291

Ginsberg: She couldn't have been
struck by lightning a week ago?

292
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:03,026
You think that's her idea?

293
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,764
What happened?

294
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,932
Boss's wife had an idea.

295
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:12,236
- Is it any good?
- It's better than what we had.

296
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,072
Good for her.

297
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,308
- <i>( Knocks )</i>

298
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:23,346
I'm supposed to be in the
final mix for Vicks tonight

299
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,383
and I need to switch it.
It's very important.

300
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,185
Who scheduled it.

301
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,521
I have something else to do.

302

Well, that almost never
happens, so don't feel bad.

It doesn't, does it?

304
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:39,929

Do you want to close the door?

I thought everything
was going great, but...

308
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,551
Now I have this terrible
feeling about Abe.

309
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:06,987
I think he's gonna end it.

310
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:08,522
Why?

311
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,557
He wants to have dinner

312
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:12,526
and he knows
weeknights are hard.

313
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,827
And we just saw
each other last night.

314
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,230
And he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

315
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:25,104
Well, it's been my experience

316
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,007
that when a man insists on a meal,
he has something important to say.

317
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:32,744
It's usually a proposal.

318
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:35,981
Really?

319
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,584
Well, that's you.

320
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:41,954
Men don't take
the time to end things.

321
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:43,822
They ignore you

322
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,857
until you insist on
a declaration of hate.

323
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:48,960
Someone dumped you?

324
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:51,095
Peggy, I'm just like
everybody else.

325
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:55,132
If he's going to end it,
which I doubt,

326
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,134
you'll know what to do.

327
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:00,371
If he's going to propose, you'd
better have your answer prepared,

328
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,638
especially if it's no.

329
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,576
Gosh.

330
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:14,017
I should go home
and change, shouldn't I?

331
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:16,252
Or better yet,

332
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,953
go shopping.

333
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,498
So the mom's wearing
the glass space helmet

334
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:31,633
and the kid took his off
and put it on the table?

335
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,534
That way, the kid
can eat the beans.

336
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:35,203
And I thought you
could do the whole thing

337
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,571
with the same actors
playing mother and child.

338
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:39,840
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>Mr. Sterling's here to see you.</i>

339
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:46,514
Oh, you two
are actually working.

340
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,616
Go break it into frames
and have Stan draw it up.

341
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,123
I've been working
this morning, too.

342
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,291
You mean you finished yours,
you're moving onto mine?

343
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:01,128
No, I've been in
the war room, Don,

344
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:03,630
preparing for the American
Cancer dinner.

345
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:07,033
Caroline went to the library and
got me pictures of these guys.

346
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,735
I'm $50 away
from a seating chart.

347
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,137
Look, I don't take
this honor lightly.

348
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:12,638
Good.
Say something like that.

349
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:15,341
Titans of industry
are giving you an award.

350
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,010
We are being lowered in a
bucket into a gold mine.

351
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:20,646
I'm gonna bring my pick and
crack something off the wall.

352
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,914
I don't think it's
that kind of atmosphere.

353
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:25,716
You actually saying that
with a straight face?

354
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,785
You forget why
you wrote that letter?

355
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,620
Are you forgetting you said
it would kill our business?

356
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:30,955
So you think cigarettes are bad

357
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,157
and so are the people
who sell them?

358
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,791
It's what they think.

359
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:36,294
Mary Lasker and the rest of
them know it as the truth.

360
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,894
It doesn't matter
why I wrote it.

361
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:39,463
You're right.

362
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,565
Who knows why people
in history did good things?

363
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,601
For all we know, Jesus was trying to
get the loaves and fishes account.

364
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:48,238
I'll do what I can, but I'm
not gonna go overboard.

365
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,940
My in-laws don't think
I'm Jesus.

366
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:51,408
They'll be clapping
and cheering.

367
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:52,576
They don't know
you're a hypocrite.

368
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,377
Megan's father is a communist.

369
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,745
- What?
- He's a socialist

370
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,781
or a maoist or some ideology

371
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:04,087
plus, you know, I'm
sleeping with his daughter.

372
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,521
So he'll see you shaking hands.

373
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,056
You know,
it's very interesting,

374
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,291
but a lot of times you think
people are looking at you,

375
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,659
but they're not.
Their mind's elsewhere.

376
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,762
Lots of people that haven't taken LSD.
Already know that, Roger.

377
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:16,431
You're gonna be like
an Italian bride--

378
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,167
People lining up
to give you envelopes.

379
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:24,339
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

380
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,788
- You look good.
- Thank you.

381
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,236
The steak is supposed
to be good here.

382
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,637
The menu's huge.

383
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:55,075
The service is incredible, but I told
them to leave us alone a second.

384
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:58,143
Can I get a drink?

385
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,979
Yeah, sure.

386
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,646
I guess I can get
somebody's attention.

387
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,217
No.

388
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,785
Forget it.

389
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,823
What do you want to say?

390
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,525
Okay.

391
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,229
I've been thinking about this.

392
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:21,465
We're at a place where
we love being together.

393
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,935
It always seems to be
some kind of pain in the ass

394
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,970
to be in the same place
when the lights go out.

395
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,540
Oh, my God.

396
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:31,909
Yeah, well,

397
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:35,512
I think we should
move in together.

398
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,983
I mean, how would
we ever do that?

399
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:41,618
Well, however you want.

400
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,954
I mean, I think your place
would be better.

401
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:47,890
It's because that's how I feel.

402
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,525
I just like the idea
of the two of us

403
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,894
waking up in the same
place every day.

404
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,930
The two of us writing
together in the same room,

405
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:56,498
looking at each other
every once in a while.

406
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,434
Grocery shopping.

407
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:03,405
Look,

408
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,240
I know it's a big decision.

409
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:08,476
So you don't have to say
yes or no right now.

410
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:13,348
Maybe we should order.

411
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:19,987
Oh, excuse me.

412
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,690
Yes.

413
00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:29,763
You've made me so happy.

414
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:32,199
Me, too.

415
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,303
You still want to eat?

416
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:40,006
I do.

417
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:46,479
Actually, my father is on the board
of the American cancer society.

418
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,881
Although he said the voting
was unanimous for Don.

419
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,582
Well, that is quite an honor.

420
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:53,085
And as much as we
appreciate the invitation,

421
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,652
we're heading back
to Pittsburgh

422
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,855
the minute I leave
your office smiling.

423
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,823
You're really gonna rush off?

424
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:01,158
I think Ken got you tickets to the new
Edward Albee play.

425
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:04,228
- Oh, we saw it on Tuesday.
- You did?

426
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, we came in
a couple days early.

427
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:12,203
Alice loves the city.
Did I not mention that?

428
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:14,671
No reason to, I guess.

429
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,206
Raymond, would you
order me a sanka?

430
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,741
I'm gonna freshen up.

431
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:21,244
And some dessert.

432
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:22,913
Come on, why not?

433
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:26,249
You know, I've always
wanted to eat here.

434
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:28,451
I thought it was just
for time life employees.

435
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:29,852
( Chuckles )

436
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,027
You know, I really enjoy
spending time with you.

437
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:40,730
I feel the same way, Alice.

438
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:44,534
I'm only saying this because Raymond's
putting on such a good show.

439
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,501
He didn't want to go to dinner.

440
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,670
He just wanted to
do it in your office.

441
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:50,972
He's a good man, I swear.

442
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,908
Of course he is.

443
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:54,943
I was really prepared
to not like you,

444
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:57,145
but you're so good
for that man.

445
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,381
- And you're so lively.
- Thank you, Alice.

446
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,483
I'm just saying I hope we
can continue to be friends.

447
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,324
No, see, the truth in packaging
bill they wanted to pass

448
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,361
would hit everybody hard,
but now there's no teeth.

449
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:16,329
So nothing should change.

450
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,801
( Whispers )
We're getting fired.

451
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:30,543
Sorry, but we ended up getting more
dessert than we bargained for.

452
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,378
Who's up for a nightcap?

453
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,012
That's okay.
I think we're gonna turn in.

454
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:36,582
Do me the favor, Raymond.

455
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,416
You don't know this,
but you've rescued me

456
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,351
from a house full
of in-laws and children.

457
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,588
Can we get a bottle of
sauternes and six glasses?

458
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:46,491
I don't know. We have the early
meeting tomorrow and the flight back.

459
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,360
You know, Don jokes about
having a house full of people,

460
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,730
but he loves it.
Don?

461
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,367
Don, tell him about last night.

462
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,076
Oh, well,

463
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,344
we had three generations
under one roof--

464
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,647
Megan, her mother
and my 12-year-old Sally.

465
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:13,349
Sally won't eat anything,
as you might imagine.

466
00:24:13,383 --> 00:24:16,152
Except beans, of course.
( Laughs )

467
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,553
It's true.

468
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:19,188
They do like them.

469
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,824
Never had any worries
about that.

470
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,726
You should have seen it--
Megan bringing the pot in,

471
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,861
spooning them out on the plate,
her mother was smiling.

472
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:27,930
- What a darling scene.
- Actually, I didn't know

473
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:30,866
if I had done something wrong
because Don was staring at us.

474
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,369
But apparently
I'd given him this idea.

475
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:36,538
She did.

476
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:39,440
Don, you sure you want
to talk about this now?

477
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:41,075
Let him talk.

478
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:45,246
Obviously there's more to it,
but I think it would be

479
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,915
a series of one-shot
little movies.

480
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,052
One mother starting
in the prehistoric caves

481
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:54,087
serving beans to a shaggy
little boy by the fire.

482
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:56,356
Then a Greek woman

483
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,192
in a toga with
a little shepherd boy.

484
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:01,461
Then Marie Antoinette
to a little prince.

485
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:03,462
Mary Jane to a pioneer boy.

486
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:06,499
All the way through
the gay '90s to today

487
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,902
in a kitchen like yours.

488
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:11,336
Would it all be the same
mother and child?

489
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,675
We hadn't thought of that,
but that might work.

490
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:18,210
Tell him the rest of it.

491
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:20,913
Well, it goes past
present day to the future

492
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:24,016
to a little lunar kitchen with
the earth off in the window.

493
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:27,552
You know, futuristic
clothing, interesting bowls.

494
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:30,288
The kid has just taken off
his space helmet

495
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,256
as he takes a warm bite.

496
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,225
Oh, that's clever.

497
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:35,660
That was Megan's idea.

498
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:37,595
When Don told me, I thought,

499
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:39,564
we're all so busy
and we rush around

500
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:41,666
and it will probably
always be like that.

501
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,735
But a mother and child

502
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:47,871
and dinner--
That'll never change.

503
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,575
"Heinz beans,

504
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:53,844
some things never change."

505
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:56,013
- Can I get some more coffee?
- Shh!

506
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:00,516
I don't know what to say.

507
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,454
Let me think about it.
See the pictures.

508
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:07,356
Raymond, really?
It's beautiful.

509
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,826
And it's exactly--

510
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,228
I don't know.
Can I get the cream, please?

511
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:18,066
Well, we were dancing around
a few other things, too.

512
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:20,869
No, we weren't.
This is what you're gonna see tomorrow.

513
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,871
It's a once-in-a-lifetime idea.

514
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:25,573
Raymond, you could save yourself
a trip to the office tomorrow

515
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:28,610
or we can get in the
elevator, go down 11 floors

516
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:30,778
and show you
the work right now.

517
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:35,282
It's the future.

518
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:37,684
That's all I ever wanted.

519
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:42,223
Should we change that
sauternes to champagne?

520
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:46,359
Sure, why the hell not?

521
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,694
( All laughing )

522

72nd and Park.

523
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:05,244
Do you know you're good
at all of it?

524
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:07,345
You had the idea

525
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,016
feeding me the pitch, knowing to
pull the trigger at that moment.

526
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,852
I was just gonna scream
in his stupid face.

527
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:15,954
I'm glad you didn't.

528
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:18,156
I love the way you sold that.

529
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,158
Oh, my God.

530
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:23,261
I want you.

531
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,364
But we have to go
back to the house

532
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,034
with the kids and your parents.

533
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:34,437
We can go back to the office.

534
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:37,340
Change of plans.
Back to time life, please.

<i>( Men laughing )</i>

536

There's champagne
in the conference room.

537
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,532
Don and Megan sold Heinz
last night over dinner.

538
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:08,236
But, by looking
at your fingers,

539
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,371
maybe you're not
in the mood to celebrate.

540
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,841
No, of course.

541
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:17,011
It was better than that.

Really?

We're moving in together.

My goodness.

No, Peggy.

Really?

551
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,564
You're not just saying that?

552
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:42,301
No.
I don't know.

553
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:45,905
Sounds like he wants to be
with you no matter what.

554
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,609
I thought you were going
to be disappointed for me.

555
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:52,644
I think it's very romantic.

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,946
It is, isn't it?

557
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:59,684
We don't need a piece of paper.

558
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:02,220
I mean, not that marriage
is wrong or anything.

559
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,422
Greg has a piece of paper
with the US Army

560
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,225
that's more important
than the one he has with me.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Then they just passed it back and
forth like a couple of pros.

Joan told me Harry said
you signed Heinz.

all the credit.

Why aren't you
jumping up and down?

I know what you did
and it is a big deal.

acted like it happens all the time.

It doesn't.

Wait.

637
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:20,179
Hi, ma.
Come in.

638
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:22,114
Hello, peaches.

639
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:23,949
Abraham.

640
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:25,917
Hello, Katherine.

641
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:28,586
Oh, you brought dessert.

642
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:30,421
Just leave it in the box.
I'll take it out.

643
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:32,089
It's very delicate.

644
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,160
You want some sherry?

645
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:36,827
Sure.

646
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:41,266
Smells good in here.

647
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,501
Peggy made a ham.
It's my favorite.

648
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:45,169
Really?

- Hello.
- Hello.

652
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:02,618
Roger Sterling, this is Dr.
Emile and Marie Calvet.

653
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:04,654
You ladies look ravishing.

- Thank you.
- Megan: <i>Can I get you a drink?</i>

655
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,757
Uh, no.
I mean, yes.

656
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,959
But does anyone know
how to tie this thing?

657
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:13,162
- Here.
- I'm stag tonight

658
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,164
and my doorman
wears a clip-on.

659
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,567
I am surprised.

660
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,136
You seem like you were
born in a bow tie.

661
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:24,138
I didn't tie that one either.

Sally:
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:30,445
My God.

665
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:37,084
Sally, you look so beautiful.

666
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:40,787
- ( Speaks French )
- You're beautiful, sweetheart.

Emile: <i>Don, there is
nothing you can do.</i>

No matter what, one day
your little girl

669
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:47,494
will spread her legs
and fly away.

( Roger laughs )

671
00:34:49,263 --> 00:34:51,797
- What? It's true.
- Wings, daddy.

672
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,068
Take off the makeup
and the boots.

673
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,204
What? No.

674
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,673
Or you can stay home.

675
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,543
Fine.

676
00:35:14,186 --> 00:35:16,121
This is the ballroom?

677
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,156
There's no staircase.

678
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,824
But here's a handsome prince.

679
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:23,394
Nah.

680
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:25,563
Hello, all.
Don't you look lovely?

681
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:28,031
I hope you don't mind if I steal
your father for a moment.

682
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,967
I'd love for you
to meet Ed Baxter.

683
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,002
- Ken's father-in-law.
- No, of course.

684
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:34,472
Megan, could you join us?

685
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:36,473
I got 'em.

686
00:35:39,477 --> 00:35:41,811
Ed, Don Draper, his wife Megan.

687
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:45,014
Pleased to meet you.
Both of you.

688
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:46,783
I guess I should
thank you for this.

689
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:50,420
No, don't thank me.
I had to recuse myself.

690
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:52,788
But you write
some stirring copy.

691
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:56,325
Actually, Megan's a hell
of a copywriter as well.

692
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:58,894
Well, I should lie,
but Cynthia told me

693
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:00,862
all about your dinner.

694
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:04,232
- She's a natural.
- Thank you.

695
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,072
- Who's he?
- His name is Ed. He's at dow corning.

696
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:15,610
They make beautiful dishes,
glassware, napalm.

697
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,712
- Peter Campbell.
- Emile.

698
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,480
And his wife's name is Lillian.

699
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,949
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.

700
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:25,852
And those two over there, the
balding guy with Margaret Dumont,

701
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:28,388
he's at GM.
Where's your purse?

702
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,891
You're gonna be my date.

703
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,160
Every business card
I bring back,

704
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,863
you're gonna put it in your purse
and say "go get 'em, tiger."

705
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:41,600
- So I manage those accounts.
- I don't understand.

706
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:44,770
What do you do every day?

707
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:46,772
Well, what do you do?

708
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:49,408
You're a scholar
and an intellectual, right?

709
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,144
Yes.

710
00:36:51,178 --> 00:36:53,880
Actually, from what I hear,
you're a bit of a trailblazer.

711
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:57,415
I don't know if that's true.

712
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,385
I bet the world would be better off if
they knew about the work you're doing.

713
00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:04,022
You are very kind.

714
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,292
That, Emile,

715
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,728
is what I do every day.

716
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:13,197
Ah.
( Laughs )

717
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,399
Shit.
I've got to beat the entree.

718
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,202
Cover me.

719
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:21,739
Your dad is very resourceful.

720
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,431
Please.
I got this.

721
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,069
I'm sorry, honey.
I wasn't gonna leave before dessert,

722
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,971
but this is taking a little
longer than I thought.

723
00:37:58,177 --> 00:37:59,977
Well...

724
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:06,083
We have something
we want to tell you.

725
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,985
Really?

726
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,356
Abe and I are very
serious about each other

727
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,225
and we've decided we're
going to live together.

728
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,427
What?

729
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,096
Listen. I know
you may not approve,

730
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,667
but it's important to me
that you understand

731
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,136
what we're doing.

732
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,672
I will take
very good care of her.

733
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:34,076
You know what?

734
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,711
I'm gonna go.

735
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:37,913
What?

736
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:39,982
I'm gonna go.

737
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:42,117
I need my cake.

738
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:43,486
Why?

739
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,454
Because I'm not
giving you a cake

740
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,955
to celebrate youse
living in sin.

741
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:51,125
Would you rather
I not tell you?

742
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,728
Yeah. You want to
stick it in my face?

743
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:56,931
Just lie. You think you're the
first ones ever to do this?

744
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:02,836
- Ma.
- What do you want from me?

745
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,373
I'm gonna get you a cab.

746
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:10,611
I invited you here as an adult

747
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:13,747
because I didn't want to lie
and I want you in my life.

748
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,617
Well, if you're an adult,
why do you care what I think?

749
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:18,984
I thought you'd be relieved
I wasn't marrying the Jew.

750
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:21,654
It has nothing to do with that!

751
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:23,556
It's my fault.

752
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,326
Because once your father died, there
was no one to set you straight.

753
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,160
I know what I'm doing.

754
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:30,263
And I think daddy would
want me to be happy.

755
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:33,799
No. He'd be mad at you
the same way I am

756
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:36,368
because you are selling
yourself short.

757
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:40,139
This boy, he will
use you for practice

758
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:43,109
until he decides to get
married and have a family.

759
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:45,711
And he will, believe me.

760
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:49,414
You want me to be alone?

761
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,854
You know what
your aunt used to say?

762
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:01,793
You're lonely, get a cat.

763
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:04,763
They live 13 years,

764
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:07,765
then you get another one and
another one after that.

765
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,833
Then you're done.

766
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,103
Thank you for dinner.

767
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,345
Woman: <i>All of us here appreciate
your years of service.</i>

768
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,547
Ooh, baked Alaska.
It's flaming, but they probably don't want

769
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:26,949
- to wreck the speeches.
- You're wrecking the speeches.

770
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:30,387
- You're a mean drunk. You know that?
- ( Marie laughs )

<i>From the Sterling Cooper Draper
Pryce advertising firm...</i>

772

- Oh, your daddy's next.
- <i>Mr. Donald Draper.</i>

773

( Applause )

774
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,029
Thank you.

775
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,168
Shouldn't I be at his side?

776
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,003
Go get 'em, tiger.

777
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,148
Can I see it?

778
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,325
Do you want it?

779
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,660
No, you should keep it because
it makes you really happy.

780
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:18,465
You know what makes me happy?

781
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:20,434
A beautiful young lady
who will someday

782
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,536
be wearing makeup,
but not today.

783
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,476
I got you a shirley temple.

784
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,678
It's time to start
tapering off.

785
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,847
And, Don, I promised Frank
from Ford over there

786
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,615
you'd come and say hi.

787
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,169
I'd buy you a drink, but I
think they're still free.

788
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:02,172
I have been watching
you all night.

789
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:07,778
You're so full of life
and ambition.

790
00:42:07,812 --> 00:42:09,346
Well, I've gotten
a lot of rejection,

791
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:11,047
so who knows what I'm full of?

792
00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:14,351
( Laughs ) When I was younger,

793
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:17,720
it was my spirit
to try everything,

794
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:19,722
get a taste,
know what was what,

795
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:22,625
and never be sorry
for making the mistakes.

796
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,960
And then one day,

797
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:27,697
I made too many mistakes.

798
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:29,732
- Where was I that day?
- ( Laughs )

799
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:32,967
Inside you is a little boy.

800
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:35,036
Well, Marie, I woke up one day

801
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,441
and I realized at what point
should you ever stop trying?

802
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:44,345
I agree.

803
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,581
We should have
everything we want.

804
00:42:50,286 --> 00:42:53,021
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Can you watch the award?

805
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,688
I got it.

806
00:43:03,198 --> 00:43:05,832
Daddy, I'm glad you came.

807
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:08,201
Then why do you look so sad?

808
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:11,405
I'm not.
I'm just tired.

809
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,840
It's been a busy week.

810
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,843
Yes, you have
a big beans success.

811
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:20,112
Don't make fun, papa.
I know you don't approve.

812
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:23,349
Is this your passion?

813
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:25,952
( Speaking French )

814
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:29,221
Because you have changed.

815
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:31,190
I always thought
you were very single-minded

816
00:43:31,224 --> 00:43:34,193
about your dreams and that that
would help you through life.

817
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:37,295
But now I see that you
skipped the struggle

818
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,597
and went right to the end.

819
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:42,533
It's not the end.
It's the beginning.

820
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:46,137
This apartment, this wealth
that someone handed to you,

821
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:48,539
this was what Karl Marx
was talking about.

822
00:43:48,574 --> 00:43:51,076
And it's not because
someone else deserves it,

823
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,078
it's because it is
bad for your soul.

824
00:43:54,112 --> 00:43:55,980
Don't beat me
with your politics

825
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:58,314
because you hate
that I love Don.

826
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:01,351
No, I hate that you gave up.

827
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:04,653
Don't let your love
for this man

828
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:06,789
stop you from doing
what you wanted to do.

829
00:44:06,823 --> 00:44:09,692
( Speaking French )

830
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:44,691
- Excuse me.
- Ed: <i>I've been telling Ken</i>

831
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:47,027
you should get out of
your business altogether.

832
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:48,895
Why is that?

833
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:55,801
I'd introduce you to him,

834
00:44:55,836 --> 00:44:57,870
but I don't want you
to waste your time.

835
00:44:57,905 --> 00:44:59,839
He's on the board.

836
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:02,141
- He obviously likes my work.
- He loves your work.

837
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:04,544
They all do.

838
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:06,646
But they don't like you.

839
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,114
- What?
- This crowd,

840
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:11,684
they'll bury
your desk in awards,

841
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:14,186
but they'll never
work with you,

842
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,355
not after that letter.

843
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,156
I mean, how could
they trust you

844
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,824
after the way you bit the hand?

845
00:45:23,663 --> 00:45:26,631
Oh, sorry about that.

846
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,533
You want another?

847
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,871
Yeah, sure.

848
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:35,405
Two.

849
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:06,069
- Excuse me, miss. Are you
finished with that? - Yes.

850
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:17,679
- Glen: <i>Yeah?</i>
- Did I wake you?

851
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:19,215
<i>Yeah, but it's okay.</i>

852
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,383
I get a lot of attention
every time you call.

853
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:23,718
People think
you're my girlfriend.

854
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm not.

855
00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:27,855
Why are you whispering?

856
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,258
I'm in Manhattan at my dad's.

857
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,327
Bluto broke her foot.

858
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:34,429
( Laughs ) Spectacular.

859
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:36,498
Yeah.

860
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:39,199
How's the city?

861
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:41,835
Dirty.

862
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:50,348
