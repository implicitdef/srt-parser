1
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,465
They got
Honey Nut Cheerios in here?

2
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,737
Shit.

3
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,488
Yo, back the fuck up,
motherfucker!

4
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,615
My man here
saved my spot, yo.

5
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,495
It's a shame we don't have
more time together.

6
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,696
We could have made us
a couple of babies.

7
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,493
Ain't nobody see shit.

8
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,300
- How's that for a message?
- Not bad.

9
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,965
Except the price
on your head ain't for four figures--

10
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,735
- it's for five.
- Shit. For that kind of money,

11
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,366
I should have done you
my own self.

12
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,468
So who's doing
the bounty?

13
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,639
Who it is: A West Side player
by the name of Marlo.

14
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,148
Marlo? Can't say
I know the man.

15
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,346
- He know you.
- Can you get me a phone call?

16
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,149
I can do you one
better than that.

17
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,990
Who you calling?

18
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,519
- Police.
- The police?

19
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,397
Man owe me a favor.

20
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,734
...crime, violence, drugs,

21
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,644
drug addiction,
failing schools--

22
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,547
all of these social problems
in Baltimore City

23
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,312
over and over again.

24
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,319
And on June 8th,

25
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,480
when I had to write
a column for the next day,

26
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,389
some statistics had just come out
from the FBl showing

27
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,484
an uptick in some
of Baltimore's crime.

28
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,995
And we also had
a spate of five killings

29
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,191
in a two-
or three-day period.

30
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,258
And, you know, the idea
of sitting down again

31
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,930
and writing another column
on this subject--

32
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,598
I don't know
if it is important.

33
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,766
But here I am
a citizen of Baltimore,

34
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,608
and I take my citizenship as seriously
as I take my credentials as a columnist.

35
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,274
I said, "What am I gonna say?
What can I say about this?"

36
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,943
If the killings continue--

37
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,351
between 250 and 300
homicides a year...

38
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,356
- Top of the world.
- Top of the world.

39
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,120
I knocked off an incumbent major, Tony.
That ain't easy.

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,458
National party has to
take note of this.

41
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,226
Young and pretty as you are,
I'm sure they've got ideas.

42
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,326
All you have to do now
is run the city.

43
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,133
Tony, I've got to ask
you something:

44
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,299
Why didn't you run again
after the first term?

45
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,141
I mean, nobody had the--
the name you had, the organization.

46
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,976
Let me tell you
a story, Tommy.

47
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,882
The first day I became mayor,
they sit me down at the desk--

48
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,819
big chair and dark wood,

49
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,322
Iots of beautiful things.

50
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,225
I'm thinking,
"How much better can it get?"

51
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,161
There's a knock at the door
in the corner of the room,

52
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,324
and Pete comes walking in

53
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,698
carrying this gorgeous

54
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,330
S�vres silver bowl,
hand chased.

55
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,203
It was this big.

56
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,538
"It's from the unions,"
he says.

57
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,838
So I think
it's a present,

58
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,210
something to commemorate
my first day as mayor.

59
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,807
And he walks over,
puts it on a desk.

60
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,081
I look down at it.

61
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,485
It's disgusting.

62
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,684
I said, "What the hell is this?"

63
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,851
He said,
"What the hell's it look like?"

64
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,693
I said,
"lt looks like shit.

65
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,664
Well, what do you want me
to do with it?"

66
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,135
He says, "Eat it."

67
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,227
"Eat it?"

68
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,567
He says, "Yeah.

69
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,163
You're the mayor.

70
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,367
You've got to eat it."

71
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,740
So, okay.

72
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,746
It was my first day,
and Pete knows more than I do.

73
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,145
So I go at it.

74
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,481
And just when I finish,
there's a knock on the door.

75
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,977
And in walks Pete carrying
another silver bowl,

76
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,580
and this one's
from the blacks.

77
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,818
"This too?"

78
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,520
And he nods. I start eating.

79
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,085
And when I'm finished,

80
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,791
there's another knock
and another bowl.

81
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,595
This one's
from the Polacks.

82
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,229
Then after that,
one from the ministers.

83
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,738
And you know what, Tommy?

84
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,330
That's what it is.

85
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,105
You're sitting, eating shit
all day long, day after day,

86
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,702
year after year.

87
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,838
When I realized that,

88
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,247
I decided being
a downtown lawyer

89
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:36,244
and seeing my family
every night made for a fine life.

90
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,156
Just a fine life.

91
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,285
Got that dark horse
right here, man.

92
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,386
O.G. dark horse.

93
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,466
Man, everyone knows
his nigga ain't about to cop, is he?

94
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,367
Spider, Spider,
hold on now.

95
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,038
Come on, man.

96
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,206
Why you ain't come past
my gym no more?

97
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,443
I been waiting on you
for weeks now.

98
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,748
Talk to me, son.

99
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,777
You ain't my fuckin' father.

100
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,315
What happened between
me and your mom

101
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,089
ain't got shit to do with you
taking advantage of the gym.

102
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,927
Now, man, I'm just saying
you one of my best, boy.

103
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,435
Hell, if I thought it
was gonna hurt you, I wouldn't--

104
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,437
Fuck you! Ain't nobody
gonna hurt me.

105
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,907
Fuck you. So step up
and step off, unc.

106
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,136
I got customers
backing up.

107
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,472
Dark horse,
dark horse.

108
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,809
Five, and five more.

109
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,288
Shit. That's what that does.

110
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,759
Principal Withers,
please to the cafeteria.

111
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,124
Yo, last card down.
Remember?

112
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,389
Oh yeah.
My bad.

113
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,326
Hey, guys.

114
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,033
You know I don't mind you
coming up here most days

115
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,565
to eat lunch, but I said
you can't be gambling.

116
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,637
Yo, Mr. Prezbo, the quarter's
only a, you know, reminder

117
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,876
to remind me
that I got 25 shells.

118
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,613
That's all. Come on,
let's see what you've got.

119
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,520
Dang. Flush.

120
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,751
- But it don't beat your three nines.
- Yeah, it do.

121
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,055
- It do?
- It do.

122
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,027
It does.

123
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,828
Karim, you should have been more
cautious with your bet. Figure the odds.

124
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,198
Yo, it's our lunch break.
Don't be schooling us now.

125
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,793
Hold on.
Let him talk.

126
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,772
Well, for starters,
you have to get a count on the diamonds.

127
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,275
You know how many diamonds
there are in a deck?

128
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,470
13.

129
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,810
13-- that's right. Cards is
all about knowing the numbers.

130
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,111
With the numbers,
you can calculate the odds.

131
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,675
Now, Michael had
four diamonds showing.

132
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,743
Hold on. Wait.

133
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,118
What about dice?

134
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,680
I mean, does dice
have odds too?

135
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,352
'Cause mostly
that's what we play.

136
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,123
- Dice?
- Yeah. Sure.

137
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,688
So, can you show us
the odds of dice?

138
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,292
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, man. Teach us dice.

139
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,962
- That'd be hard, man.
- For real.

140
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,870
Here comes that
Jailhouse Rick.

141
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,464
The Braddock case?

142
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,136
I take it we now have permission
to solve this fucking case,

143
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,476
seeing as everyone's
finished voting.

144
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,175
Solve away,
you bold centurions.

145
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,117
You don't have
work to do?

146
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,661
Not till I catch
a fresh call, no.

147
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,688
How much can you
sell that one for?

148
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,260
Mint condition, 300.

149
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,362
Fuck me.
I need a hobby.

150
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,204
That's right,

151
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,903
but he bucked on me.

152
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,607
I just thought he might have
come back past once or twice.

153
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,673
Sherrod's on a truant list,
Mr. Cousins.

154
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,150
He hasn't been back since
the last time you brought him in.

155
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,112
Well, if he does
come back past,

156
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,283
can you tell him
I'm looking for him at home,

157
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,917
and he can come
home if he want?

158
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,990
I apologize
for taking your time.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,865
I see you up here undercover.

160
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,392
All right.
Don't worry, dawg.

161
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,995
I'll keep it close.

162
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,339
Mrs. Donnelly?
Does the school have

163
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,313
any kind of collection
of board games--

164
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,646
Parcheesi,
Trouble, Monopoly?

165
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,982
You're still teaching
eighth-grade math, right?

166
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,850
Trying. Yeah.

167
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,492
The book room downstairs.

168
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,828
Stay on the curriculum,
Mr. Pryzbylewski,

169
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,392
or you'll have an area superintendent
on our backs.

170
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,461
Remember this, yo?

171
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,375
Not in my case.

172
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:54,311
Them boys working the case
ain't really in the mood to listen.

173
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,213
As you can see, I still got
the lady-lawyer marker,

174
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,776
and if I recall, a police gun
got fired a while back.

175
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,913
Only reason I'm even here
is because of that gun.

176
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,185
As far as llene Nathan goes,

177
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,627
she promised a get-out-of-jail-free
on a small felony or two.

178
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,758
This here is a taxpayer murder
with an eyeball witness.

179
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,131
The eyeball witness
is lying, yo. Come on now.

180
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,295
When have you ever known me
to put my gun on anybody

181
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,328
- that wasn't in the gang?
- Oh. Omar.

182
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,237
Old Face Andre is
lying on me here.

183
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,299
The store owner--
now why would he lie?

184
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,312
- Andre working a package out the store.
- Ah.

185
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,644
Folk like that, they tend to bear
a certain resentment

186
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,944
toward folk like me.

187
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,213
If you didn't do this,
when you did others--

188
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,621
shit, I got files
on two open doubles last year.

189
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,454
Shotgun shells
at both scenes.

190
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,792
- What about that stash-house gunfight?
- Hmm?

191
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,233
What about Stringer Bell
and his muscle dead in the warehouse?

192
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,705
If this one ain't on you,
another dozen probably are.

193
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,764
And if this one
goes to court,

194
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,003
you can tell that jury
how wrong it is.

195
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,311
Obviously, a guy's alone
before I swear to them on the stand.

196
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,518
You leave me at courtside
and I'm done.

197
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,078
- You know that.
- Yeah?

198
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,953
So you ain't
making friends.

199
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,652
I got a bounty
on my head, man--

200
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,319
five figures.

201
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,626
If I would have known I'd be
sharing quarters with all these boys,

202
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,001
I probably wouldn't
have robbed so many of them.

203
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,530
Aw yeah,
that golden rule.

204
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,841
Well, since you
feeling all Biblical

205
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,971
and righteous and all,
you think on this:

206
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,142
Now if Omar ain't killed
that delivery lady, somebody else did.

207
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:42,644
But you giving him a free walk
right now, though, ain't you?

208
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,623
A man got
to have a code.

209
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,510
What's up?

210
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,452
Just the dice.

211
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,819
Grab the dice
from any game that has them.

212
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,992
We're using
that third edition, right?

213
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,131
- I don't know.
- We're using the third.

214
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,142
What are the new
fifth editions doing

215
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,837
sitting down here in a box?

216
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,237
No way.

217
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,210
Big red, y'all.

218
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,075
Big reds over here.

219
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,418
What's up, man?

220
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,820
Got your big yellow.

221
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,121
What's up?

222
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,854
Big yellow for you.

223
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,153
Look at you,
all business and shit.

224
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,766
Big yellow bird.

225
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,996
Yo, who you bumping with?

226
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,665
Ain't no bump.

227
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,537
They got their corner,
I got mine.

228
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,804
Ain't no thing.

229
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,538
You going up
the gym today?

230
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,979
I might see you later.

231
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,143
Big yellow.
Big yellow birds over here.

232
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,211
- Well, maybe they with Marlo.
- Ain't with no one.

233
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,587
They're just young'uns
playing in this shit.

234
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,182
So what you want to do?

235
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,557
Don't want to mix here
and bring the police to our shop.

236
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,425
When they step off,
you follow.

237
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,261
- Bank 'em good.
- What if they strut?

238
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,767
Yellow, big yellow.

239
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,599
Ain't no need
to pop no one,

240
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,763
but they need a warning.

241
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,773
Make sure they know
we for real.

242
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,640
Brokeback, man.
Brokeback right here.

243
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,439
Fresh from the street.
Brokeback.

244
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,105
Brokeback.
Brokeback.

245
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,340
Big yellow bird.

246
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,179
Tried to bring out
who was on me.

247
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,277
Led him
to the train station.

248
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,414
How that work?

249
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,949
Had the railroad police on me.

250
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,953
Couldn't smoke.
Guy was pulling the strings.

251
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,989
You need a name.

252
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:45,493
You get that,
I can run it down for you.

253
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,733
I'll get a name.

254
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,469
Camera still there?

255
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,304
Steal that motherfucker.

256
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,314
No one speaks to it,

257
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,145
then it's the feds
sniffing you out.

258
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,947
It's only federals who'd be
rich enough to lose a camera

259
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,749
and not go
to crying about it.

260
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,985
You steal that bitch
and someone comes knocking,

261
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,255
it's local.

262
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,255
Steal that bitch.

263
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,287
See what comes.

264
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,960
Hey, you know the boy used to be
with me running these carts,

265
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,631
go by the name
of Sherrod?

266
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,232
I'm looking for him.
I've got some good news.

267
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,835
So if you spot him,
you know, tell him to come see me.

268
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,780
That's $9 for two,
$10 for three.

269
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,680
That's $10 even too.
That's a good product.

270
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,150
Ain't none
of that alley shit.

271
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,847
People walking in front
of the camera waving-- waving hello.

272
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,412
Them Chinese made that shit.

273
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,788
- Yeah.
- No?

274
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,816
Hey, bro.
Much obliged.

275
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,623
It's a good deal,
good deal.

276
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,857
Hey, remember
to holler at my boy if you see him.

277
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,297
All right.

278
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,630
All right, here we go!

279
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,637
Bubbles' Depot
for my people.

280
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,536
Bubbles'll take care
of your troubles.

281
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,835
Ain't no trouble yet.

282
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,508
All right.
All right.

283
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,671
Take it easy, okay?

284
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,976
I know you remember me.

285
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,607
All right,
be cool with it.

286
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,345
Give it up, nigga--

287
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,376
that's what I'm gonna say to you
every time we meet.

288
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,650
Money or pills,
don't care which.

289
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,251
All right,
all right. Cool.

290
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,783
I'm getting it.

291
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,454
See?

292
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,967
Back down, yo.
He's in a hole.

293
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,781
Motherfucker
bad for business, man.

294
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,343
Y'all don't take care of
your neighborhood store?

295
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,652
What's up?

296
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,797
Officer.

297
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,326
How you doing, Officer?

298
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,633
Can you help me out please?

299
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,832
I just got robbed.

300
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,206
Thank you, man.
They all saw it.

301
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,404
Everybody was here
witnessing everything.

302
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,569
Took your money?

303
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,344
Yeah, man.
Same guy every day.

304
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,647
He went down the alley
towards Payson Street.

305
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,380
You can cut him off
on Lafayette--

306
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,912
You can't sell on the street
without a license.

307
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,518
And these movies--
it's copyright infringement.

308
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,621
- Come on, man.
- That's a hefty fine.

309
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,294
That's my 10--

310
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,598
Are you gonna rob me too?

311
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,269
That's what
you're gonna do?

312
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,834
You rob me also?

313
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,608
Baltimore's finest right here.
Thank you.

314
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,651
Everybody gather up,

315
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,956
all right?

316
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,827
Everybody take five
and gather up.

317
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,436
Mike, get in here too.

318
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,504
I want everybody that uses
the gym to hear this now.

319
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,287
Most of y'all know I came home

320
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,222
after being in a long time.

321
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,691
And some of y'all-- shit,

322
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,354
all of y'all probably
seen me welcoming the attentions

323
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,989
of some of the ladies
who've come past.

324
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,830
Easy.

325
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:41,828
Now, I realize that some
of these ladies is your relations.

326
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,841
I ain't mean
to disrespect y'all

327
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,810
or have any feelings hurt.

328
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,610
All y'all come in here
to learn a sport

329
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,583
and better yourselves.

330
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,815
Ain't no need for me
to get in the way of that.

331
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,718
All right.

332
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,691
And if your witness is in the game,
and Omar jacked him up good--

333
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,794
- What the fuck is this?
- Hey, Crutch, I'm just asking.

334
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,304
Is he kin
to you or what?

335
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,499
Vernon, man, you ran the sheet
on that Old Face, right?

336
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,337
Yeah. He was an asshole.
So what?

337
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,003
So what?
What's the history?

338
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,478
Do we come behind your casework
talking this kind of shit?

339
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,639
- Aw.
- Do we?

340
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,615
- Come on.
- No. Fuck you, Bunk.

341
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,448
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

342
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,995
Soon as he comes out the gym,
yo, bank his ass, man.

343
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,527
Make sure
that nigga's shook.

344
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,169
You thought
I wouldn't handle it.

345
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,678
Some of us are in need
of some reproof.

346
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,681
I don't know about
all this beefin', man.

347
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,205
What, you scared, nigga?

348
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,478
We need to pump
your ass up some more.

349
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,828
Game on.

350
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,141
You coming round
the way tomorrow?

351
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,147
I think you should
stay off that spot.

352
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,773
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

353
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,477
Man, fuck you.

354
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,950
Fuck!

355
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,120
Mouthing don't
work for you, nigga.

356
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,593
Whoa whoa whoa.

357
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,688
Y'all have got to take this shit
out of the front of my door.

358
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,195
Namond, go inside.

359
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,501
Man, fuck you!

360
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,007
Yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah.

361
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,304
Hey, I feel you, man.

362
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,640
Ain't no beef here, though,

363
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,202
all right?

364
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,647
Go inside, man.

365
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,087
Yo, what happened
to your boy?

366
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,287
What the fuck
happened to you?

367
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,454
Ain't nothing.

368
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,293
You need to see how
the other nigga look.

369
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,593
- Who was that?
- Ain't nothing.

370
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,122
I can handle that fool.

371
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,135
- You ain't have to step too.
- Aw shit, no!

372
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,763
You had everything under control.
Look at your face!

373
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,638
Course, I recognize the other boy
was high as all hell.

374
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,142
And anything can jump off
when it's like that, you know.

375
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,509
Yeah, and he'd have been
on his ass if you ain't mixed in.

376
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,682
What's going on?

377
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,816
He into something?

378
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,291
Ain't none of my business.

379
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,191
Yours either.

380
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,764
Seriously, you guys ran
a hell of a campaign--

381
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,170
no let-up,
a lot of heart.

382
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,367
- I'll second that.
- Yeah. I liked the shit

383
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,968
when you trotted out
that witness story during the debate.

384
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,808
What about the fucking
last-minute fliers

385
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,438
and me and the slum lord
doing a tango

386
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,743
on the courthouse steps?

387
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,113
Wait.

388
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,277
Parker, who was behind that?

389
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,617
I didn't see
no Royce authority line.

390
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,213
Well?

391
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,421
Tommy, enough of
the bullshit, hmm?

392
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,228
What the hell
are we waiting for?

393
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,497
Bring your ass around here
and try out the big chair.

394
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,664
Come on.
Come on around here.

395
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,230
I'm not even Mayor-Elect.

396
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,299
General election's still
a few weeks away.

397
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,107
You don't beat Crawford
in a city where we outnumber

398
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,343
Republicans nine to one,
you don't deserve the fucking job.

399
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,974
Now, get on around here.

400
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,745
If I lose the general election,

401
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,347
I'll just blame Norman here.

402
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,858
He's taking over
from Terri D'Agostino.

403
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,258
She did good for you.

404
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,194
Yeah, she did.
The national noticed.

405
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,199
She's back at D.C.C.C. Iooking
to target red-state delegations.

406
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,326
After what she pulled off,
I hope she got a win bonus.

407
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,064
Hell, yeah.
They gave her my share too.

408
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,571
Wouldn't you know it?

409
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,201
Tommy, whatever you need
going forward

410
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,507
for the general election,
for the transition--

411
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,308
I want to hit
the ground running,

412
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,212
so I'm gonna need
to learn the agencies,

413
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,547
the budgets,
the problems-- all of it.

414
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,609
Wherever you want to go,
whatever you want to look at.

415
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,416
- See to it.
- Mm-hmm.

416
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,320
It's a hell
of a goddamn job.

417
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,383
Halfway glad to get out.

418
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,519
I'm gonna miss it.

419
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,141
Braddock case
running you in circles?

420
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,242
Whole day was
a waste of time.

421
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,652
Why not talk
to Wardell himself?

422
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,087
Ask him if he killed
the witness against him.

423
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,621
If he read the newspapers,
he already knows he's a suspect.

424
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,693
Will he take a polygraph?
Call his lawyer.

425
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,103
Tell him they're about to shift the
narcotics case over to the federal court

426
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,665
because a state witness
was murdered.

427
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,836
Tell him if his client
doesn't cooperate,

428
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,813
he's looking at mandatory minimums
and no parole.

429
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,441
The feds don't want
drug cases anymore,

430
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,919
especially not a case that's gonna
fall apart without a key witness.

431
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,390
Bluff. What have you
got to lose?

432
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,915
Maybe he blows the box.
Maybe he passes.

433
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,088
But he talks a bit
either way,

434
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,792
and you, Detective,
get to listen.

435
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,732
The fuck am l
looking at here?

436
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,808
Birds... I think.

437
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,504
You see that there?
I think that's a wing flapping.

438
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,622
Shit. Fuck!

439
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,463
Fuck it anyway, man!

440
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,504
Mr. Bond?

441
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,944
Hey. Call me Rupert.

442
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,447
Thanks for coming over.

443
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,972
Try to get
a running start,

444
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,450
meeting with
my unit chiefs.

445
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,214
No problem.

446
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,289
Congratulations
on the election result.

447
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,382
You'll be coming in
with quite a mandate.

448
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,949
Maybe so.

449
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,095
So, how can I help you
with the transition?

450
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,828
There's not a lot of high-end
narcotics cases in the pipeline,

451
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,632
- and major crimes--
- We'll cut it for political reasons.

452
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,639
Once the polls put me
up there with Demper,

453
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,073
people started
whispering in my ear.

454
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,441
And I also heard
about your subpoenas--

455
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,537
Andy Krawczyk,
Clay Davis.

456
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,275
Sir, I didn't intend--

457
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,840
To go after a couple
of Royce's money men four weeks

458
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,910
before a primary election?

459
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,478
Yeah. I think you're
wasted in narcotics.

460
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,416
Let me guess--

461
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,329
- How about V.C.U. as Unit Chief?
- What?

462
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,299
Violent Crimes Unit.

463
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,960
How about you
take that over for me?

464
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,438
Carcetti ran on a platform
of dropping the murder rate,

465
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,498
so V.C.U. is where the sparks
are gonna fly, right?

466
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,342
You're putting me in charge
of all homicide prosecutions?

467
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,548
What about llene Nathan?

468
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,347
She's moving up
to Second Deputy.

469
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,455
I came in here ready to get bounced
down to misdemeanors or worse.

470
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,485
Why would you think that?

471
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,692
The subpoenas
and the fact that Demper--

472
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,564
Demper lost the election.

473
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,432
I won.

474
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,906
And I admire your courage,
if not your loyalty.

475
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,272
Lester.

476
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,606
Excuse me?

477
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,305
Forgive me.

478
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,110
V.C.U. is great.

479
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,209
I'm more than ready to work
murders for you, Mr. Bond.

480
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,743
Good.

481
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,052
Rupert.

482
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,751
But now she's told police

483
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,489
sex was consentual
on Paul and Monnel only. So...

484
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,327
- So, Randy--
- He'll be back tomorrow.

485
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,266
- And the thing with the police?
- It's out of my hands.

486
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,098
Turn it down, ladies.

487
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,304
Quanice, lose the gum.

488
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,305
Okay. Settle down.

489
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,938
Mr. Prezbo!

490
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,573
What's he doing
with a computer?

491
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,278
We're gonna have a computer
in the class for special projects,

492
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,115
and another thing--

493
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,952
Dang!
They all new and shit.

494
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,582
Leave the old ones
on your desks,

495
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,923
and put your names
on the box

496
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,224
on the inside cover
of the new ones.

497
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:01,664
Okay. Did anyone have any trouble
with the homework?

498
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,190
- Charlene?
- I didn't get it.

499
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,533
- Didn't get what?
- None of it.

500
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,002
Michael?

501
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,314
That's great.
Good job.

502
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,216
Come on, eh?

503
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,817
Calvin, is this your work?

504
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,655
'Cause it looks
like someone else's.

505
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,160
No, I did my work.

506
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,220
Okay. Next time,
try to remember

507
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,527
not to copy Quanice's
name at the top.

508
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,559
All right. Did everybody
get a new textbook?

509
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,797
Yes.

510
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,170
Great. Okay.

511
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,005
Well, for now at least,
you can get those out of sight.

512
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,375
- Whoa!
- That's right!

513
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,142
Namond, why aren't
you in uniform?

514
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,414
Why did you decide
not to wear it?

515
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,910
I ain't in my right class,
so ain't no need for a uniform.

516
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,685
Interesting.

517
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,318
Why you always write down
everything we say?

518
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,351
Trying to get
inside our heads or something?

519
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,192
You trying
to get into mine?

520
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:10,190
Chandra, do you think this is
a beauty salon or a classroom?

521
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,533
Darnell, why didn't
you wear your uniform?

522
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,474
I meant to. I did.

523
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,204
Yeah, but after
a quart of vodka,

524
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,042
it'd be hard to know
what color shirt

525
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,945
you're supposed
to be wearing.

526
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,745
And you find
that funny, Namond?

527
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,581
Man, fuck you.

528
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,521
Darnell has a drinking problem,
and Namond, we believe,

529
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,319
suffers from
conduct-disorder issues.

530
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,723
- Do you need a time-out?
- Fuck you.

531
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,158
Yeah, he's got
a mouth on him.

532
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,662
Chandra, is it necessary
to comb your hair in class?

533
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,687
Fuck you,
cheese-faced bitch!

534
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,292
- I should tell you--
- You ain't tellin' nobody nothing!

535
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,892
Yeah. You know,
I was wondering

536
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,563
why she was in the class.
She seemed so--

537
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,662
Chandra, listen to me.

538
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,332
Oppositional defiant personality.

539
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,898
Get the fuck out
of my face, bitch!

540
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,671
I'm sorry
you're having a bad day,

541
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,838
but you're gonna have to
take a little walk with Miss Mason.

542
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,678
Come back when you've
pulled it all back together again.

543
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,446
Damn. It's bye-bye time
for my girl Chandra.

544
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,614
Yeah, you think?

545
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:08,717
Then to reiterate, this is
a polygraph examination--

546
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,456
non-admissible,
and the answers to all questions

547
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,464
are regarded as a proffer

548
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,296
- with a limited grant of immunity.
- Agreed.

549
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,064
Okay. To begin, please answer yes
to a series of questions

550
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,765
regardless of whether or not
that answer is correct.

551
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,502
Is your name
Anthony Wardell?

552
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,804
Yeah.

553
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,674
And you're from
Baltimore, Maryland?

554
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,203
Right now I'm over at City Jail,
but I'm from East Side.

555
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,340
So your answer is?

556
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,974
Yeah, I'm from Baltimore.

557
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,279
Are you female?

558
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,187
Fuck is wrong with--
my bad.

559
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,349
Yeah, I'm a bitch.

560
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,288
- Hey, sweet thing.
- Chandra.

561
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,695
We're working
on our short essay.

562
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,896
If you--

563
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,132
Diamonds are
a girl's best friend.

564
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,834
Need to get down
to lay down.

565
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,171
Namond, if you don't stop,

566
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,177
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave class.

567
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,941
See you sad-ass motherfuckers
in about three days--

568
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,778
You're leaving class,
not school.

569
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,283
What?

570
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,713
What about now,
bitch? Huh?

571
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,451
Huh?

572
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,356
That's not necessary,
Namond.

573
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,826
Oh, you gonna
suspend me?

574
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,295
We're gonna have
a little talk.

575
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,958
Man, fuck y'all.
I know the rules.

576
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,833
You've got to suspend me.
School's got to have rules.

577
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,769
He's right.
You've got to have rules.

578
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,066
Can't just be throwing
that shit out.

579
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,040
The point is:
I can call it like you want.

580
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,042
You want him to pass?
He passed.

581
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,840
You want him to come up inconclusive,
he's inconclusive.

582
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,109
What the fuck
kind of science is that?

583
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,979
Come on.
Did he blow the box or not?

584
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,507
I'm here for you,
Detective.

585
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,882
You know what we use
the polygraph for?

586
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,946
Leverage.

587
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,754
To get him in here
and fuck with him.

588
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,587
No wonder
this shit's inadmissible.

589
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,337
Let me guess.

590
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,863
They're out in the hall
and Swatowski is telling them

591
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,671
that he can make it go
any way they want.

592
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,201
If you think that's how we play it,
then why let your client--

593
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,305
Because you know
there's not much case left

594
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,748
now that
your witness is dead.

595
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,947
I don't need to expose him
to a federal charge if I can avoid it.

596
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:20,617
And because even if
Swatowski bends it for our ears,

597
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:25,118
he's let you know that
Mr. Wardell here did not blow the box.

598
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,790
Yo, I wouldn't kill me.

599
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,561
Even if it flips on me,
I ain't gonna do shit to the man.

600
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,931
Why not?

601
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,129
My moms and his--
they're, like, cousins.

602
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,401
Came up together
in the Latrobe, you know?

603
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,637
I've been knowing him since,
like, Head Start and shit.

604
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,473
But he was gonna testify.

605
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,639
What am I looking at on the first
conviction on this kind of waive?

606
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,707
Seven, eight?
Shit, I'll be out in three and a half.

607
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,812
You think I'm gonna kill my mom's
cousin's boy for three and a half?

608
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,880
I know that man helped
get himself elected

609
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,018
claiming that
I did me like that, but please.

610
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,059
Bum-ass motherfucker was
gonna testify against me,

611
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,797
and I swear to God
I feel bad he's dead.

612
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,305
I do.

613
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,673
Hey, llene,
I've been looking all over for you.

614
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,944
Omar Little.

615
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,109
From Bird's trial
a couple of years ago.

616
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,778
- The stickup boy.
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,947
He's in City Jail
on a felony murder.

618
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,616
Store robbery,
West Side.

619
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,854
When I gave him the card, I told him
it was for a light felony at best.

620
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:33,853
Yeah, of course,
but he needs to get writ out of B.C.D.C.

621
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,594
and put in protective
custody somewhere else.

622
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,000
He's sharing his address
with about 800 other guys

623
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,129
who have seen the business end
of his shotgun.

624
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,073
- Why do you care?
- I'm pretty sure he's being set up.

625
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,509
Really? How does that play with
the rest of the guys in the squad room?

626
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,240
Look, all I'm asking
is that you move him

627
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,248
to some county detention center

628
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,046
at least until I have a chance
to work back up on this thing.

629
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,248
Now, this card
ought to buy him that much.

630
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,085
Is Hartford County
Detention Center quiet enough?

631
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,891
- Yeah.
- Go pick up a writ in my office

632
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,889
and tell Mr. Little my debt's paid.

633
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:14,064
The fact is that homicides are
off 14% in the West Side this year.

634
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,801
But I'm not gonna stand here
and take credit for that

635
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,832
when all other U.C.R.
felonies are up.

636
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,401
- Why not, Major?
- A wise man once told me years ago

637
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,969
when I wasn't
even a sergeant

638
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,949
that you should never take credit
when the crime rate drops

639
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,383
unless you want
to take the blame when it rises.

640
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,382
Atten-hut.
Mayor-Elect is on deck.

641
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,188
Please, back to what
you're doing.

642
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,127
I'm just a councilman
here to observe.

643
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,527
At ease, gentlemen.

644
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:43,022
Major Daniels,
continue your presentation.

645
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:46,093
In any event, rather than allow
my post cars to patrol,

646
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,934
I put two-man cars

647
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,202
in the post
with the worst drug corners:

648
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:54,974
Edmonson Avenue, Poplar Grove,
Fayette and Baltimore Streets,

649
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,310
North Avenue.

650
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:01,808
Now, if nothing else,
a two-man car is more aggressive,

651
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,946
and that helps push it away
from the most volatile corners,

652
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,890
- which may be having an effect.
- Just pushing it?

653
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,517
I'm not devoting my resources

654
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,460
to cheap street arrests,
Commissioner.

655
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,793
Instead, I'm trying
to bring every officer I can

656
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,459
to bear on making
quality felony cases.

657
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,434
I could do more
but, well, it's my opinion

658
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,370
that not enough of the troops
I have are sufficiently trained

659
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,737
to properly
investigate such cases.

660
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,641
Major, you just
insulted your command.

661
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,545
Respectfully, sir, too many
of my people have spent years

662
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,812
chasing street-level arrests
while they grab bodies and make stats.

663
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,479
But that doesn't teach you
how to write a proper warrant

664
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,579
or testify properly
as to probable cause

665
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,023
or use, and not get used
by an informant.

666
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,787
I wish it were otherwise.

667
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,852
But if I'm chasing
felony cases,

668
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,295
I can only bring a minority
of my officers to bear.

669
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,629
- You've got all of it already!
- That's right.

670
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,862
Make a nigga work.
You like that shit.

671
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,893
Ain't that right, motherfucker?

672
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,805
You can't hide, son.

673
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,968
Don't care where it is.

674
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,945
In a nigga's ass crack,
I'll still find you.

675
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,518
Damn. Fucked that man up.

676
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,028
- Yeah, boy.
- All right.

677
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,293
So we starting
a little later than I wanted.

678
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,301
Yo, but you said you was gonna
creep out of school after lunch.

679
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,962
I tried.
They won't put me out.

680
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,733
Shit. Ain't no school
gonna hold me if I want to go.

681
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,604
It's this new class
they put me in.

682
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,168
It's so fucked up,
yo, they working all backwards and shit.

683
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,735
All right,
let's get to this:

684
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,771
Yo, Bobby,
you working the stash.

685
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,942
Yo yo, why aren't
where we was yesterday?

686
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,145
- The spot was right.
- This is good here?

687
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,519
What the fuck is wrong with you?
He was on this strip yesterday.

688
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,649
This ain't shit.

689
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,490
Yo, if you don't want to sell
my shit, then fuck you, Kenard.

690
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,189
I keep my money.

691
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,129
This spot is just
as good as the other.

692
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,655
Shit...

693
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,136
Carv, do you know how much
that video camera costs?

694
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,233
$4,200, which makes
our adventure with Fuzzy Dunlop

695
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,210
Iook like a fucking
walk in the park.

696
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,212
To get the camera
from l.S.D.,

697
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,147
I had to get authorization
from your supervisor, right?

698
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,917
Still, you lost it
doing police work.

699
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,420
Your lieutenant
will understand.

700
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,583
Marimow? You know what
that asshole understands?

701
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,320
Burning motherfuckers
for petty shit like this.

702
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,659
- Help me, Carv.
- This is not my problem.

703
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,392
Don't fuck me, Carv.
Don't fuck me now.

704
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,730
You know what this is?

705
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,066
This is one of those
enabling relationships.

706
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,537
Enable me, Carv.

707
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:38,531
Enable me to find
my fuckin' camera.

708
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,975
You're seeing pigeons?

709
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,276
Last night we did.

710
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,783
Me and Sydnor ran
the Westside

711
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,081
Iooking at every pigeon
coop we could find.

712
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,112
This morning,
nothing in the monitor.

713
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,852
- Did you check the pawnshops?
- Every one.

714
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,520
I fucking know this asshole Marlo
has my camera.

715
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,552
- Aw, fuck me.
- What?

716
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,064
You just reminded me.

717
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,498
I had to brief this kid
last week who said he knew

718
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,968
something about a murder
that Marlo's people did.

719
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,631
- I meant to call Bunk on it.
- Bunk caught the case?

720
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,971
No. Actually, he had a warrant for
the guy who supposedly got killed.

721
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,477
I rode around with him
on it a while back.

722
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,309
What about me?

723
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,315
I got problems here, man.

724
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,045
The only thing
you can do

725
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,883
is get some wood
on Marlo Stanfield or his people.

726
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,617
Scare him enough
to send the camera back.

727
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,215
What do you
have on Marlo?

728
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,988
I know he's a drug dealer.

729
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,892
I can't prove it
or nothing, but I know.

730
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,160
Detective Pitts,
pick up 2594. Pitts...

731
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,860
Okay, listen.

732
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,994
How about I let you
debrief the kid first?

733
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,436
- See what he can give you.
- This gets the camera home?

734
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,064
Maybe not,
but you talk to the runt,

735
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,075
and maybe he gives you
some shit on Marlo.

736
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,804
Maybe even gives you
a murder or two.

737
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,072
Before you call
Homicide on it,

738
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,340
you walk it
back to Marimow

739
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,940
Iike the cat
with the mouse in its teeth.

740
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,314
You bring him the murder,
he probably forgives the camera.

741
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,842
Lumen, line 5.

742
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,650
Lumen, pick up
the fucking phone.

743
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,787
Looking for
Detective Moreland.

744
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,162
Could you have him call Sergeant Carver
at the Western, please?

745
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,895
Carver? Western?

746
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,768
Hmm. Got it.

747
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,209
Fuck that Bunk.

748
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,813
- Thoughts on your cabinet?
- Lots of them.

749
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,619
But top of the list,
Ervin Burrell's ass is gone.

750
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,888
I told Royce to dump him
more than a year ago,

751
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,125
but Clarence didn't want to piss off
the ministers until after the primary.

752
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,099
Primary's over.
He can do it now.

753
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,294
You think Clarence Royce
is gonna do you that favor?

754
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,395
He's already thinking about
taking a poke at Elijah

755
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,134
and running for the Seventh District
congressional seat.

756
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,507
He's gonna need every black minister
in town to lay hands upon him.

757
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,671
- Fine. I'll do it myself.
- No, you won't.

758
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,908
Royce can fire
a black police commissioner,

759
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,246
but the newly-elected
white mayor cannot.

760
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,343
Same brothers who voted
for you'll be at your throat.

761
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,355
What if I got a black commissioner
to replace the son of a bitch?

762
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,688
Under Burrell, the only black deputy
is Cawthorne, and he's 70.

763
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,286
After that, it's just
majors and lieutenants.

764
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,819
We go outside--
nationwide search.

765
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,354
Deputy chiefs
in New York or L.A.

766
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,526
make more than
their police commissioner.

767
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,731
If you're talented and black,
why would you be in Baltimore?

768
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,365
I have often asked myself
that very question

769
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,136
on a number of occasions.

770
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,369
So I'm stuck
with Burrell. Fuck.

771
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,042
Have a seat.

772
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:39,021
Don't keep him late.
He's got to be at school in the morning.

773
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,751
I thought you said
he was suspended.

774
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,383
They're letting me
back in tomorrow.

775
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,223
Miss Anna'd want me
to be home by 9:00.

776
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,558
Don't forget to send him

777
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,756
on to Bunk
after you're done.

778
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,061
Look after him.
He's a good kid.

779
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,931
You hungry?

780
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,270
Yeah.

781
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,969
Let's eat.

782
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,780
Hey, kid, let me ask you
right off the bat:

783
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:09,445
You know what a police
surveillance camera looks like?

784
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,649
Councilman, you sure you don't want
to ride with Lieutenant Grace?

785
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,214
I mean, she'll be
in command of the ship.

786
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,453
What's the point
of a ride-along with the bosses?

787
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,290
I need to see what
the troops see, right?

788
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,489
Fine. I love
the idea of a mayor

789
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,929
who knows what
we're up against.

790
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,694
Officers McFarley
and Ginter,

791
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,291
this is the mayor-elect,

792
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,132
and he'll be riding
with you in sector three.

793
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,797
- How you doing?
- Hey.

794
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,238
Don't let him get captured.

795
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,868
Obviously, I didn't know nothing
about it in the beginning.

796
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,935
Little Kevin--
he just told me to tell Lex

797
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,947
to go up to the playground
behind Fulton

798
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,915
'cause his girl was up there.

799
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,782
- And Lex got killed?
- Yeah.

800
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,252
Where'd he get killed?

801
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,552
So you actually weren't there
to see him killed?

802
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,080
I told you.

803
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,457
Little Kevin-- he just told me
to tell Lex to go up

804
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,792
to the playground and see
this girl Patrice.

805
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,730
Then later, Kevin come up
to me and tell me

806
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,494
Chris and Snoop
killed the dude.

807
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,127
- What's Kevin's last name?
- I don't know.

808
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,967
- You don't have his name?
- Little Kevin is all I know.

809
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,371
So let me
get this straight:

810
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,102
You told the guy
to go somewhere,

811
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,370
and then you heard
he was killed,

812
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,037
but you don't know
where he was killed,

813
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,205
and you don't even know
if anyone ever found the body?

814
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,613
- How do you know Lex is really dead?
- Everybody know it.

815
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,118
- Who is everybody?
- Everybody from around the way.

816
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,517
Yo, listen.

817
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,113
People be saying that Chris
and Snoop be turning niggas

818
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,681
into zombies for Marlo,
but I know that ain't true.

819
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,454
When you dead,
you dead is all.

820
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,052
Zombies, huh?

821
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,656
You know what this is?
This is bullshit.

822
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,963
- You're bullshitting me.
- No, sir.

823
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,902
You were right there when this
Lex fellow got dropped, weren't you?

824
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,666
- No.
- Yes, you were.

825
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,140
You're an eyeball witness
who can get me Snoop and Chris both.

826
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,608
- I told you--
- Look, kid.

827
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,167
If you were there,
you can say so.

828
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,838
We can do a lot for you,

829
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,973
maybe help you out with this problem
you got at the school.

830
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,142
I ain't got a problem no more.
I'm good with that.

831
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,651
- You were there, right?
- Herc.

832
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,620
Just say you were there!

833
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,485
So how do you like
being mayor so far?

834
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,616
I've still got to win
the general election

835
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,558
and the inauguration's
not till December.

836
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,652
So what do I know?

837
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,357
Well, you can't do
any worse than Royce.

838
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,762
City's going to shit.

839
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:06,099
Yeah. Well, what do
you guys suggest I do first?

840
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:10,402
An air strike.
White phosphorus.

841
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,739
Drop that shit on everything
between here and North Avenue.

842
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,506
Seriously.
That shit works.

843
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,104
My brother's a marine, right?

844
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,876
They use W.P. over
there in Fallujah.

845
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,817
Signal 13, shots fired.
200 North Calhoun.

846
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,319
Bang.
There it is.

847
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:26,652
Now you're gonna see some shit,
Mr. Mayor. Pardon my French.

848
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,352
You know
what's fucked up?

849
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,796
No one hears the gunshot.

850
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:39,201
On the canvas, no one
even claims to hear the shot.

851
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,101
So look,
our next move is

852
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,163
to work back on
Wardell's visiting list.

853
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,336
If the sergeant asks,
I'm on the street.

854
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,984
Fuck, is that 13
on Calhoun Street?

855
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,957
I don't know, but they 1032'd
10 minutes ago, sir.

856
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,153
You're not dropping me off
at my crib, are you?

857
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,162
I mean, you can
leave me, like,

858
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,823
a block or two
up from here.

859
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,298
I could walk
the rest of the way.

860
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,528
Don't want to be seen
with the police, huh?

861
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,559
Yeah.

862
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,196
All right, boss.

863
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,536
I'll pull over right here.

864
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,177
What the fuck was
Carv thinking?

865
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,085
This kid can't
give me a murder.

866
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,613
We go right at Marlo.

867
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:39,493
Fuck the backdoor when we can
go in the front, you know?

868
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,521
Next I want a detective
at University

869
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,965
in case the guy that comes out
makes any kind of declaration.

870
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,832
Right, and have someone
in the room with him.

871
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,303
Officer Leach is being transported
down to you by a sergeant.

872
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,135
Service weapon's
with Detective Hollister,

873
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,368
on their way
to Ballistics.

874
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:53,968
No. No, looks like
a clean shoot.

875
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,979
I've got spent shells
from two suspect weapons,

876
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,810
different calibers,
both recovered.

877
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,475
Right.
Yeah, I know.

878
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,417
No, I'm not out here
at the scene.

879
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,910
But call the P.I.O. and have him issue
a statement from downtown.

880
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,117
Tell the S.A.O. that if they want
to have someone out here

881
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,558
survey the scene, they need
to move now 'cause Crime Lab

882
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,789
is finishing up,
and the O.C.M.E. van is here waiting.

883
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,661
Yeah....

884
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,928
isn't that the Western
District commander?

885
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,298
Yeah, that's Daniels.

886
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,893
He's the duty officer tonight.

887
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,098
Seems to know
his business.

888
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,130
He ain't as bad
as some.

889
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,120
Police.

890
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,270
Baltimore Police.

891
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,867
Okay. There's still 85 eligible

892
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,970
from September
who need an October day.

893
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,481
That'll work, ma'am.

894
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,415
I'm counting on you
fellows to get it done

895
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,781
before the end
of the month.

896
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,479
I can keep you
on salary till then.

897
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,456
You know what?
This ain't for me.

898
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,085
Look. I thank you
for the opportunity, ma'am,

899
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,927
but it ain't so much
just to bring a man for a day or two.

900
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,991
I mean, if you had something

901
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,094
where I was working
with these kids...

902
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,033
Anyway, thanks again.

903
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,676
- David.
- Hey.

904
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,279
Thought you was
at lda Wells.

905
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,313
Language arts position
opened up here,

906
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,849
so I came over last year.

907
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,193
- Hey. What's up, Coach?
- Hey.

908
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,028
You come over for some of
your boys today? Some kind of program?

909
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,127
Nah. Something else.
Didn't work out really.

910
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,001
Be well.

911
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,650
You mind
if I give him a go?

912
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,519
- Sure.
- Fuck you!

913
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,354
Okay.

914
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,699
But you're still
in this room.

915
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,291
Fuck you!

916
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,505
You know you're not going back with
the others till you learn to behave.

917
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,478
- Fuck you.
- Until you show you can handle it,

918
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,811
you're not going back
to your regular class.

919
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,373
Fuck you.

920
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,282
Look. And you damn sure
ain't going home

921
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,184
'cause there ain't no more
getting suspended.

922
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,259
Mr. Colvin, sir?

923
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,562
Fuck you.

924
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,799
'Cause I ain't feel like it.
That's why.

925
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,930
This is bullshit.
I ain't reading

926
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,406
no motherfucking book either!

927
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,341
I don't even know nothing
about the damn book.

928
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,812
And you always getting on my ass
and shit about some book.

929
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,644
Fuck you,
you cheese-faced bitch!

930
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,810
Albert, Albert,
settle down now.

931
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,412
This gonna be harder
than we thought, man.

932
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:39,854
It's fascinating, isn't it?

933
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,289
All right. Class...

934
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,848
This ain't no different
than the other class...

935
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,952
Clinically speaking.

936
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,424
Yo, your point's full.

937
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,230
I'm hot.
Come and get it.

938
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,169
All right.
I'll cover that.

939
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,672
- Me too.
- I'm betting with my boy Randy.

940
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,071
You about to get
your money taken.

941
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,700
Come on.

942
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,439
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

943
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,106
Pay up, sucker.

944
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:07,014
Randy, what are you doing?
Didn't we go over this?

945
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,608
How many ways
can you make a four?

946
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,347
Not enough
for his black ass.

947
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,787
Look who's talking.

948
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,119
Yo, he just come today,

949
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:16,284
so he missed
the whole thing about the odds.

950
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,987
Right.

951
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,393
Randy,

952
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:22,091
there's only three ways
to make a four,

953
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,498
- but to make a seven--
- Six.

954
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,900
That's good. So what should
have been your play?

955
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,633
Should have bet
against her roll.

956
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,471
Good to have you back,
Mr. Wagstaff.

957
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,306
Come on,
roll 'em, man.

958
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,471
I got 40.
I got 40 on it.

959
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:53,018
Trick them into thinking
they aren't learning, and they do.

960
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,400
Been looking
all over for you.

961
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,104
You found me.

962
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,442
Look, I been thinking,
Sherrod...

963
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,111
we're going about
our thing all wrong.

964
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,120
You know, look,
I made the mistake.

965
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,816
I was thinking I knew you better
than you knew yourself.

966
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,628
This corner-- this corner
mess will bring you down fast.

967
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:33,295
You know. I think you need
to come home, right?

968
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,566
You come by tonight,
and we work this shit out together.

969
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,902
I been thinking
about it.

970
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,567
Why don't you just
step right now?

971
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,473
I don't get paid till 8:00.

972
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,340
8:00, huh?

973
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,120
You all right?

974
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,521
Just a little tired,
that's all.

975
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,959
So I'm gonna
see you tonight, right, Sherrod?

976
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,180
You want to help me
take his statement?

977
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,953
Braddock case is down.

978
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,483
Room two.

979
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,627
You veteran crimefighters
got a name for this here, right?

980
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,637
"Murder weapon"
or some shit like that?

981
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,506
No fucking way.

982
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,346
Slug from autopsy matches

983
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,818
two more I pulled from
that smoke hound's backyard,

984
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,151
block into the side alley
from where Braddock fell.

985
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,384
- Our guy's dead from a stray.
- Hmph.

986
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,882
He was shooting
at 40s and Clorox bottles blocks away,

987
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,055
using potatoes for a silencer.

988
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,725
Bite me.
That's ridiculous.

989
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,599
So our guy's dead
because a bullet misses a bleach bottle.

990
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,102
And this fuck Carcetti

991
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,264
gets to be the mayor
behind this stupidity.

992
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,705
I fucking love
this town.

993
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,470
I do.

994
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,302
Nice pull, Greggs.

995
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,975
What's up, guys?

996
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,484
Sherrod!
