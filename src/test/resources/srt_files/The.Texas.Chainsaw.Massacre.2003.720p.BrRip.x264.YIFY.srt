1
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,447
The film which you are
about to see

2
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,457
is an account
of the tragedy

3
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,426
which befell a group
of 5 youths.

4
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,522
It is all the more tragic
in that they were young,

5
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,897
but had they lived
very, very long lives,

6
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,993
they could not
have expected,

7
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,833
nor would they
have wished to see

8
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,967
as much of the mad and macabre
as they were to see that day.

9
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,241
For them, an idyllic summer
afternoon became a nightmare.

10
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:24,545
For 30 years,
the files collected dust

11
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,209
in the cold-cases
division

12
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,720
of the travis county
police department.

13
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,220
Over 1,300 pieces
of evidence

14
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,353
were collected
from the crime scene

15
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,364
at the hewitt residence.

16
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,332
Yet none of the evidence
was more compelling

17
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,400
than the classified
police footage

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,347
of the crime-scene
walk-through.

19
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,406
Test, test, test.

20
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,907
Ok, uh... this
is august 20, 1973.

21
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,819
The time is 3:47 p.m.

22
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,292
Our location is the hewitt
residence on route 17.

23
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,328
That's where
victim one was found.

24
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,830
We're gonna do
a walk-through,

25
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,333
and we're now
descending the stairs

26
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,335
into the furnace room.

27
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,836
Uh...

28
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,338
there's... over here.

29
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,840
There's scratch marks
along the wall.

30
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,333
There's some more over here,
right along here.

31
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,380
And... oh, there's something
over here. It seems like...

32
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:33,852
it looks like a clot of hair
and an embedded fingernail.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,856
All right, we're gonna go move
into the actual furnace room.

34
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,892
The events of that day

35
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,895
were to lead to one
of the most bizarre crimes

36
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,897
in the annals
of american history...

37
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,592
the texas
chainsaw massacre.

38
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,902
Hold on! Hold on!

39
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,905
Don't let go!
Not yet! Not yet!

40
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,930
Yeah! Now! Now!
Let go!

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,196
Big wheels keep on turning

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,061
would somebody please
make her stop singing?

43
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,362
Carry me home to see my kin

44
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,903
i think you got
a beautiful voice, baby.

45
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,962
Thank you.

46
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,905
Ha!

47
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,876
I miss alabamy once again

48
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,311
and i think
it's a sin, yes

49
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,508
can you believe...

50
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,815
we didn't even know
each other yesterday?

51
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,882
I know.
It's just amazing.

52
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,222
Mmm!

53
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,592
You know what's
even more amazing?

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,427
Hello?

55
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,830
Hello?

56
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,334
What are you, like at a pause
or half-time?

57
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,634
Ok, the fact that
33,000 americans each day

58
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,230
are infected with
a sexually-transmitted disease,

59
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,835
and two-thirds of them
are just about your age.

60
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,668
Ha ha!

61
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,939
Hey, morgan.

62
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,077
How are you the expert
on the dumbest shit?

63
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,711
Sweet home alabama

64
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:21,355
lord, i'm coming home to you

65
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,327
what are the odds
of you guys

66
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,832
passing through
el paso

67
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,834
just as i started
to hitch?

68
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,496
I mean, it's like...
synchronicity.

69
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,366
It's like i.s.d.

70
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,501
It's like this shit
does not just happen.

71
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,975
Oh, baby, they got to
play "free bird."

72
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,245
Oh, they have to.

73
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,513
We paid a fortune
for these tickets.

74
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,418
Yo, kemp, can you do something
about the a.c. Back here?

75
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,581
I'm melting.

76
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,186
No.

77
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,558
But if you or pepper
get too hot,

78
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,062
you could always
take your clothes off.

79
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,656
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,600
You are such a perv.

81
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,365
Don't listen
to him, pepper.

82
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,930
Why not?
I think he's funny.

83
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,410
She's only known you
for 19 hours.

84
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,775
I've lived with him
for 3 years,

85
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,279
and trust me,
he is not funny.

86
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,820
Morgan, hey,
let me see that.

87
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,384
Careful, man.

88
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,418
Thank you.
I think

89
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,452
i can manage,
college boy.

90
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,828
Here.

91
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,333
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm nauseous.

92
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,336
Montezuma's revenge.
I was like erin...

93
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,770
"don't drink the water
down there."

94
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,773
I didn't.

95
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,331
And she didn't
drink the tequila,

96
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,842
she didn't drink
the weed...

97
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,605
smoke the weed.

98
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,879
Well, maybe i
didn't go to mexico

99
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,213
to watch you get
shit-faced for 4 days.

100
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,309
That is what people do
when they go to mexico.

101
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,853
What did you expect?

102
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,889
I don't know.

103
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,324
A tear-cut diamond ring
that goes right here

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,225
on my beautiful
little finger?

105
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,354
You're gonna get
your ring someday.

106
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,297
I heard
that one before.

107
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,493
Peace offering.

108
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,741
Oops. Oh...

109
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,905
that was
so not cool.

110
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,949
Guys, relax.
It's not like

111
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,007
we don't have
2 pounds of...

112
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,677
oh, right.
Shh!

113
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,778
What did you say?

114
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,322
I don't remember.
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,789
I got bad brain cells.

116
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,223
Uh, "2 pounds of pot."

117
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,817
Does that refresh
your memory?

118
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,987
Don't listen
to him.

119
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,155
He's baked,
and he's stupid.

120
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,664
Baby, will you
please tell me

121
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,065
that we did not go
to mexico to buy pot?

122
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,559
We did not go
to mexico to buy pot.

123
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,699
Hey, come on, baby.

124
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,700
Look at me. I am not
a dope smuggler, ok?

125
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,009
Tell me how much
you love me.

126
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,139
How much?
That much.

127
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,409
This much.
That much?

128
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,111
That's it.
That's it.

129
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,016
Ok.
Give me a kiss.

130
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,618
Can you drive
possibly, please?

131
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,183
Look out!

132
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,251
Shit!

133
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,058
Oh, shit!

134
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,129
You almost hit her.

135
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,639
What the fuck

136
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,664
was she doing walking
in the middle of the road?

137
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,374
Asshole.

138
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,910
Hello?
Hey, are you ok?

139
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,318
Boys, that's
a bad acid trip

140
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,549
walking
right there.

141
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,549
Hello?
Can you hear us?

142
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,459
You're gonna
get killed doing that.

143
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:47,193
Kemp, stop the van.

144
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,996
Fuck that.
We got a concert to go to.

145
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,832
We're still 3 fucking
hours from dallas!

146
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,269
Where are you going?

147
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,170
We're getting there.

148
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,334
Get away.

149
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,343
Hey...

150
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,777
just need to get away.

151
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,508
What?

152
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,516
Got to get away.

153
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,918
From who?

154
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,647
I want to go home.

155
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,245
Ok, we can't
leave her

156
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,755
out here
like this.

157
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,257
Hey, let us
help you, ok?

158
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,259
Come on.

159
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,261
Come on.
It's ok.

160
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,729
It's ok.

161
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,231
It's ok, man.

162
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,700
We'll give you a ride,
wherever you want to go.

163
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,703
I want to go home.

164
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,602
Ok, we can
take you home.

165
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,758
Um... what's your name?

166
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,284
They're all dead.

167
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,692
Oh, my god. I am
way too stoned for this.

168
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,130
Baby, let's find
a hospital, ok?

169
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,697
You know what?
Give me the vaguest idea

170
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,573
where there is one,
and we'll go there.

171
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,272
Um... who's dead?

172
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,550
Kemper, didn't
your mother ever tell you

173
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,314
not to pick up
hitchhikers?

174
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,259
No.

175
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,696
You're going
the wrong way.

176
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,495
Stop! You're
going the wrong way!

177
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,900
Hey, hey, hey!

178
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,339
Jesus christ.

179
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,505
You can't make me
go back there.

180
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,106
I won't go back there.

181
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,151
Back where?

182
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,260
He's a bad man.

183
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,822
He's a really bad man.

184
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,372
He's a bad man.

185
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,966
Oh, my god.
Oh, shit.

186
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,006
You're all gonna die.

187
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,481
Drop it.
Drop it.

188
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,921
Let me out!
Oh, my god!

189
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,955
Are you
all right?

190
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,389
It's too much.
I'm ok. I'm ok.

191
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,826
Aah! Aah!
Oh, my god!

192
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,329
Let me see.

193
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,796
It's all over me!

194
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,799
It's gone.
It's gone. Look.

195
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,425
I could have fucking
died out there!

196
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,493
We all could
have, morgan.

197
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,806
Did that
just happen?

198
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,312
I've never seen
anybody die before.

199
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,076
Yeah, most people
never do.

200
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,514
I really don't see

201
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,017
how that's helping
us right now, man.

202
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,916
I don't know
why we had to pick her up.

203
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,156
Why the fuck
did we have to stop?

204
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,555
She needed help!

205
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,890
A lot of fucking
help we did her!

206
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,055
Leave her alone.

207
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,428
Fuck!

208
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,392
I just don't understand.

209
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,905
Why did she do it?

210
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,407
And why did she
have to pick us?

211
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,842
Why did she
have to pick us?

212
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,449
What are we
gonna do?

213
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,856
I don't know.
We're gonna...

214
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,162
we're gonna have to
call the cops, i guess.

215
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,324
Yeah, on the list
of bad ideas,

216
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,128
that one goes
way up there.

217
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,135
Are you kidding me?

218
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,500
Oh, police officer,
please,

219
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,004
as you inspect
the crime scene,

220
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,506
which is now
our van,

221
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,030
please ignore
the colorful pinata

222
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,167
filled
with marijuana

223
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,541
you may just happen
to come across,

224
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,908
because it played
no part whatsoever

225
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,346
in the demise of this
unfortunate young woman.

226
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,851
Listen... keep
your goddamn voice down.

227
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,386
Easy, easy, easy.

228
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,412
Goddamn it.

229
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,397
Well, you're not gonna
listen to him.

230
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,763
What the fuck
are you doing?

231
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,233
Uh!

232
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,436
It's over, man.

233
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,274
Kemp, you just can't
throw the shit out.

234
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,149
You ok?

235
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,654
Baby...

236
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,317
i'm sorry, ok? I...

237
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,327
i did it for us.

238
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,320
I did it so we could
start a life, you know.

239
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,857
I'm sorry. Ok?

240
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,342
Well, i'll tell you this much...
there's no possible way

241
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,142
i'm ever getting back
in that van.

242
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,453
I guess that's what
brains look like, huh?

243
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,901
Sort of like,
uh... lasagna...

244
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,427
kind of.

245
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,900
All right,
i'll shut up now.

246
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,318
I'll tell you
this much...

247
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,319
the next hitchhiker
is shit out of luck.

248
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,083
I swear to god.

249
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,590
Dude, gas station.

250
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:53,414
Come on, erin.
Let's find the bathroom.

251
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,471
Well, i'll be damned.

252
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,832
Ma'am, we need
to report a suicide.

253
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,710
Something like this
comes along,

254
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,270
it makes folks realize

255
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,816
how crazy the world
is out there.

256
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,977
Right.

257
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,078
Would you mind calling
the sheriff, ma'am?

258
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,783
It's gonna cost you
10 cents.

259
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,131
You want some pig?

260
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,610
Big brothers.

261
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,650
I just feel
so disgusting.

262
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,860
Oh, there's about
6 of them altogether,

263
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:08,197
counting the dead one.
Poor thing. It's awful.

264
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,600
Well, why don't you
ask them yourself?

265
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,505
Right. Where did you say
you found her again?

266
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,270
Ma'am, i already
told you.

267
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,300
About 10 minutes
west of here.

268
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,406
About 5 miles west.

269
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,418
Ma'am, excuse me.

270
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,580
When is the sheriff
gonna be here?

271
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,122
Sheriff said
he's headed over

272
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,181
to the old
crawford mill.

273
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,419
I'm sorry.
The what?

274
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,326
The old crawford mill.
He wants to know

275
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,331
if you wouldn't mind
driving over there

276
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,333
to make your report.

277
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,493
Yes.

278
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,126
Yes, we
goddamn mind.

279
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,828
I'm sorry,
but how often

280
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,840
do girls just blow
their heads off

281
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,774
in this shit-hole town?

282
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,504
All right,
just calm down, ok?

283
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,341
Let me... i'm sorry.
I apologize.

284
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,880
But, ma'am,
i don't understand.

285
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,381
Why the hell
won't the sheriff

286
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,883
just come out here?

287
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,817
Didn't say.
He said it would be

288
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,844
about 2 hours
before he could get here.

289
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,752
We're not gonna drive
around this town

290
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,725
with a dead girl
in the back of our van!

291
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,256
Young man...

292
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,666
what you do
is your own business.

293
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,817
Come on.

294
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,980
Get in.

295
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,325
I just want
to go home, ok?

296
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,351
That's fine.

297
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,166
It's starting
to stink back here.

298
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,469
No worse than the inside
of that fucking store.

299
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,668
Did you smell
that nasty beef shit?

300
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,378
Oh, my god.

301
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,216
Guys.

302
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,742
Hello!

303
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,239
Hello?

304
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,025
Ain't no
sheriff here.

305
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,554
I think we should
drop off the body

306
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,123
and get the hell
out of here.

307
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,729
Maybe we should
vote on it.

308
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,763
Kemper, no.

309
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,369
Why not, erin?
It is a democracy.

310
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,902
Well, how would
you like it

311
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,108
if we just dumped
your body out here?

312
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,207
I'm sorry.
Nobody asked her

313
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,273
to blow her head off
in our van.

314
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,375
My van.

315
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,383
I say we dump her.

316
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,827
Pig.

317
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,990
Cool. All right. Fine.

318
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,863
2 votes.

319
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,666
Now we just need
one more. Kemper?

320
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,673
One more and we're
out of here.

321
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,402
Kemper, please?

322
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,711
Baby, she's dead.

323
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,383
I just...
i really don't think

324
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,322
it matters
where we leave her.

325
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,383
Well, it matters to me...
if that means anything.

326
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,985
Erin, look...

327
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,461
that girl has got parents
out there somewhere

328
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,861
who's gonna want her back,

329
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,490
not just dumped
on the side of the road

330
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,161
like a piece of trash.

331
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:47,134
You see our lone ranger
anywhere?

332
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,945
Maybe this
isn't the crawford mill.

333
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,149
It's unbelievable.

334
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,952
This is a joke.

335
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,323
There's nobody here.

336
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,361
There's no sheriff here.

337
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,757
What?

338
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,165
I just saw something
move in there.

339
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,499
I just saw something.

340
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,833
I swear to god,

341
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,168
i just saw something
move in there.

342
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,833
You're just trying
to scare me into leaving.

343
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,171
Erin, come on.

344
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,506
Go to hell.

345
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,805
Erin, come on.
Quit screwing around.

346
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,599
Aah! Kemper!

347
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,699
Erin!

348
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,903
Erin!

349
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,344
Erin, where are you?

350
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,324
All right.

351
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,348
Go.

352
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,333
I got it.

353
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,857
Ok.

354
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,273
Damn it!
Give me...

355
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,406
give me something
to hold this.

356
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:36,011
It's a possum,
indigenous to the...

357
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,424
i didn't do that.

358
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,921
All right.

359
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,402
All right, that's it!
If somebody's out there,

360
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,904
just stop fucking around,
all right?

361
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,134
I mean it!
Just come on out!

362
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,221
Who are you?

363
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,419
What did you do to her?

364
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,895
Huh?

365
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,730
The girl out there,
in the van.

366
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,236
We didn't do
anything to her.

367
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,738
She did that
to herself.

368
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,871
Oh, my god.

369
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,388
Promise
you won't hurt me?

370
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,259
Hey, you make these?

371
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,777
Hey, bud. Hey.

372
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,304
This is the old
crawford mill, right?

373
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,778
My name is erin.

374
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,687
Jedidiah.

375
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,260
Hey, junior.

376
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,561
So, we're waiting here
for the sheriff.

377
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,191
Do you know
where he is?

378
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,162
Ok. Well... where?

379
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,465
Home...
getting drunk.

380
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,442
So, cool.
Um, let's split.

381
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,341
If the sheriff
doesn't give a shit,

382
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,107
then why should we?

383
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,910
Does he live
around here?

384
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,342
You know,
front-row tickets

385
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,388
to a big concert.

386
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,515
Can we drive
there from here?

387
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,752
Road don't go there.

388
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,260
Short walk, though.

389
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,886
I think
we should go,

390
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,261
like now,
like right now.

391
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,225
How do i get
to the sheriff's?

392
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,339
Whoa! Hey, you sick
little mutant.

393
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on now. Let go.

394
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,212
Get out of here.

395
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,872
That's
police evidence.

396
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,250
Is anybody home?

397
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,481
Hello!

398
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,012
What do you want?

399
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,819
Um... are you
the sheriff?

400
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,326
Do i look
like a sheriff?

401
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,522
I don't know.
I can't see you.

402
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,360
Stand back
from the door.

403
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,639
Sheriff don't live here.

404
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,770
You can call him
if you want to.

405
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,839
Thanks. We'd really
appreciate it.

406
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,919
Wipe your feet.

407
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,252
I like to keep
a clean house.

408
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,252
I said
she could call him.

409
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,388
You wait outside.

410
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,624
Ok, chief.

411
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,496
I ain't looking
for trouble.

412
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,761
Don't shoot.

413
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,001
There.

414
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,759
I'll dial him
for you.

415
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,750
Hello?

416
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,844
Hi. Is... is this
the sheriff's office?

417
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,014
Can i speak
to him, please?

418
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,237
Oh, thank god.

419
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,831
Now, it's just
an educated guess,

420
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,334
but my money says
your dead body

421
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,996
is right there
in that van.

422
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,733
30 minutes? Believe me,
we will be there.

423
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,648
Thanks. I'm all set.

424
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,844
Wait. Wait.

425
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,787
Can you help me out
back here?

426
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,271
Are you ok?

427
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,603
Could you just...

428
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,938
ok.

429
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,552
Excuse me.

430
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,850
Erin?

431
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,019
Excuse me.

432
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,861
Erin?

433
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,841
Excuse me.
You mind getting

434
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,883
the fuck out
of my way, son?

435
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,353
We picked her up

436
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,390
on the side
of the road, like...

437
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,916
wow. Look at that mess.

438
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,702
Who's this belong to?

439
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,766
She had that
on her, sir.

440
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,312
You don't say.

441
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,848
Had it on her?

442
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,442
Yes, sir.

443
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,390
Ok, if you could
just relax,

444
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,361
because you're
not helping.

445
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,466
Good girl,
good girl.

446
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,379
Pig sty.

447
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,961
Oh, jesus.

448
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,102
What the hell
was that?

449
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,870
Kemper?

450
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,041
Kemp?

451
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,584
Ha. Well, let's get her
wrapped up.

452
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,337
Oh, preffy
little thing.

453
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,103
How about giving me
a hand here, asshole?

454
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:02,272
You don't expect me
to do this by myself?

455
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,815
I need some help.

456
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,320
Why do i always get
yanked into this shit?

457
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,946
What am i doing?

458
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,148
Lift her up
and just kind of

459
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,851
pull her over
your way there.

460
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,358
She ain't
gonna bite you.

461
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,951
She's deader than
a goddamn doornail.

462
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,825
Get ahold of her
and pick her up.

463
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,353
Yes, sir.

464
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,200
Oh, yeah.
There you go.

465
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,836
I bet she's
real unhappy,

466
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,341
real sorry that you're
getting fuckin' her blood

467
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,345
all over
your goddamn arm.

468
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,848
You know, back when
i was a young patrolman,

469
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,383
i used to love wrapping up
these young honies.

470
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,885
Yeah, i bet you did.

471
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,887
Yeah, cop me
a little bit of a feel

472
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,855
every now and then,
you know.

473
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,884
Oh, look at that.
She's kind of wet down there.

474
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,520
What you boys been doing

475
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,053
with this dead body anyway?

476
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,328
Can we please
finish this?

477
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,803
Kemper?

478
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,301
Kemp?

479
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,398
Something wrong?

480
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,171
Where is he?

481
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,700
I don't know.

482
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,736
But he's not
in my house.

483
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,782
Thanks.

484
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,051
Kemper?

485
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,522
Kemp?

486
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,729
Goddamn him.

487
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,707
Ok, boys, there you go.
There she is.

488
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,709
Let's get her
out of there now.

489
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,768
You, four-eyes, get a hold
of her legs there.

490
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,280
Get after
that part of it.

491
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,782
I got her head.

492
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,272
Oh...

493
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,317
fuck.

494
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,251
Come on.

495
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,947
Ow! Shit.

496
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,048
Just stick her
in the back seat.

497
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,356
It just seems
so wrong.

498
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,830
Don't give me
any crap, young lady.

499
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,833
Goddamn it, i got
just as much respect

500
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,631
for a dead body
as anybody around here.

501
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:42,332
Hey! Get that nasty
goddamn thing

502
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,841
out of the back seat
of my goddamn car!

503
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,343
Put it in the trunk.

504
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,877
What the hell's
the matter with you?

505
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,215
Put the legs.

506
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,512
Don't break
my stuff.

507
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,743
Put the legs in.

508
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,254
Y'all gonna be able

509
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,761
to find your way
out of here ok?

510
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,262
Yeah. Yeah,
we'll be fine.

511
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,628
All right, then.

512
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,269
Protect and serve.
That's what we do.

513
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,794
That you did, sir.

514
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,302
Kemp!

515
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,152
Kemper!

516
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,806
Kemper!

517
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,280
Poor kemp. I mean,
he ain't ever

518
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,323
gonna get the stink
out of this van.

519
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,326
You think we should try
to clean it for him?

520
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,351
Be my guest.

521
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,928
You ok?

522
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,699
It's too much.
I'm gonna be sick.

523
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,833
Ok, good news.
Sheriff's on his way.

524
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,866
The sheriff already came.

525
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,472
He took the body.

526
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,708
Where's kemper?

527
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,546
Isn't he with you?

528
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,757
Kemper?

529
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,691
What the hell is that?

530
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,456
Kemper!

531
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,790
Kemp!

532
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,476
There's nobody
even here.

533
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:44,855
Kemp!

534
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,481
What was that
all about?

535
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,925
Kemper!

536
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,396
What is that?
Oh...

537
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,456
it's somebody's
fucking teeth, isn't it?

538
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,399
Pepper, look, just
calm down, all right?

539
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,733
Erin, find your goddamn
boyfriend. It's time to go.

540
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,233
Kemper!

541
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,004
Kemp!

542
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,918
Morgan, what
are you doing?

543
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,056
Help him! Help him!

544
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,725
Oh, my god!

545
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,165
Pull him! Pull him!

546
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,600
I can't!

547
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,102
Oh, my god.

548
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,263
Ha ha ha!

549
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,272
You stupid...

550
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,796
that's not funny.

551
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,911
Oh, what the hell
is that?

552
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,678
Is that the girl
from our van?

553
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,211
That's her.

554
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,521
Is that her family?

555
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,564
What were
they all doing here?

556
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,570
They were probably
looking for the sheriff.

557
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,305
It's fucking weird.

558
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,399
All right, you know what?

559
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,909
Let's find
kemper

560
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,638
and get the hell
out of here.

561
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,374
Where you going?

562
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,680
To find him.

563
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,813
Well, where are
the keys for the van?

564
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,750
Well, who put you
in charge?

565
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,227
If you guys just want
to take off, that's fine,

566
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,732
but i am not
getting in that van

567
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,233
and leaving
without him.

568
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,394
Give me the keys.

569
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,836
Don't even
think about it.

570
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,930
Andy...

571
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,907
i don't know about
you guys, but i happen

572
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,739
to like my teeth
right where they are.

573
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,335
I can't leave him.

574
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,347
Let's go.

575
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,314
We'll meet you
back at the van.

576
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,821
I know
kemp's in there.

577
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,225
Wonderful.

578
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,923
All right,
keep him busy.

579
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,899
Hi. It's me again.

580
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,908
I'm really sorry
to bother you,

581
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,445
but i can't find
my boyfriend kemper anywhere,

582
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,447
and i thought
i would just...

583
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,574
ain't you supposed
to meet the sheriff?

584
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,352
Kemper?

585
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,860
Kemp, don't mess around.

586
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,308
Um... wow. What... what
a wonderful garden you have.

587
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:31,940
It's just so...
plentiful. Ha ha.

588
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,355
Oh!

589
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,569
Damn it!

590
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,970
Andy!

591
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,983
Hey, you can't
just go in my house!

592
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,416
Andy!

593
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,380
Are you ok?

594
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,117
Yeah.

595
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,796
What the hell are you doing
in my house?

596
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,332
All right, look.
We're just looking

597
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,767
for our friend,
all right?

598
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,064
Then we'll be
out of here.

599
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,163
You ain't
running things, boy...

600
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,764
exceptin' your mouth.

601
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,900
This guy's crazy.

602
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,275
You little turd,

603
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,076
you're so dead,
you don't even know it.

604
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,477
Come on, boy.

605
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,078
Bring it!

606
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,486
Bring it.

607
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:20,888
Bring what?

608
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:21,891
Bring it.

609
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,597
Shit!

610
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,441
Come on!

611
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,500
Andy!

612
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,451
Get the fuck
out of here! Run!

613
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,758
Shit! God!

614
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,977
Please!

615
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,954
Please! Stop! No!

616
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,787
Please! Put me...

617
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,585
shit!

618
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,223
Erin! Erin!

619
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,927
Erin!

620
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,367
Ugh! Kemper really
owes us for this.

621
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,611
What the fuck's
wrong, erin?

622
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,943
Erin, are you ok?

623
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,849
Where's the gun?
Come on!

624
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,148
Erin, what's
going on?

625
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,848
Where's the gun?

626
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,982
The sheriff
took it.

627
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,150
Shit!

628
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,320
Erin, what the fuck's
going on? Calm down!

629
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,386
Fuck!

630
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,657
What?
What?

631
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,331
Oh, thank god.
Oh, thank god.

632
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,836
Take it easy.

633
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,838
Thank god. My friend...
my friend needs help!

634
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,840
My friend right now...
my friend's dying!

635
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,432
My friend's being hurt!

636
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,444
Take a couple
of deep breaths.

637
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,342
There's some guy...
just...

638
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,608
just quiet down.

639
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:00,815
Please.

640
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,751
Now, what's wrong
with your car?

641
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,754
There's nothing
wrong with my car.

642
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,085
Whoa.

643
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,591
It's my friend.
Please help him.

644
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,253
I don't know
where he is anymore.

645
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,559
Somebody want to
explain this?

646
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:17,089
Lt... that's not mine.

647
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,831
You kids
taking drugs?

648
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,202
No.
No.

649
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,230
It's not our van.

650
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:31,175
I smell bullshit.

651
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,285
Get out of the van!

652
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,786
Out!

653
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:45,655
On your faces,
all 3 of you!

654
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,630
Get on the ground!

655
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,703
Arizona...

656
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,229
colorado...

657
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,970
new york.

658
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,205
Please, you've
got to help us!

659
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,907
He's fucking
killing him!

660
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,745
Now we're getting
someplace.

661
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,183
Who's killing who?

662
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,617
There's
some fucking guy

663
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,245
with a fucking
chainsaw!

664
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,257
Get your sweet little ass
back in the dirt

665
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,055
until i say otherwise.

666
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,292
You know what i think?

667
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,767
I think your boyfriend
shot that little girl

668
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,463
and then he ran off.

669
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:34,970
He did not!

670
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,700
Some fucking guy
with a...

671
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,736
stop! Stop!

672
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,279
We're all gonna die!

673
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,270
You girls better get yourselves
under control,

674
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,282
or i'm gonna have to
do it for you.

675
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,307
Why won't you
listen to her?

676
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,287
Get on your feet.

677
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,755
Get over
by the van.

678
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,779
Please stop.

679
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:58,225
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

680
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:01,992
I want to know exactly
what happened inside that van.

681
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,728
We already told you
what happened.

682
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,737
And now you're
gonna show me.

683
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,819
Is that where
she was sitting?

684
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,688
Because the angle
don't add up for me

685
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,193
with the blood
on that back window.

686
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,635
Maybe she was
a bit more in the middle.

687
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,834
Well, maybe
you ought to move

688
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,275
a little more
over to the middle.

689
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,869
But...

690
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,683
what, are you afraid
of a little blood?

691
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,281
Get the fuck
over there!

692
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,757
I don't have much
of an imagination,

693
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:47,463
so i need to get
a distinct image

694
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,904
of what
went down here.

695
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,033
What did
she do next?

696
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,441
She...

697
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,948
she shot herself.

698
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,041
Oh, she
shot herself.

699
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,679
How?

700
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,381
What do you mean, how?

701
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:09,051
Take the gun.

702
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,821
Take the gun
and show me

703
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,887
how she did it.
Come on.

704
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,798
Take the gun.
Take the gun

705
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,098
and show me.

706
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,970
Take the goddamn gun!

707
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,742
Is that
how she did it?

708
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,544
Yes. Yes, sir.

709
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,551
You're
a fucking liar.

710
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,052
There ain't no hole

711
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,317
in the bottom of
her chin. I looked.

712
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,881
She stuck
the goddamn weapon

713
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,552
into her mouth.

714
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,424
Didn't she?

715
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,961
Show me
how she did it.

716
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,696
Do it!
Please...

717
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,499
show me.

718
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,738
Please, please, please,
please, please...

719
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,266
that a boy.
There you go.

720
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,279
And then what
did she do?

721
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,281
She shot herself.

722
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,284
You ain't lying
to me again, are you?

723
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,319
Because i have never
seen a weapon go off

724
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,187
without somebody's finger
on the fucking trigger.

725
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,749
Morgan, what's going on?
You ok?

726
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,159
You girls
stay in the dirt

727
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,390
till i tell you
different.

728
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,424
You mother fucker!
Get on the fucking floor!

729
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:27,163
I said get on the floor!

730
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,637
What the hell
are you doing?

731
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,163
What are you
gonna do, shoot me?

732
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,505
Morgan, please,
please.

733
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,032
Just please put
the gun down, ok?

734
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,270
Please don't do it.

735
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,540
Oh, my god. Morgan.

736
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,415
You lyin' fuck!

737
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,905
You could kill me
right now,

738
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,815
get out of here
scot-free, couldn't you?

739
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,614
Morgan, please,
just put it down.

740
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:47,555
He shoots me,
you're accomplices to murder!

741
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,024
Morgan...

742
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,755
please. Please!
Come on!

743
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,491
Morgan! Damn!

744
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,260
Fucking shoot him!

745
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,494
Morgan,
put the gun down.

746
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,230
Shoot him!
Don't fucking do it!

747
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,205
You don't have
the fucking balls, do you?

748
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,466
Pull the fucking trigger!

749
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,569
Fuck you!

750
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,717
Well, well, well.
Looky here.

751
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,084
Oh, my god, morgan.

752
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,316
We got ourselves
a killer,

753
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,052
only this time,

754
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,026
you killed
a sheriff.

755
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,457
I ought to blow
your fucking brains

756
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,265
out right now,
asshole.

757
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,067
Get out of the van.

758
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,801
Get out.

759
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,366
Get out of the van.

760
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,080
Morgan.

761
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,844
Where are you
taking him?

762
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,383
What are you doing?

763
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,886
Where are you taking him?
Jesus christ!

764
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,912
Get the fuck
away from me!

765
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,173
Man, this is bullshit.

766
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,817
I have rights.

767
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,783
Yeah, you got
rights, ok.

768
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,417
Where was
y'all headed?

769
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:03,926
Dallas...

770
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,293
for a skynyrd concert.

771
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:11,198
Skynyrd? Hell,
i like skynyrd.

772
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,758
By god,
how about that?

773
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,100
We got something
in common, don't we?

774
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,628
Ha ha ha.

775
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,265
Well, what
are you gonna do

776
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,708
with your tickets
now, hot shot?

777
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,149
You can have them.

778
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,947
Is that bribery?

779
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,386
Oh, that was really
rude, wasn't it?

780
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,764
Oh, look at you.

781
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,394
How about that?

782
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,839
Look at that shit.

783
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:54,002
We got something
else in common now.

784
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,910
Ha ha ha. See that?

785
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,748
Get on over to the damn
crawford mill.

786
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,248
Those 2 fillies
are good to go.

787
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,268
Shit.

788
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,270
What do you think
he's doing to morgan?

789
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,467
I don't want to
think about it, ok?

790
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,809
Oh, shit!

791
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,781
Pepper, i need you

792
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,818
to hold that light
really steady.

793
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,979
Can you do that?

794
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,530
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

795
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,401
In juvie. They call
my youth misspent.

796
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,200
Oh, thank god.

797
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,315
Get out of the car.

798
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:17,792
Where are we?

799
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,318
That's none of your
goddamn business, faggot!

800
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:22,957
Just get out
of the goddamn car!

801
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,901
You kids shouldn't have
messed with that little girl.

802
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:40,109
You brought this all
on yourself.

803
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,811
Now get the hell
in the house!

804
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,485
Come on, please.

805
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,751
Come on.

806
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,685
Come on.

807
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,696
Come on, erin.
Come on!

808
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,163
Yes!
Yes!

809
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,791
Go, go, go!

810
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,814
Aah! Go! Go!

811
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,680
Help, pepper! No!

812
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:05,523
Pepper!

813
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,806
Run!

814
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,911
No! No, pepper!

815
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,330
Please! Please!
Please let me in!

816
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:11,333
Please! Help me, please!

817
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,858
Come on. Come on.

818
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,325
Why don't you
have a seat?

819
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,488
It's ok. Sit down.

820
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,762
Have a seat.

821
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:48,202
Turn that thing off!
He's gonna fucking hear us!

822
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,248
There's nothing a good old
cup of tea won't settle.

823
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:10,056
Nobody's gonna come
through that door.

824
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,755
I really need
to use your phone.

825
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:14,820
We don't have one.

826
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,492
Phones are a hassle.

827
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,903
No! Don't you get it?

828
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,534
He's gonna kill you.
He's gonna kill all of us.

829
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,136
Oh, no, he won't.

830
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,703
Yes, he will.

831
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:36,775
He knows better than
to be messing around here.

832
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:40,311
Everyone around here
knows that...

833
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,483
poor sweet boy.

834
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,958
Sweet boy.

835
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,893
He's no harm.

836
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,897
He always keeps
to himself.

837
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,890
Skin disease.

838
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,962
He was just a little boy
when it started.

839
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,440
Didn't you look
at his face?

840
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,675
I couldn't.
I couldn't look at him.

841
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:07,011
Oh, sweetie. Here.

842
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,581
Here. It's just...
just right.

843
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,318
Come drink some
before it gets cold.

844
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,258
You have no idea.

845
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:22,064
Hush now.

846
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,157
I don't want to drink
any more tea!

847
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,497
I just need a phone!

848
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,504
Now you see
what you've done?

849
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,339
Oh. Ha ha...

850
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,434
that wasn't
a good idea.

851
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,744
Now, drink up your tea.

852
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,084
It'll help you relax.

853
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,920
I'll be right back.

854
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,888
You're
a little tense.

855
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,162
You should relax.

856
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,975
I got to go.

857
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:48,844
You ok, child?

858
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,182
You don't look
so good.

859
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:56,517
I thought you said
you didn't have a phone.

860
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,017
It's ok.
It's all right.

861
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,397
That's not your baby.

862
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,598
You stole her!

863
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,175
She's mine.

864
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:39,929
Oh, my. Oh, my,
my, my, my, my.

865
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:43,700
Everything's gonna be fine
real soon.

866
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,537
I promise.

867
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,719
Give her some room.

868
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:07,559
Maybe she'd like to
stay for supper.

869
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,325
Messed up
everything already.

870
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,832
Stop bothering her.

871
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,834
Grandma!
Let me in now!

872
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,462
You best stay out there
with them dogs

873
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,940
till you learn
how to play by the rules.

874
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:23,036
You're not going
nowhere, honey.

875
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,281
Please. Please
just let me go.

876
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,252
I know your kind...

877
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:35,621
nothing but cruelty
and ridicule for my boy,

878
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:39,025
all the time
he was growing up.

879
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:45,266
Does anybody care
about me and my boy?

880
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,696
Huh?

881
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,262
Don't hurt her!
Please, grandma.

882
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:52,069
You shut up
out there!

883
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,339
Help me! Please!
Make them stop!

884
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,572
Looky, mama.
She likes me.

885
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:02,207
What's wrong with
you fucking people?

886
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,752
Nothing
wrong with us.

887
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,287
Tommy.

888
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,822
Help me, please!

889
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,757
Thomas brown hewitt,

No! No!

892
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,265
Get her out of my sight.

893
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,664
No! Please! No!

894
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,793
Please!

895
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,602
Will you cut out
that racket?

Here's
your pants.

897
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:30,801
Thank you.

898
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,811
No!

899
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,758
Oh, my god.

01:08:56,298 --> 01:09:00,200

Ok.

Lift your body.

905
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,841
Stop!

Sorry.

910
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,609
Erin, i'm dead.

911
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,577
Please finish it.

912
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,581
You can do it.

913
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,277
I can't.

914
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,278
I can't. I can't.
I can't.

915
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,879
There's a knife.

916
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,985
Erin...

917
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,383

01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,557

Do it!

921
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,996
I can't do it.

922
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,098
Do it!

923
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,749
Do it. Do it.

Please forgive me.

01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,263
Morgan, it's me!

927
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:16,389
Help me!

928
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,900

Over here.

Let's go. Walk.
We need you to lead us.

Get up there!

01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,414

01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:47,444
Go! Go!

951
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:51,158
I'll be fine.

952
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,480
Come on, morgan!
Come on!

953
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:01,696
Morgan, the couch!

954
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:04,290
The couch!

955
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,707
No!

956
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,721
Come on!

Come on.

01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,856
No!

962
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:48,294
Aah! No!

963
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,323
Stop! No! Please! No!

964
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,800
Erin!

965
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,462
No!

966
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,665
Aah!

967
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:58,866
No!

968
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:01,967
Stop! Uh!

01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,816
Erin!

971
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,316
Morgan!

972
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,755
Morgan!

973
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:24,087
Get off him!
Get off him!

974
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:46,349
No!

975
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,480

Please! I need help!
I need help! Help!

01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,308
Let me in!

984
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,862
Oh, my god.

985
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:50,992
Hey!

986
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:57,160
Hey!

987
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:43,360
Goddamn it!

988
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:06,993
Stop! Stop! Please!

989
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:08,290
Stop!

990
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,769
Hey there.
You all right?

991
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:26,302
Huh? Are you ok?

992
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,941
Here. Come on.
Let's get

993
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,952
in my truck
over here.

994
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,665
You in a car wreck?

995
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,668
Where are we going?

996

Honey,

998
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:02,213
Huh?

I just want
to go home.

1000
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,556
You live
around here?

1001
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:10,922
No.

1002
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,619

1007
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,399

01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:32,936
Keep going!

1010
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:39,150
Stop it!
Please don't stop!

1011
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,320
I don't know what
your problem is,

1012
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,884
but i can't
take this.

1013
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,452
Don't get out.

1014
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,259

01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:20,991
What do you want?

1019
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,587
I picked up a girl.
She's bloody.

1020
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,757
She's out here
in my truck.

1021
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:28,166

Henrietta.

1027
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:43,773
I give her a ride.

1028
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,910
I found her running
down the highway.

1029
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,079
I don't know her name.

1030
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:50,823
She grabbed
the steering wheel

1031
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:53,326
and dang near
run me off the road.

1032
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,329
She nearly caused us
to crash.

1033
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,160
Yes, she grabbed it
while i was driving.

1034
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:59,428
She's hysterical.

1035
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,197
She's out there
in the truck.

1036
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:04,227
I've never seen
anything like it.

1037
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,445
The baby's gone!

1038
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:32,426
Come on. Come on.

Come on, you bitch, start!

1041
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:17,535
Fuck you!

01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,400
We're gonna go and move
into the actual furnace room.

1046
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,898
Watch yourself.
Look out.

1047
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:58,946
Oh, man. Ugh...

1048
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:02,279

You got it?

1049
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:06,286
All right. This is
the actual furnace room

1050
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:11,291
we're going into where they are
suspected to have perpetrated...

1051
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,817
got a bit
of a jump there.

1052
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,329
Got it?

1053
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,332
That's ok. Don't worry.

1054
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:19,890
Come on back here.
Follow me.

1055
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:21,265
Come...

1056
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:32,638
the crime scene
was not properly secured

1057
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:34,977
by travis county police.

1058
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:38,383
2 investigating officers
were fatally wounded that day.

1059
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:42,355
This is the only known image
of thomas hewitt,

1060
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:45,392
the man they call
leatherface.

1061
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:48,918
The case today
still remains open.
