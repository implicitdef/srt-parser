00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,673
You want to be careful, Frank.

169
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,075
That can be dangerous.

170
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:21,576
I think we should call the police.

171
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:22,811
I think we should tell them
what happened,

172
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,045
about Kit Walker,

173
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,513
about Sister Felicity,

174
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:26,848
about that...

175
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,650
monster. And what about you?

176
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:31,152
You shot and killed

177
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,553
an unarmed woman, Frank.

178
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:33,755
Are you quite sure you want

179
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:35,323
to bring the authorities into this?

180
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,258
Yeah, I'm ready to face
whatever consequences

181
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,392
come from it.

182
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,228
I'll see what I can do.

183
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:50,271
("God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" playing)

184
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,114
(sighs)

185
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,885
I've been asking myself

186
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:06,320
how is it the Devil can
move so freely here

187
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:08,089
among the sacred icons?

188
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,958
How does a demon wear a crucifix

189
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:13,028
and not burn the flesh it inhabits?

190
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,296
And then I realized...

191
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,365
it's her.

192
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,434
You're using

193
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:22,405
Mary Eunice... her purity...
as a shield.

194
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:26,108
What if I were to slit this soft throat

195
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:28,578
and release her soul to Heaven,

196
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:30,380
then where would you go, foul thing?

197
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,716
Might just jump into you.

198
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:34,784
You made a big mistake coming back here.

199
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:36,520
No, you made a mistake.

200
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:39,956
And I'm about to send you back
to the hell that made you.

201
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:42,091
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

202
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,260
Cane the Devil out of me?

203
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:48,498
This demon, it tricks you.

204
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,638
(knocking on door)
Sister, may I have a word?

205
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,681
Dr. Arden...

206
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:04,682
(sighs)

207
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,585
...call security.

208
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:07,652
We have an intruder.

209
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:12,957
You're making a mistake, Doctor.

210
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,959
Because you deny God, you can't see
the Devil right in front of you.

211
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:16,694
See that she doesn't
come back on the property.

212
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:29,807
We have a problem.

213
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,942
I can handle Jude.

214
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,045
I didn't mean Jude,

215
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:36,380
although I wouldn't underestimate her,

216
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:38,482
if I were you.

217
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,551
Our former Irish cop is feeling

218
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,586
the need to confess.

219
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:45,956
I've got it under control.

220
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:51,161
(hinges creaking)

221
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:52,229
(grunts)

222
00:10:53,732 --> 00:10:56,234
Oh, Sister Jude.

223
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,736
I thought you never
wanted to see me again.

224
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:59,304
Jude is gone.

225
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,281
There's been a change in management.

226
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,184
Try to remain presentable.

227
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:13,986
There's a photographer coming

228
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:16,288
from the <i>Gazette</i> to take our picture.

229
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:19,591
<i>I would like to see</i>
<i>bright, shining faces</i>

230
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,794
delighting in your bag of chestnuts

231
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:24,095
and your new hymnal... Sister?

232
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,431
Gifts from the Monsignor himself.

233
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,199
The-The-These cuffs, huh?

234
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:31,403
They're heavy, and they dig in.

235
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,104
Where's your Christmas spirit, Sister?

236
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:36,474
What do you take
me for, an idiot? Huh?

237
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:40,645
You killed 18 people from
five families in one night.

238
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:44,149
You might expect to remain in irons

239
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:45,684
for the rest of your life.

240
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,652
Well, I don't want to be
in your shitty picture, then.

241
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,389
I don't want to be any
part of your damn lie.

242
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,723
Yeah, what lie is that?

243
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,125
Nothing like a picture
of happy, shiny faces

244
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,195
to take away the guilt
of locking us away.

245
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:58,497
You got that backwards,
Mr. Emerson.

246
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:01,700
The picture is to remind the public

247
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:03,935
that without Briarcliff,

248
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:07,906
you would be out there,
living among them.

249
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:10,542
And that's why you will
be front and center,

250
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,478
shackled...

251
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,181
and under control.

252
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:20,886
What's he doing?

253
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,121
Who, Sean? He's handing out
the presents like you asked.

254
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,625
He's wearing that silly hat
and that ridiculous beard.

255
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:28,627
Now, I thought I very was clear

256
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,696
about how I wanted Christmas celebrated.

257
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,731
All respect, Sister, I really
don't see the problem with it.

258
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,000
The-The patients love it,

259
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,236
it makes Sean and the boys happy.

260
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:38,671
And St. Nicholas was a saint.

261
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:39,906
SISTER EUNICE:
The photographer's here!

262
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,776
Sister Jude, the newspaper
photographer is here.

263
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:46,846
SISTER JUDE:
I thought we decided

264
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,247
that you would bring
him in when we were ready.

265
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:49,482
I'm sorry. Are we not ready?

266
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:58,324
(spitting, yelling)

267
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:00,293
Take him to the hole!

268
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:04,431
Oh, you really don't want me
out there with other people

269
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,632
this time of year.

270
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,800
Not as yourself.

271
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:09,470
Your beard goes perfectly

272
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,405
with the suit.

273
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:16,509
Jesus, you don't know
what Christmas means to me?

274
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:17,811
I do now, Leigh.

275
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,613
I know you were a petty criminal

276
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:22,349
thrown in jail for
shoplifting a loaf of bread,

277
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,418
and while you were in there,

278
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:30,090
the jailers went caroling
in the cell block,

279
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:34,427
and five men held you down

280
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,596
and took your virginity.

281
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:37,797
Well...

282
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,833
the first one did.

283
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:42,603
The others took your dignity,

284
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,606
and your self-esteem and...

285
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:48,409
most importantly...

286
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,944
(whispering):
Your Christmas spirit.

287
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,112
But then you got out

288
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,148
and you found the suit,

289
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,684
and it gave you everything
you were missing.

290
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,886
You see, I-I knew
who deserved to live

291
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:00,621
and who deserved to die.

292
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:01,889
Who was naughty, who was nice.

293
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:03,623
And you had the power, Leigh.

294
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,959
You can have it again.

295
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:07,960
Who do you want to be?

296
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,330
The victim...

297
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,536
...or the victor?

298
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:35,967
(door opens) ARDEN: Sister.

299
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,855
I hope I'm not interrupting.

300
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,389
Come on in, Arthur.

301
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,493
I was just thinking
about my Christmases.

302
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:45,554
There were so many of us

303
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:48,878
that all we got was a
tangerine and socks.

304
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:52,369
Did you celebrate Christmas
in your Nazi household?

305
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,773
We had wonderful Christmases
when I was a boy.

306
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:01,311
They're some of fondest
childhood memories.

307
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,280
And in that spirit,

308
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:04,881
I've brought you a Christmas present

309
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:07,785
since you've now become my family.

310
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,586
You're joking!

311
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:12,189
How adorable!

312
00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:14,125
Is it Tabu perfume?

313
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,563
Open it.

314
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,431
I think you'll be pleased.

315
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,233
Well, knowing you, it's probably

316
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,135
some cheap toilet water
from the Woolworth's.

317
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,436
Yardley's Lavender.

318
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,438
Christ, why even get my hopes up.

319
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:31,642
Well... la-dee-da.

320
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:37,082
Mother of God, are they real?

321
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,785
Very.

322
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:43,456
Rubies are the most glamorous of all.

323
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,224
You couldn't have found them
in this dreary town.

324
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,860
Are they family heirlooms?

325
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:50,830
They belonged to a Jewess in the camp.

326
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:54,567
She was always reminding
people that she was

327
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,669
a woman of considerable means,
and that her husband was

328
00:15:56,737 --> 00:16:00,340
an influential and
wealthy doctor in Berlin.

329
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:03,276
She was constantly complaining to me

330
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:05,611
about her stomach problems,

331
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,983
and as a doctor, I thought I
ought to do something about it.

332
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,487
So I followed her, one day,
to the latrine,

333
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,255
thinking I might diagnose her condition

334
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:17,725
if I had a stool sample.

335
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,460
She was in there,

336
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,063
on her hands and knees,

337
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,432
picking through her own feces

338
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:25,967
to retrieve those earrings.

339
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,505
She confessed to me
that she swallowed them

340
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,475
every day, day after day,

341
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,610
carrying them around inside of her,

342
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,713
as if, someday, she might return

343
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,081
to her former grandeur.

344
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,817
Poor, ridiculous woman,

345
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:45,587
she died from internal bleeding.

346
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,990
The earrings were
very hard on her intestines.

347
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,359
Obviously, I retrieved them.

348
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,797
I knew someday I'd meet
someone who was worthy

349
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,632
of their exceptional beauty.

350
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,602
You were very clever
to retrieve them, Arthur.

351
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,373
Look how beautiful they are on me.

352
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,777
They bring out the rose in my cheeks.

353
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,182
Oh...

354
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,751
you're such a sap.

355
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,085
(chuckling)

356
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:20,523
Not exactly for the reasons
you may think,

357
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:25,828
but a sap nonetheless.

358
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:28,531
I so dearly hoped you'd
throw them back in my face,

359
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,433
that you couldn't bring
yourself to touch

360
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,435
those shit-stained earrings.

361
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:35,305
I was hoping there'd be
a glimmer of horror,

362
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:38,976
a glimmer of that precious girl

363
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,178
who was too afraid

364
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,780
even to take a bite

365
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,482
of my candy apple...

366
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,683
You're pathetic.

367
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:48,786
And gee whiz,

368
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:50,555
I just hate to break it to you...

369
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:56,094
...but you're no angel either.

370
00:17:56,162 --> 00:18:00,065
Now... I have work to do,

371
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,401
and you're either with me,

372
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,204
or you're against me.

373
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:08,208
And if you're against me,

374
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:10,243
even God can't help you.

375
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:18,618
(coughing)
The cook has a terrible habit

376
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:21,021
of forgetting to wash his hands.

377
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,522
I keep telling him...

378
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,223
I haven't eaten anything.

379
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,459
I'm just upset.

380
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:29,729
I need to know if Sister Mary
Eunice talked to the police.

381
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:32,198
If Sister Mary Eunice says
she's going to do something,

382
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,266
then you have to believe
it has been done.

383
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,869
You need to stop fretting.

384
00:18:36,937 --> 00:18:38,972
(whispering voice)

385
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,907
KIT (muttering): You died.

386
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:43,477
Who is that back there?

387
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:47,080
Another unfortunate soul.

388
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:48,882
Nothing you need to
worry yourself about.

389
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:53,720
I feel much better.

390
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,790
Thank you.

391
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:02,663
(church bell tolling)

392
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,830
I don't know what to do for you, Jude.

393
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:06,333
You've lost your credibility
at Briarcliff.

394
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,435
I want to help you,
but I don't know how.

395
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:10,937
You've got to help me
get back into Briarcliff.

396
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:12,439
I don't know, Jude.

397
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,207
Look at me.

398
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,743
Don't I look different?

399
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:20,248
I'm not running anymore,

400
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:24,585
and God had a plan for me all along:

401
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,854
To be a soldier in His army,

402
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:29,190
but we're losing that war.

403
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:30,525
Did you know.

404
00:19:30,593 --> 00:19:33,561
The National Broadcasting
Company is showing.

405
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:37,097
<i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed</i>
<i>Reindeer</i> this very week?

406
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:38,932
Nothing about Christ,

407
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,434
nothing about the nativity story.

408
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:46,706
This country's turn
towards unadulterated blasphemy

409
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,641
frightens me.

410
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:51,344
It worries me deeply,

411
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:53,279
but that's how the Devil works.

412
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:55,314
Bit by bit,

413
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:58,784
he turns our eyes away from God,

414
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:01,120
but he can't have her!

415
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:04,290
No.

416
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:06,091
I will do what I can.

417
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,926
I promise, Jude.

418
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,362
(phone ringing)

419
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:11,863
Yes?

420
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:13,331
(bell tolling)

421
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:16,134
Thank you.

422
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:18,302
You have a visitor.

423
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,604
(bell tolling)

424
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,312
I can't remember the last time
I was in a house of worship.

425
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,915
Why are you here?
You and I got off

426
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:33,384
on the wrong foot
right from the very beginning.

427
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,653
Perhaps it's because we're both such

428
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:38,089
strong personalities.

429
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:40,892
But although our ideologies may differ,

430
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,493
I believe our commitment

431
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:44,162
to Briarcliff is equally matched.

432
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,631
What is this?
I think you must know

433
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,466
how hard it was for me to come here,

434
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:51,003
to turn to you, of all people.

435
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,704
I don't have time for the prologue.

436
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,439
Just say it!

437
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:58,677
You were right.

438
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:00,379
About Sister Mary Eunice.

439
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:03,582
She's in desperate trouble.

440
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,085
I had hoped to come up

441
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:08,420
with a medical explanation
for it, but...

442
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:09,722
I can't.

443
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:11,757
(thud echoing)

444
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,962
(sighs)

445
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,564
She doesn't know I'm here.

446
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:21,299
You're afraid of her.

447
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,001
No. No?

448
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,902
That's not it.

449
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,004
I have my work to do.

450
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:30,040
I can't be baby-sitting
a deranged nun all day long.

451
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:31,675
That's what you came for?

452
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:33,243
A baby-sitter?

453
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,946
Yeah. Well, go to hell.

454
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:40,117
You were right about me, too.

455
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,720
I don't believe in God.

456
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:45,922
But I do believe in evil.

457
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:50,160
I've seen it...

458
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,429
up-close and personal.

459
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:55,065
I have no doubt.

460
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,601
That's why her purity meant
so much to me.

461
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:00,237
She had this...

462
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:02,907
light in her.

463
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:05,242
The light's gone out.

464
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:08,946
Please...

465
00:22:09,013 --> 00:22:11,181
and that's not a word
I use often...

466
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,417
I'm begging you,

467
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:15,252
please help me.

468
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,589
I'm doing this for her, not you.

469
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:22,126
You must follow my every instruction.

470
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:23,761
No questions asked.

471
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:24,862
You swear to me?

472
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,331
I swear.

473
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:31,769
♪ O, holy night... ♪

474
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:33,504
There you go. Thank you.

475
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:34,939
♪ The stars are
brightly shining... ♪

476
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:36,974
(speaking quietly)
...Merry Christmas.

477
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:38,609
I'd like to present you all

478
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,145
with this star,

479
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:45,015
this... beacon

480
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:47,084
of Bethlehem.

481
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:50,354
It was hand-crafted
for the Archdiocese of Boston.

482
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:52,623
I've decided that this year,

483
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,990
it should hang on your tree.

484
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,925
(applause)

485
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:58,094
Yes, please... (laughs)

486
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:02,498
What a triumph.

487
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:05,168
You've renewed these halls, Sister.

488
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,871
Even your tree shows imagination
and resourcefulness...

489
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,606
(gentle laugh)

490
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:13,276
...filled with the very icons
of their lives.

491
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:17,180
It reminds me of Marcel Duchamp
and the school

492
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,981
of found object art.

493
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,917
So clever and forward-thinking.

494
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,618
(whispers):
Just what's been missing.

495
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:25,021
(whispering):
Thank you, Monsignor.

496
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:26,856
I've had these ideas for a while.

497
00:23:26,924 --> 00:23:28,791
Oh, and Leigh Emerson.

498
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,493
Mm.

499
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:32,996
I must confess, I was more
than a little concerned

500
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,966
with your instincts to offer
him Christmas largesse.

501
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:38,135
Yes. But look at him.

502
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:39,636
A renewed soul.

503
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:42,205
What do you say, we blow this pop stand,

504
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:45,442
go savage a few elves and
then suck on each other, hmm?

505
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,377
MONSIGNOR: So, Arthur?

506
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,647
Monsignor.

507
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:54,285
There is a palpable spirit
of love and joy in this room.

508
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:58,155
What say we put aside
our... difficulties

509
00:23:58,223 --> 00:24:03,427
and celebrate
this successful transition?

510
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,096
Our young.

511
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:06,497
Sister Mary Eunice

512
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:09,501
is quite a treasure, isn't she?

513
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:13,472
That she is, more than
you can possibly imagine.

514
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,474
Frank, we need you up here, and, uh,

515
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,176
bring the ladder.

516
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:20,046
(Sister Mary Eunice sighs)

517
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:22,782
I want to hang this star

518
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,385
before the entertainment portion
of our party.

519
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:28,254
We are watching <i>Rudolph</i>
<i>the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i> tonight.

520
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:30,523

00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:48,308
I got a bun in that oven.

531
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:50,610
Really? I thought I was
just eating too much pie.

532
00:24:50,678 --> 00:24:52,145
Keep eating.

533
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:54,647
I want that kid
to pop out fat and happy.

534
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,216
What if it's a girl?

535
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:58,318
But it's not.

536
00:24:58,386 --> 00:24:59,953
Mm!

537
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,654
Mmm.

541
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,296
I just have a hunch.

542
00:25:10,364 --> 00:25:13,166
I want to teach this kid baseball.

543
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,701
And football.

544
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:15,936
And how to change a tire.

545
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:20,007
What? I can't teach him.

546
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:22,342
Grace. (Laughs)

547
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,744
What's this about?
I'm so sorry, Grace.

548
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,312
I should have stayed gone.

549
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,881
If I hadn't come back...

550
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:28,783
Shh. Who cares about that?

551
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:32,687
Dance with me.

552
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:41,763
LANA (whispers): <i>Kit...</i>

553
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,100
Kit, can you hear me?

554
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:51,539
They're saying you escaped custody.

555
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,608
I heard on the radio there's a manhunt.

556
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:56,144
The police are still looking for you.

557
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:00,315
Oh, God.

558
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:03,852
If they don't know you're here,

559
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,121
they don't know
what happened to me, either.

560
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,526
No one <i>is</i> coming for either of us.

561
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:14,529
And he's still out there.

562
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:17,364
Grace?

563
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:19,733
No, Kit.

564
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:23,070
It's Lana.
I haven't seen Grace.

565
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:25,305
I don't know where she is.

566
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:26,707
Dead.

567
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,342
What?

568
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,145
Grace is dead.

569
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:36,383
We have to get you out of here.

570
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:39,419
We <i>both</i> have to get out of here.

571
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,489
They've got you doped up.

572
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,361
I just have to get to a telephone.

573
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:49,729
I need to call the police.

574
00:26:49,797 --> 00:26:51,131
They're gonna fry me.

575
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:53,834
No. No one is going
to fry you, Kit.

576
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:57,038
You're innocent, and I can prove it.

577
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,441
It was Thredson.

578
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:01,775
What?

579
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:05,012
He murdered those women, not you.

580
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:08,582
He took me, Kit.

581
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,718
He showed me where he did it.

582
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:14,388
It was him.

583
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:18,692
That's why he got himself
appointed to your case...

584
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,695
to get you to confess to
crimes that he committed.

585
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,199
Did he hurt you?

586
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:29,204
They need to know.

587
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,741
They have to get there
before he does it again.

588
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:34,576
And before he destroys the evidence.

589
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:35,944
I have to get to the phone.

590
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:38,080
Lana...?

591
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:41,451
Are you really here?

592
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:44,062
I'm really here.

593
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,568
And I'm coming back.

594
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,772
You kept your word, Dr. Arden.

595
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,109
Where is Sister Mary Eunice now?

596
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:23,879
In the common room,
hosting a Christmas party.

597
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:27,382
She should be stopped,
for that reason alone.

598
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,751
You sure you don't need any help?

599
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,586
No. Only I can reach her.

600
00:28:31,654 --> 00:28:33,988
I just need time.

601
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:35,756
Bring her to my office.

602
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:38,092
Lock the door.

603
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,662
And don't let anyone interrupt us.

604
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,797
Consider it done.

605
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,367
I never thought I would see it.

606
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,803
What's that?

607
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:51,038
The day you and I would work together.

608
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:58,213
Coming through.

609
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:00,582
(crowd chatter)

610
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,888
Sister Mary Eunice, you
really have stepped out

611
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:07,723
from the shadow of Sister Jude,

612
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,092
shining brighter
than anyone could imagine.

613
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,860
Thank you, Monsignor.

614
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:14,329
Oh, if you could stay
just a little bit longer,

615
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:17,265
Frank is about to put
your star on the tree.

616
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,601
Oh, no, Sister,
like the mythical jolly old elf,

617
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:22,403
I, too, have more than one visit
on this festive night, but

618
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,739
I am happy and grateful

619
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:27,408
to leave Briarcliff
in your capable hands.

620
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:30,645
Okay, hand me the star.

621
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:38,052
Oh!

622
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,687

623
00:29:39,754 --> 00:29:43,357

624
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,626
MAN: Get down!

625
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:48,730
(grunting)

626
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,266
Two steps forward, one step back.

627
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,467
(grunting)

628
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,435
Frank, you all right?

629
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,636
Yeah. I'm fine.

630
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:56,837
Can you take him to solitary?

631
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:57,938
I'd be glad to.

632
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:00,307
(grunts)

633
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,708
Get him up.

634
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:03,277
Turn him around.

635
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,047
FRANK: All right.

636
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:11,018
Sister Mary Eunice,
there's a pressing matter

637
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:13,854
in your office that
needs your attention.

638
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,361
(door creaks softly)

639
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,378
Hope you're not planning
on making a toll call.

640
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,218
Hey, Frankie, what about the outfit?

641
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:48,588
Sister's instructions were just
to throw you back in your hole.

642
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:51,624
Do not open until the next
Christmas after never.

643
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:55,494
Go rot in there, you bastard.

644
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,862
He give you any trouble?

645
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,365
No, Sister. Oh...

646
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:01,167
(whispers): I think he did.

647
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,208
(sighs)

648
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:13,411
Now...

649
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,947
how did this get in the building?

650
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:19,951
I pray we're not looking at a rampage.

651
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:21,386
(wheezing laugh)

652
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,624

654
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:44,384
What are you doing here?

655
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:47,145
I'm here to open my present.

657

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,181

SISTER JUDE:
Dr. Arden, open this door!

00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,232
She <i>really</i>

666
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,734
doesn't like you.
What's this all about?

667
00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:40,037
You left me in that hole to rot.

668
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:41,205
But you're out now.

669
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:42,873
Anything is possible.

670
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:46,542
Let me pray with you.
I think I'd rather tell you

671
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:47,983
about my fantasies,

672
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,565
like the one where I jam

673
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:52,394
this gigantic crucifix
up your ass, or the other one

674
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:55,056
where I take my rotting teeth

675
00:32:55,124 --> 00:32:57,726
and my foul-breathed mouth

676
00:32:57,793 --> 00:32:59,527
and chomp down

677
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,763
on your dried-up...

678
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,198
Help me! Please!

679
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:04,365
Oh, Sister, where's your sense

680
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:05,667
of Christmas spirit?

681
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,001
I'm just beginning

682
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,304
to feel the comfort and joy!

683
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:10,973
SISTER JUDE: Help me!

684
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,674
Dear God, someone help me!

685
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,243
Anyone, help me!

686
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,479
Does this offend
your delicate sensibilities?

687
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,918
Actually, I find it rather tedious.

688
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:23,853
Now, if you'll excuse me,

689
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:27,923
I have more pressing
matters to take care of.

690
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:29,858
(sighs softly)

691
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,496
How did you find me?
Well, you were

692
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:36,230
in a car accident, Lana.

693
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:37,832
The details were in all the papers.

694
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:41,002
"Escaped mental patient returned

695
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,670
to ward."

696
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,105
You'll never get away with it,

697
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:45,940
not as long as I have a voice.

698
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,641
Is that what you were doing
on the phone?

699
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:49,243
You were going to call the police?

700
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,945
You know what I've been
doing since you left me?

701
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,881
I've been mourning.

702
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,585
You made me kill Bloody Face.

703
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,454
I've been through every inch

704
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,691
of my house with a toothbrush
cleaning up... no...

705
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,059
bone, no...

706
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,395
skin, no... drop
of blood escaped

707
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:07,963
my scrutiny, and the furnace

708
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,831
has been burning red-hot,
believe me.

709
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,233
You haven't made me disappear.

710
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,334
I'm a witness.

711
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:13,468
To the courts?

712
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:16,004
An unreliable one at best.

713
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:18,407
In fact, I <i>was</i> just gonna let you talk.

714
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:20,743
With no hard evidence, who
do you think they'll believe,

715
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,878
the doctor or the patient?
But then I thought

716
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:24,213
about how you betrayed me.

717
00:34:25,716 --> 00:34:27,684
I opened my heart to you,

718
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,586
I told you my story,

719
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:31,054
and you used it to confuse me.

720
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:32,856
You made me give you

721
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:35,092
my intimacy, and that is a wrong

722
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,227
that I need to make right.

723
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:39,096
You're insane.

724
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,500
Everyone is gonna be able to see that.

725
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:44,802
I've lost so much recently, I feel like

726
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,205
I've been set adrift in
the open sea... but now...

727
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:50,074
that you're here...

728
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:53,110
so close to me again, well...

729
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,513
I feel like I've been found.

730
00:34:56,581 --> 00:34:59,249
(Lana gasping)

731
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:01,285
(crying)

732
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:03,821
(muffled shout) Shh.

733
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:08,960
Do you believe in fate, Lana?

734
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,796
Hmm? (Muffled sobbing)

735
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:14,699
We've been drawn together like
magnets, and I must admit

736
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:16,801
I didn't fully understand why until now.

737
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:19,837
But like the Phoenix,
who had to turn to ashes...

738
00:35:19,905 --> 00:35:23,474
Bloody Face had to burn
so he could be born again.

739
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:27,813
And your skin...

740
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,316
will be the start of a
whole new Bloody Face.

741
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:33,819
(Lana wails)

742
00:35:33,887 --> 00:35:35,955
(gasping)

743
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,161
(panting)

744
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:42,563
LEIGH: <i>It's just you</i>

745
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:43,998
and me, Sister. God's off

746
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,033
having schnapps with the nice Santa.

747
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:47,235
I'm not the enemy.

748
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:49,704
You're not the <i>only</i> enemy,

749
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:51,906
you just happen to be the one
I'm focusing on right now.

750
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:52,906
Whee!

751
00:35:56,478 --> 00:35:58,946
("Carol of the Bells" playing)

752
00:35:59,014 --> 00:35:59,980
(cane striking) (gasps, groans)

753
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:03,484
I take that back.

754
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,953
Maybe God <i>is</i> here,

755
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:07,622
and...

756
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,524
he's giving me a sign.

757
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:12,928
("Carol of the Bells" continues)

758
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,099
(quietly): Oh, yeah.

759
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:20,068
Yeah...

760
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,771
My welts never healed.
(groaning)

761
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:24,306
No sunlight,

762
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,374
no medicine, no bathing,

763
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:27,743
and you never, (Sister Jude grunts)

764
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,645
ever checked on me!

765
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:30,812
Not once!

766
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,948
They're putrid now.

767
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:34,917
They're seeping pus.

768
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,020
Maybe I'll have you lick them
after I'm done, huh?

769
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:39,521
(Sister Jude groans)

770
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:42,391
Remember what you said? Huh?

771
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,026
SISTER JUDE:
<i>We're going to soften you up</i>

772
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:45,995
so God doesn't have to work so hard

773
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:47,596
to enter you with His light.

774
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:48,330
(cane striking)

775
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:49,331
Guess what?

776
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:52,134
There is no God.

777
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,168
(whimpers)

778
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:54,603
But there is a Santa Claus.

779
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,604
(cane striking)

780
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,871
We have to kill him.

781
00:36:58,641 --> 00:36:59,774
(groans)

782
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,075
Wait, wait, wait a second...

783
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:03,345
Wait a second... stop it...

784
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,213
Stop!
You have to let me do this.

785
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:07,849
We need him.

786
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:10,051
He's the only thing standing between me

787
00:37:10,118 --> 00:37:11,085
and the electric chair.

788
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,227
Why is there still a manhunt?

789
00:37:20,764 --> 00:37:23,065
Why haven't they turned you in?

790
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,984
(loud, harsh buzzing)

791
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:45,923
(groaning)

792
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:48,793
(gasping, groaning)

793
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:51,428
(beep)

794
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:53,998
(buzzing stops)

795
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,369
("Carol of the Bells" fades in)

796
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:00,371
(gasping)

797
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:02,006
Are we having fun yet?

798
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:04,375
Have you softened up enough
to receive the light?

799
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:08,379
Except it won't be God...

800
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:10,815
and, actually, it won't be light.

801
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,020
(cane strikes, Sister Jude gasps)

802
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:16,887
LEIGH: Again!

803
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,194
(Leigh groans)

804
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:30,501
(gasps, groans weakly)

805
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:32,870
("Carol of the Bells" continuing)

806
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:38,775
This isn't going to work forever.

807
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:40,744
Look at the dust...
it's a junk room.

808
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:43,146
They practically never come in here.

809
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:45,916
But you're right... we'll have
to think of something.

810
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,518
I'll finish.

811
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,387
Get back to the infirmary
before they realize you're gone.

812
00:38:57,162 --> 00:38:59,230
One day, I'll bury you.
