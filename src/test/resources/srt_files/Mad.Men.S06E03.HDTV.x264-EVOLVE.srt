00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,240
Can I get you something to eat?

164
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,677
I think I have some peanuts
and some cheese crackers.

165
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,812
No, thank you.

166
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,780
Perhaps something to drink?

167
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,449
I have bourbon, vodka,

168
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,384
gin, champagne.

169
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,353
I shouldn't.
I started on the train.

170
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:17,422
( laughs ) What kind
of music do you like?

171
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,558
None for me.

172
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,262
Is the temperature okay?

173
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,900
Yes.

174
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,135
Hmm.

175
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,872
It's been known to get hot.

176
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:37,274
I'm fine.

177
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,243
That's a pretty shade
of lipstick.

178
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,579
Thank you.

179
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:49,186
I'm glad you came.

180
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:10,373
Come with me.

181
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:21,616
DDB managed to get me
on the 50-yard line

182
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,118
for the Giants game
last November.

183
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:25,654
If we'd done it,
the Steelers would have won.

184
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:28,722
- ( laughs )
- We'd do anything to make you happy.

185
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:30,858
I'm not unhappy with DDB.

186
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:32,793
No notes.

187
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:35,596
When I presented the numbers
for my division,

188
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,400
Timmy came up to me and said,
"How the hell did you do that?"

189
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,502
So I figured he's in town,

190
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:44,137
why not take him
to the horse's mouth?

191
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,838
The past few years,

192
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,108
I've overseen ketchup
to great success.

193
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,310
But how long before
we're old news?

194
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:53,580
And, hell, when I saw baked beans
have a sales spike like that...

195
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:56,149
Raymond has demanded
our best work.

196
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:58,918
So then the question is
what can we do for you?

197
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:00,519
What can we do for ketchup?

198
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,055
Let me know.

199
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,860
A pleasure to meet you, Timmy.

200
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,296
This isn't an official visit.

201
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,498
I'm just dropping by.

202
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,866
Ken, Don and I have a little beans
housekeeping, if you don't mind.

203
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,570
I'd love to walk you out.

204
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,175
Raymond, we're grateful
for this opportunity

205
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,611
and consider it
quite a vote of confidence.

206
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,481
It is, but I don't want you
to waste your time.

207
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,950
Well, then if nothing else,
we appreciate the introduction.

208
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,452
I'm not winking here.

209
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,554
There is to be
no further communication

210
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,523
with Timmy or his division.

211
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,992
I'm sorry, Raymond. Did we
do something to upset you?

212
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,628
You guys are doing
a bang-up job.

213
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,396
And now that polished Polack
wants the same.

214
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,265
I'll take that drink.

215
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:53,169
No one's paid attention to me
in nine years at the company.

216
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:55,104
They gave me a suicide mission.

217
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,740
Vinegar, sauces,
and baked beans.

218
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:00,276
And then in my moment
of triumph, he comes up to me

219
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,178
and he didn't say,
"How did you do that?"

220
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,878
He said,
"How did <i>you</i> do <i>that?"</i>

221
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:06,348
<i>Smug bastard.</i>

222
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:07,915
I taught him
everything he knows.

223
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,918
- We understand, Raymond.
- No, forget it.

224
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:13,522
I know ketchup's
the gold standard,

225
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:16,324
but after all we've been through,
I'm sure I don't need to tell you

226
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,627
that if you so much as send
him a ham at Christmas,

227
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:23,197
well, I'd rather retire

228
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:25,499
than watch that guy
screw my girlfriend.

229
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,802
- Let me walk you out.
- No.

230
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,971
If he lingered at all,

231
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm gonna pretend I'm on
my way to the men's room.

232
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,245
I'm sorry.
What a waste of time.

233
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,047
I don't know.
We met Timmy.

234
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,916
- He's certainly going places.
- Raymond's so weak.

235
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,986
But he brought his business here
when we were barely standing.

236
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,455
It's Heinz Ketchup, Don.

237
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,956
It's the Coca-Cola
of condiments.

238
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,792
I know.

239
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:56,595
But sometimes you've got to dance
with the one that brung ya.

240
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,702
I'm afraid that's the end
of your toilet paper.

241
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:06,405
This place could really use
a woman's touch.

242
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,138
You think so?

243
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,474
I might come to town Friday.

244
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,710
There's always
a sale at Macy's.

245
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:14,745
We'll see.

246
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,482
Okay, I'll call you.

247
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:21,452
If I let the phone ring once and
hang up, then you'll know it's me.

248
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,120
Don't do that.

249
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,889
Well, I'm going to park my car

250
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,425
in front of the driveway
instead of in the driveway.

251
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,493
Then you'll know
I'm thinking of you.

252
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,735
That's sweet.

253
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,402
I really have to get back.

254
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:41,403
Can you move it along a little?

255
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,597
You told me you were
washing these by hand.

256
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,466
- No wonder the elastic is shot.
- I forgot.

257
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,301
And you forgot you left
the vacuum on the terrace.

258
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:52,802
I was changing the bag.

259
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:55,372
And you forgot not to use
S.O.S on the Teflon.

260
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:57,241
I mean, I leave
for work every day

261
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,476
and I wonder what you're
going to ruin in my house.

262
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,246
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Draper.

263
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,448
( sighs )

264
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:08,284
I don't know how to do
this, but you're fired.

265
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:12,021
I'll get my things.

266
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,361
- I'm sorry.
- No.

267
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,463
I am. I walked in on it and
then I didn't want to pretend.

268
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:23,598
( crying )

269
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,601
Are you okay, honey?

270
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,603
No.

271
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:36,044
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.

272
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,019
I don't wanna go
up until she's gone.

273
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,637
Let her alone
with your silverware?

274
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,718
So, after weeks, I finally showed him
the picture of my mother...

275
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:48,755
but that's not enough, because
her name has been changed in the will.

276
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,092
That is quite a story line.

277
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:53,693
Well, you asked.

278
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:56,563
- It's meaty, isn't it?
- It is.

279
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,431
I just wish watching TV
during the day

280
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,633
didn't make me feel so guilty.

281
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,306
I had a miscarriage.

282
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,408
All right.
I will watch.

283
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:10,942
( chuckles )

284
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:13,945
No, in real life.

285
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:16,094
Two days ago.

286
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,489
I'm so sorry to hear that.

287
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:26,124
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
burden you with this.

288
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:28,959
No, you obviously need to talk.

289
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:33,864
I was sloppy
in Hawaii--

290
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:37,968
the time difference, vacation.

291
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:41,972
Now I feel so guilty.

292
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:44,574
May I?

293
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:49,178
What do you have
to feel guilty about?

294
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,153
What did Don say?

295
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:01,257
I didn't tell him.

296
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,558
It's been a hard
couple of weeks.

297
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:06,795
Oh.

298
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,665
I don't know why.

299
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,701
I mean, I do.

300
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,806
You were raised
the same way I was.

301
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,408
I keep hearing
Sister Eugenie in my head.

302
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,878
I'm such a horrible person.

303
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:29,116
You're not a horrible person.

304
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,485
No, I am.

305
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,955
I mean,

306
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,291
to be pregnant now

307
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,326
at this moment?

308
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,730
I didn't know
what I wanted to do

309
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:47,067
and I was so relieved that I
didn't have to do anything.

310
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,969
I see.

311
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,605
Has this ever happened to you?

312
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,043
About a year after
I had Mitchell.

313
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,281
So I certainly understand
some of what you're feeling.

314
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,686
But the rest of it,

315
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,421
no.

316
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:11,989
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,325
Really?

318
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,927
Because I was raised
the same way,

319
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,031
so I would never even
consider that my decision.

320
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,466
You really believe that?

321
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,667
I do.

322
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,303
And I think you do, too,

323
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,106
or you wouldn't feel this way.

324
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,411
I just feel so shitty.

325
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,848
I'm sorry I brought it up.

326
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:42,251
<i>( door opens )</i>

327
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,422
Hello.

328
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:50,059
Hello.

329
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,062
- Sylvia's here.
- I see that.

330
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,429
Hello.

331
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,739
I should be going.

332
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:08,276
You don't have to rush off.

333
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,678
- <i>Have a drink.</i>
- No, I'll leave you two alone.

334
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:19,987
- I fired the maid today.
- Good riddance.

335
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,889
Good night, both of you.

336
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:23,590
See you tomorrow.

337
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:26,426
- Excuse me?
- For dinner.

338
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,262
Oh, of course.

339
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,496
Yes.

340
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,564
<i>( door closes )</i>

341
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:49,514
So send her in.

342
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:51,950
Sorry to bother you,
but this was on my desk.

343
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,484
Is it new?

344
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,120
There's usually a memo
for everything around here.

345
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,322
- What is it?
- It's Quest.

346
00:19:57,356 --> 00:20:01,192
Feminine hygiene powder.

347
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:03,727
- Did I miss a meeting?
- "Proof points--

nicer if you're stinky,

350
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:12,303
( laughs )

351
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,239
"Target-- professional
women and other Olsons."

352
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,208
Just give it to me.

353
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:19,810
Calm down.

354
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,545
I think this is somebody's
idea of a joke.

355
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,814
Of course, when you want them
to be funny they're useless.

356
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:31,487
Hello, gorgeous.

357
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:36,826
Hello, Herb.

358
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:40,128
Did you get
all gussied up for me?

359
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,831
No.

360
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,467
I had no idea you'd be
darkening my doorway.

361
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:47,435
When are you gonna
come out to the lot?

362
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,505
I told you, I'll let you have a
Jaguar for as long as you like.

363
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,240
I take the bus.

364
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:55,343
I know there's a part of you
that's glad to see me.

365
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:58,780
And I know there's a part of
you you haven't seen in years.

366
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,249
Herb!
There you are.

367
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,884
How are you today?

368
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,718
Toodle-oo.

369
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:11,592
Dawn on intercom: <i>Mrs. Harris
is here to see you.</i>

370
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:13,527
He's here.

371
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:37,148
Thank you.

372
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:39,384
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob Benson.

373
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,420
We've met before.
I'm part of the team.

374
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:44,923
Doesn't the elevator
go up to this floor?

375
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:46,157
<i>( door opens )</i>

376
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,026
Herb.

377
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,628
What brings you by?

378
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:52,362
I had some thoughts,
the complexity of which

379
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:54,197
could not be expressed
over a telephone.

380
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,766
What is it you want?

381
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:58,469
Well, you guys are gonna
make some fancy-schmancy

382
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:00,538
Michelangelo TV spot
and the dealers

383
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:02,272
are gonna foot most of
the bill for running it.

384
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,241
That's how it works.

385
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:07,077
Well, I'm the only guy actually
out there selling hamburgers

386
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:10,313
and I want people to know there's
a hamburger store in Englewood,

387
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:12,782
not England or in your mind.

388
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:16,018
I don't want another thing with some
shmuck sitting on his lawn mower

389
00:22:16,053 --> 00:22:19,556
fantasizing that he's gonna win
the Grand Prix driving a Jaguar.

390
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,357
I need foot traffic.

391
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,225
Get 'em in the door
so I can move metal.

392
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,595
Well, you, along with
the factory guys,

393
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,264
have already signed off on
the work as well as the buy.

394
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:32,400
I just think there should
be retail radio as well.

395
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,737
You know? "Does your
car sound like this?"

396
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,507
Voom voom! "Does your
wife sound like this?"

397
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,107
"Ooh, I love your car."

398
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,977
And then you say
the phone number twice.

399
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,612
Wonderful.

400
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,881
We'd love to increase
the exposure of the campaign.

401
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,516
How much more
would you like to buy?

402
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,487
There's no increase.
Just adjust the proportions.

403
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,622
I think we should spend
60% of the money

404
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,791
on local dealership ads
instead of national.

405
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:01,595
Herb, that would really take a
bite out of the national campaign.

406
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:03,797
Well, if you say so.

407
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:06,199
Unfortunately,
it's not up to me,

408
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,334
so I am suggesting

409
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,471
that you recommend
this plan to all of us.

410
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:13,772
Why don't you recommend it?
It's your idea.

411
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:17,175
Because it's an idea
you had yourself.

412
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:21,747
And Lord knows
you're so damn persuasive.

413
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:24,016
We understand, Herb.

414
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,018
See how easy that was, Bob?

415
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,690
Bob, why don't you
show me the sights?

416
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:35,527
You must be like a kid
in a candy store around here.

417
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,534
- You can't shake his hand?
- He didn't seem interested.

418
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:46,737
In fact, the only thing he seemed interested
in was gutting our national campaign.

419
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:49,439
You do realize that defeats
the purpose of having Jaguar?

420
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:51,875
So he's demanding
and unreasonable.

421
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,378
How does that make him different from the
other people who walk through that door?

422
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:58,415
I wish you would handle the clients
as well as you're handling me.

Okay?

00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:30,804
Well, that was bound to happen.

434
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:34,274
You worked for me
and you like me.

435
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:37,411
- I worked with you.
- I was tough but fair.

<i>Oh, speaking of people</i>
<i>who hate you,</i>

437

<i>Raymond J. Beans came in today</i>
<i>and pulled a real boner.</i>

438
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,015
Go on.

439
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,483
He brought in
the head of ketchup.

440
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,752
He's obsessed with that man.

441
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,254
Yeah, he should be.
I met him.

442
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,323
So Raymond makes
the introduction

443
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:53,192
and then, according to Ken, ketchup
leaves, but Raymond lingers

444
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:55,527
and he says he's gonna
kill the account and himself

445
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,161
if they even talk
to ketchup again.

446
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,197
Why'd he bring him in?

447
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,500
Because he's Raymond.
He's a fraidycat.

448
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,470
And-- here's the part
that's gonna make you happy--

449
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,872
Kenny spent two weeks
telling everybody

450
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,407
how he was getting ketchup.

451
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,875
( laughing )

452
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,080
Okay, Tuesday morning
is perfect.

453
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,650
<i>What? Oh, yep.</i>

454
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,018
<i>We'll have your wig</i>
<i>ready then, ma'am.</i>

455
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,857
You're allowed to make
personal calls after 5:00,

456
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:28,424
especially if they
make you laugh.

457
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,826
My friend Stan was
telling me a funny story

458
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:33,429
- about one of our old clients.
- What happened?

459
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:37,233
Oh, it's complicated, but basically
the guy from Heinz Baked Beans

460
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:38,801
hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.

461
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:40,370
Of course he does.

462
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:43,305
Well, surprisingly,
beans brought ketchup in

463
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,707
for a meeting at the agency
and everyone got excited,

464
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:49,077
and then unsurprisingly
he sent ketchup out of the room

465
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:50,679
and told everyone
it was just for show.

466
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,781
So he's unhappy?

467
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:55,183
He's not going anywhere.

468
00:25:55,217 --> 00:25:56,885
Probably misses you.

469
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,553
( laughs ) No.

470
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:00,488
I assure you, he doesn't.

471
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:06,160
There's nothing like things going
badly when you leave, is there?

472
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,366
Sorry I'm late.

473
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,234
3rd Avenue was a parking lot.

474
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:18,438
I'm not feeling well.

475
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,410
That's not where it hurts.

476
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:25,512
Oh.
Did you cancel?

477
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:28,648
No, I thought I'd feel better
by the time you got home.

478
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:30,850
We're supposed to be there

I know, but I don't
want to pretend

- I want you to go.

I want you to have fun.

Okay.

485

But you go right to bed.

486
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,137
Yes, sir.

I'm sorry. I didn't

- Close the door.

We had a terrible fight.

- No, please.

502
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:48,390
Well, then I'm taking you
to the hospital.

503

- I'll be fine.
- No, what do you think you're doing?

You're not going back there.
Peter, go to Tammy's bathroom.

There's some cotton wool.

506

I'll be right back.

507
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:03,069
I hope you haven't
been waiting long.

508
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:05,071
Oh, don't worry about it.
I was late, too.

509
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:07,607
They already gave us
a hard time.

510
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:09,842
- Where's your wife? - She sends her
regrets. She wasn't feeling well.

511
00:28:09,877 --> 00:28:12,745
- That's too bad.
- You look lovely.

512
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,014
Let's get you a drink.

We'll get the waiter
to do the whole show again.

514

I'm afraid there's only
going to be three of us.

- Don?
- Old-fashioned, please.

<i>Subito.</i>

517
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,792
Well, the North Koreans
really took that ship.

518
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:29,093
And the Vietcong, did you see
them storming the embassy?

519
00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:30,995
I haven't followed it today.

520
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,997
- We got it back.
- Still...

521
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:35,300
these two little pissant countries
handing our head to us.

522
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:37,736
Well, I don't know
about the ship,

523
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,438
but from what I've read, the embassy was
an ambush that broke the cease-fire.

524
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:42,973
We gave them peace
for their sacred holiday.

525
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:46,410
Next thing we know,
they cut us to ribbons.

526
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:47,912
Reminds me of Cuba.

527
00:28:47,946 --> 00:28:50,314
No one took
Fidel Castro seriously.

528
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,282
We thought he was Señor Wences.

529
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:54,518
Turns out he was
George Washington.

530
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:57,487
And they say surgeons
are arrogant.

531
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:58,988
Who says that?

532
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:01,458
You know we're losing the war.

533
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:05,562
Wouldn't know it
from looking around here.

534
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:08,064
Yeah, it's something, right?

535
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:11,434
- You are Dr. Rosen?
- You see this service?

536
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:14,002
Yes. We'd like to hear
the spiel again.

537
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:16,839
Uh, <i>scusi.</i>
There is a telephone call.

00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,976
I'll be right back.

540

My mother's in Boca Raton.

546
00:29:57,044 --> 00:30:00,813
Well, you can't go home.
We should find a hotel.

Hello? Yes.

550
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,164
Do you have any
vacancies this evening?

551
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:22,834
Take me to the city.
I want to be with you.

552
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,503
Absolutely not.

553
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:28,105
Very good.
Thank you.

554
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,542

- We'll get you a taxi.

556

Nonsense.
I'll drive you.

557
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:38,481
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'll run you over.

558

Brenda, dear, let's go.
It's best this way.

Unfortunately, no.

- This is silly.
- We can do this another time.

I'm not taking my foot out of
the door of this restaurant.

What are you having?

00:31:16,722 --> 00:31:18,755
I don't know
that I'm that hungry.

568
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:23,627
You want another glass of wine?
Should we get a bottle?

569
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:25,662
You're drinking something else.

570
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,964
I don't want you to have wine
if you don't drink wine.

571
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,833
I'm not gonna drink
a whole bottle, obviously.

572
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,402
I don't know
how obvious that is.

573
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,403
Another glass is fine.

574
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:37,573
So what looks good here?

575
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:40,409
Depends what you want.

576
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:43,579
Well, I'm hungry,
I'm in a good mood,

577
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:47,650
and I'd like some guidance on the
Italian menu from my favorite Italian.

578
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:50,819
I didn't cook it, so I can't
speak to its quality.

579

You think I'd like
eggplant rollatinis?

For the lovely signora?

581

- We're not ready yet.
- Yes, we are.

582
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,296
Can she have
another glass of wine

583
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:03,765

<i>Certo.</i>

How could I possibly know
what you like to eat?

I thought you were
looking forward to this.

588
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,278
I don't know what we're doing.

We're having dinner together.

590
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:23,282
And I'm sorry, but I guess
it was a stupid idea to think

591
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,118
we could spend time together
outside of your maid's room.

592

Just because they cleared
their place settings

That everything
worked out perfectly?

And you enjoy how foolish
they both look.

Now I understand.

598
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:47,171
You want to feel shitty

right up until the point
where I take your dress off.

600

Because I'm going to do that.

601

You want to skip dinner?
Fine. But don't pretend.

00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,863
So stay with us.
We'll return in 15 minutes

636
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,931
with our guest
Mr. Garrison.

637
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:05,200
<i>( door opens )</i>

638
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:30,158
Did you have fun?

639
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:31,993
Arnold had an emergency,

640
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,661
so Sylvia and I
had to eat enough

641
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:36,797
to keep him
in good graces there.

642
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,799
Are you feeling better?

643
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,469
I need to talk to you.

644
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:50,409
What's wrong?

645
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:52,244
Um...

646
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:57,216
Well, I had a miscarriage

647
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,318
a few days ago.

648
00:36:07,326 --> 00:36:09,127
Are you okay?

649
00:36:09,162 --> 00:36:10,862
Did you go to the doctor?

650
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,898
Yes.

651
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,866
How far along were you?

652
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:16,534
Six weeks.

653
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,405
I wish you would have told me.

654
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:25,776
I guess I didn't know
how you'd feel.

655
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,644
I didn't know what you'd want.

656
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:33,217
Megan, you have to know
I'd want what you want.

657
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:35,686
Is that what you want?

658
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:38,621
Of course it is.

659
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,657
But I don't know that it's even

660
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:45,128
the right time to have
a conversation about it.

661
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,997
And I guess that's why
I didn't tell you.

662
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,701
But I should have.

663
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:54,002
Yes, you should have.

664
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,775
Do you want to have
that conversation?

665
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,611
Whatever you want.

666
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,019
Now I can go to sleep.

667
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:20,361
Good morning.

668
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:27,400
- Where's Tammy?
- Leticia took her to the park.

669
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,369
Oh.

670
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:32,472
Well, I'm off.

671
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:35,441
Couldn't you just pretend?

672
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:39,880
I let you have that apartment.

673
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:43,015
Somehow I thought
that there was some dignity

674
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,117
in granting permission.

675
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:48,387
All I wanted was
for you to be discreet.

676
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:49,922
She lives on our block!

677
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:52,324
Trudy, don't jump
to conclusions.

678
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:54,760
There's no way
for me to escape.

679
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,962
To not be an object of pity

680
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:59,397
while you get to do
whatever you feel like.

681
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,232
I have never said no to you.

682
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:04,068
That is not true.
What are we doing out here?

683
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:07,438
We're done, Peter.
This is over.

684
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:09,107
You want a divorce?

685
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:11,342
I refuse to be a failure.

686
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,278
I don't care
what you want anymore.

687
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:15,045
This is how it's going to work.

688
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,615
You will be here only when
I tell you to be here.

689
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,818
I'm drawing a 50-mile
radius around this house

690
00:38:20,852 --> 00:38:24,788
and if you so much as open your fly
to urinate, I will destroy you.

691
00:38:24,822 --> 00:38:26,756
Do you understand?

692
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:30,059
You know what?

693
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:32,261
You're going to go
to bed alone tonight

694
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:35,398
and you're going to realize you
don't know anything for sure.

695
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:38,166
I'll live with that.

696
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,044
<i>( door slams )</i>

697
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,147
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

698
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:54,248
So far this is all we have,

699
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,884
but I want you to find out
everything you can on Heinz Ketchup.

700
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,686
What?

701
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:00,588
And this is not a joke.

702
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,026
No.
I can't do that.

703
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:07,228
Why not?

704
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,196
It's a little bit of a secret,

705
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,797
but it turns out
they're taking meetings.

706
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:13,166
I told you that secret
and I shouldn't have.

707
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,935
Look, everybody's gonna know.
We just know a little sooner.

708
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,538
My friend told me that
in confidence.

709
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,306
He's not your friend.

710
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:22,242
- He's the enemy.
- Well, he doesn't know that.

711
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,111
Maybe you need a friend
more than you need a job.

712
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:26,912
I didn't know that.
I'm in advertising.

713
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,914
It's not that.

714
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:31,149
It's just that it was
a private conversation.

715
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:34,219
What are you, his priest?
This is how wars are won.

716
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,822
Your friend's mistake
was underestimating you.

717
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:43,728
I hope ketchup makes the same
mistake so you can blow their mind.

718
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,144
Herb: <i>So, correct me</i>
<i>if I'm wrong, Pete.</i>

719
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:54,846
I certainly will.

720
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,614
You're suggesting
that we forego

721
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:58,682
this sparkling
national ad campaign

722
00:39:58,716 --> 00:40:02,719
in favor of hard-driving sales
ads at the local dealer level?

723
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:05,622
Not exactly. We will still
have a national presence

724
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:08,358
with the sophisticated work that
Don presented and you loved,

725
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:11,929
but we will increase
sales with a surgical

726
00:40:11,963 --> 00:40:14,764
and financial focus
on local media.

727
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:17,567
Well, that sounds good to me. Of
course, I'm a little bit biased.

728
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,569
Why would we do that?

729
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:23,072
We feel it's best to have a
plan that creates customers,

730
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,707
not just aficionados.

731
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:27,944
Don, are you really in favor

732
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,579
of throwing
our emphasis into radio?

733
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:31,813
Well, it's hard to argue

734
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:34,048
with a more direct appeal
to customers.

735
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,250
I mean, we can artsy up
the image of Jaguar,

736
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:40,455
make it look romantic
and stylish,

737
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,124
but isn't it better
to tell people

738
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,093
who are actually
in the market for a car

739
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:46,927
that a Jaguar is available?

740
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:51,231
I think
it's an exciting new angle

741
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:53,433
to use direct sales
on a luxury vehicle.

742
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,903
I mean, forget about radio.

743
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:57,905
How about a mailer

744
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,640
or a circular
in the Sunday paper?

745
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:02,509
I don't know if that's
what we had in mind.

746
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,812
So this is your recommendation?

747
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:08,948
I think it's better to

748
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,450
think about someone
in New Jersey

749
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,452
driving in their current car

750
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,354
and hearing that
right around the corner

751
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,224
there's a Jaguar to buy
at a low, low price.

752
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:21,927
I bet the numbers would support
that don't they, Harry?

753
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:24,596
That...

754
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:26,698
is really a statistics game.

755
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,967
You know what?
I will have to double-check.

756
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:31,269
Look, why are you
limiting yourself?

757
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:33,271
Wouldn't you rather
cast a wide net

758
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:36,507
so you can sell Jaguar
to the average guy?

759
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,510
You know, truck drivers,
housewives.

760
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:42,013
John: <i>I was under the impression
from the work you showed us</i>

761
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,214
<i>that this would be</i>
<i>a more elegant approach</i>

762
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:48,019
that made the Jaguar seem rare
because, let's face it,

763
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:52,022
the gentleman who buys our car
needs to be of some means.

764
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:55,324
I am 100% positive

765
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,661
that this approach moves cars.

766
00:41:57,695 --> 00:42:00,830
And not just Jaguars. This is
proven to move all kinds of cars.

767
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,999
Hell, even used cars.
Am I wrong, Herb?

768
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:06,335
No, he's right.
It moves cars.

769
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:10,372
Gentlemen, we appreciate
the recommendation,

770
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:12,908
but we believe we should
stay with the proposal

771
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:14,376
<i>as first discussed.</i>

772
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,745
And as persuasive
as these arguments were,

773
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,049
that is how we will
continue to proceed.

774
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,817
Let's not be too hasty.
Maybe we should listen to them.

775
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:24,852
At least give it some thought.

776
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:26,688
Herb's right.

777
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,824
We still believe this is our
best chance for success.

778
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:31,893
Fellas, this is gonna work.

779
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:35,029
I'm sorry, but this is
our final decision.

780
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:37,065
Thank you very much.

781
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:53,714
What the hell was that?

782
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:55,715
Herb, we couldn't
have pushed any harder.

783
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:58,084
You pushed,
then you let Don talk.

784
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,286
You should know better.
The guy's not a salesman.

785
00:43:02,022 --> 00:43:05,125
That was the deftest
self-immolation I've ever seen.

786
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,826
I don't know what
you're talking about.

787
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,794
I didn't know you were
capable of being that bad.

788
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:11,597
- What was that in there?
- I wasn't feeling well.

789
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,465
Something about that guy
makes me sick.

790
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,335
Don't be cute. I still
have his spit in my hair.

791
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,137
Why can't you
just follow the rules?

792
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:20,139
I did. I did exactly
what he asked for.

793
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:22,974
Not in spirit. You know damn
well that is not what he wanted.

794
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,309
Why do we care
what that guy wants?

795
00:43:24,344 --> 00:43:26,478
- Because he's a client.
- Our client.

796
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:29,447
And so we just keep
saying yes no matter what

797
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,449
because we didn't say no
to begin with?

798
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,117
You know what this is?
It's Munich.

799
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,619
You guys are always
talking about Munich.

800
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,387
What the hell
does that mean anyway?

801
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:38,222
It means we gave the Germans
whatever they wanted

802
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:40,658
to make them happy, but it
just made them want more.

803
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:42,660
Well, who the hell won the war?

804
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,535
As my mother used to say,

805
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:54,037
your options were
dishonor or war.

806
00:43:54,071 --> 00:43:56,306
You chose dishonor,
you might still get war.

807
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,574
That was Churchill.

808
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:04,713
- ( vacuum humming )
- ( knocks )

809
00:44:04,747 --> 00:44:06,414
First one in, last one out.

810
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:07,848
I don't know how you do it.

811
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:10,351
Me either.

812
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:13,854
Well, it can't be that bad when
you're doing something that you love.

813
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:16,291
I'm glad it looks
like that to you.

814
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:22,829
I spent a year in finance

815
00:44:22,863 --> 00:44:26,166
watching identical men
in identical suits

816
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:27,901
sneak drinks out
of a desk drawer

817
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:29,436
while counting
other people's money.

818
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,071
What house?

819
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,707
My family's been at
Brown Brothers Harriman

820
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:36,076
for three generations.

821
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,377
You make this
look a lot better.

822
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:41,347
It's all about what it
looks like, isn't it?

823
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:43,782
I'm going down to the deli.

824
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,284
Can I get you something?

825
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:47,220
No, thank you.

826
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,690
Bob.

827
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,259
My wife asked me
and I seem to have forgotten.

828
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:56,261
Could you pick me up
some toilet paper?

829
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:58,129
I got it, chief.

830
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:07,739
( sighs )

831
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:09,841
( knocking lightly )

832
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:13,277
- Good evening.
- <i>( TV playing )</i>

833
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,813
He's home. You can't knock
on the door like that.

834
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:19,816
I was taking the trash out
and you left it open.

835
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,452

836
