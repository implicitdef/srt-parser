1
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:09,558
You see now?

2
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:11,354
I'm here to tell you,

3
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,933
this remaining silent shit
ain't nothing like

4
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:15,727
they make it out to be.

5
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:19,925
You up in here
all tight with it,

6
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,194
waiting for your paid lawyer,

7
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,621
thinking you all wise,
ain't you?

8
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:28,312
No. See,

9
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,813
that worked when you some kind of
criminal mastermind...

10
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:36,312
When you ain't been seen
runnin' from the deed.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,152
When your own fuckin'
running partner

12
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:40,913
ain't in the next room,

13
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:42,830
putting you in.

14
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,142
He's telling it
like a little bitch.

15
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:01,429
We even went to mickey d's for him
because he was so motherfucking helpful.

16
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,800
2 quarter pounders, big fries,

17
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:08,336
McDonaldland cookies,

18
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:09,842
Dr. Pepper.

19
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:12,123
That's how your boy roll, right?

20
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,978
All right.
Step out.

21
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:24,824
- Where are we going?
- Break room.

22
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:26,686
So you can enjoy that, huh?

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,224
All right.
But I still ain't sayin' shit to you.

24
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,018
Marnell, what the fuck?

25
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,470
How many years you figure
we've been doing the same shit?

26
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:44,785
20 at least.

27
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,298
True.

28
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:51,924
True.

29
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:54,923
False.

30
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,530
Load him up.

31
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:58,576
- Some shit actually works, huh?
- Hell yeah.

32
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,566
Americans are a stupid people,
by and large.

33
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,288
We pretty much believe
whatever we're told.

34
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:10,498
So it can feel my heart beat?

35
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:11,849
Pulse? Yeah.

36
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:15,094
If Marnell say
I had the gun, he lying.

37
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,477
The machine tells the tale, son.

38
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,299
We ready, professor?

39
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:23,844
We'll start with an easy one.

40
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,164
Is your name in fact
DeShawn Fredericks?

41
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,850
Yeah.

42
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:36,473
True.

43
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:39,531
And do you reside in fact

44
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,014
the 1200 block of woodyer street

45
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,617
in west Baltimore?

46
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,713
Yeah.

47
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:52,508
- True.
- And did you and Marnell

48
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:54,624
shoot your boy Pookie
down on Cary Street

49
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:56,298
just like Marnell said you did?

50
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,636
No. No.

51
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,396
Lie.

52
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:09,105
You lying motherfucker.

53
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,919
Machine is never wrong, son.

54
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:14,689
Fuck, man!

55
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,906
Nigger can't never keep
his damn mouth shut.

56
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,344
I should've busted a cap
in Pookie ass my own self.

57
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,601
Left Marnell home and shit.

58
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,730
He just a bitch, is all.

59
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,825
The bigger the lie,

60
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:36,697
the more they believe.

61
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,910
First the BlackBerry.

62
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,761
Oh, he brought his tunes.

63
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,291
All the running shit
pay, don't it?

64
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:42,043
We got one coming in.
Unidentified number-one male.

65
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:45,050
- <i>You got him, Jimmy?</i>
- Yeah. More face-to-face.

66
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:50,966
Oh, man.

67
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,146
You know, this would be more fun
if we were actually getting paid.

68
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,852
Hey, you know,
I heard a story about you,

69
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,485
- when I was back in the west.
- It's not true.

70
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:02,970
- Haven't even told it yet.
- Whatever it is, it's not true.

71
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:05,900
You run a Vice undercover one time,

72
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:08,870
and instead of pulling up,
you went ahead and closed the deal.

73
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:11,382
I read this report where
you got blowed by this whore,

74
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:13,514
and you actually wrote it
that you got blowed.

75
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,464
You believe everything you read?

76
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:22,642
Look, man.

77
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
All I'm saying,

78
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:28,065
if I'm gonna take your package,
split me and be fair.

79
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:31,305
I got to pay all my people the same,
and here you're upping the price on me.

80
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,949
- Pay your people less.
- They my people, though.

81
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,556
Then short yourself.

82
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,015
Split is 60/40.

83
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,500
You want better?
You need to tool up.

84
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,022
And wait for Chris, Snoop,

85
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,430
and the rest of my people
come pay a call on your people.

86
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:47,005
We will be brief
with all you motherfuckers.

87
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:48,963
I think you know.

88
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,833
All right.

89
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:16,095
Northbound on Fulton.

90
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:18,689
Lester. Coming your way.

91
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:26,146
I see him.

92
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:27,825
<i>Roger that.</i>

93
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,310
Every day, same shit.

94
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,472
- Look at this pretty bitch.
- Ten-hut!

95
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:46,965
Just sit the fuck down.

96
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,432
I'm not gonna stand up here
and pretend to be insulted

97
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,653
because you all are pretending
to respect the rank.

98
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,171
Today, he's an S.I.C.

99
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,785
Tomorrow, he might be
a newly minted Lieutenant.

100
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,326
You never know with these
career-minded motherfuckers, do you?

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,007
If I was minding my career,
would I be in the western in command

102
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:03,535
of you useless fucking humps?

103
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,549
Okay, let's go to the readouts
and the warrants first.

104
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,634
- Fuck the readouts.
- Fuck the warrants.

105
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,712
What the fuck
is going on with our hours?

106
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,783
Easy, easy. If I had an answer,
you'd have an answer.

107
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,715
I'm in the same boat as you are.

108
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:21,321
2-odd weeks since I've seen
overtime or court pay,

109
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:23,418
and I gotta pay
the credit union,

110
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,584
the archdiocese for my kid's tuition,

111
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,801
and my ex-wife
so she can pay...

112
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:31,872
Shut the fuck up
and sit the fuck down!

113
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:34,065
In your fucking seats.

114
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:39,590
We're still authorizing overtime

115
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,969
and the state's attorneys
are still signing court slips.

116
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:43,571
But you ain't fucking paying us.

117
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,704
The union says
we're going down to the NLRB

118
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,156
- and deal with this shit.
- Word coming down

119
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,787
is that when the city's budget
situation is improved,

120
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:53,017
we'll all see that
as back pay or comp time.

121
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:55,292
- Every last hour.
- Back pay my ass.

122
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:57,401
This shit here is just paper.

123
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:01,150
65 hours of worthless paper
right here!

124
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,379
Officer brown, sit your ass.

125
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:06,824
Sit!

126
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:19,827
We're all professionals.

127
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,526
We're about to police
the roughest district

128
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:24,641
in one of the roughest cities
in the world.

129
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:26,818
Show some pride.

130
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:31,099
If promises were made,
promises will be kept.

131
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,687
The situation in the city
right now is bad,

132
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,786
but it won't stay bad forever.

133
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:39,376
We wait this out
like professionals.

134
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:43,699
Now, then.

135
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:45,827
Back to the readouts.

136
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,152
First item is from motor pool.

137
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:56,424
No marked or unmarked units
can be shopped on dickman street

138
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,853
- until further notice.
- What?

139
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,609
Cutbacks and fleet budgeting
require that all districts

140
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,264
make do with vehicles
in their current state of affairs.

141
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:05,629
So that means--

142
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:08,996
Shitbox cars
are falling apart.

143
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:10,615
Fucking know that?

144
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,323
<i>Where you at?</i>

145
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:26,068
<i>On his ass.</i>

146
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:30,466
You guys got the eyeball.

147
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:32,024
<i>All good, Lester.</i>

148
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:33,465
<i>It's all good.</i>

149
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,494
<i>Officer castor,
you have a call on line 79...</i>

150
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:44,484
- Natives are restless, huh?
- I don't know

151
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,736
how long we go before
the wheels fall off the car.

152
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:49,542
A year ago, they were promised
pay raises, pension bumps,

153
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,378
better equipment, better cars.

154
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,089
Now we can't even pay the o.t.

155
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,029
Gave them
the professionalism bit, right?

156
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,019
In the real world,
they pay professionals.

157
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:59,439
- That's why we call them pros.
- Major.

158
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:01,889
There's a problem on the back lot.

159
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,250
If it bothers you, clean them up.

160
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:07,250
- Fuck you, son.
- Fuck you right back.

161
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,692
That thing was all fucked up
when I got it for midnight.

162
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,528
- You ask anyone.
- Then, you clean it,

163
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,480
or you get the midnight shift
to clean it.

164
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:14,835
Clean this.

165
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,207
Fuck you, Gene. You don't leave it
like that for the next man.

166
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,210
You're the one
whining like a little bitch, Bobby.

167
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,575
As S.I.C., should I stop this?

168
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:32,383
That's my car.

169
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,841
What, you think this is
good for morale or something?

170
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,336
These guys haven't had
an honest paycheck in weeks.

171
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,376
We have no fucking morale, Sergeant.

172
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,948
Kid ran us around for half an hour.

173
00:11:58,323 --> 00:11:59,781
Amazing, ain't it?

174
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,323
Here we go.

175
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:16,930
He got a meeting.

176
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,156
Want me to come?

177
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:21,504
You go check on your corner.
I'll send word if it's on.

178
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,932
- He's moving.
- All right.

179
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:44,613
<i>Lester, are you there?</i>

180
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,780
Up on Reisterstown with Chris.

181
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,312
Marlo's on the move.

182
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:52,272
Should we follow him?

183
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:55,354
Why?
We know where he's going.

184
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,995
No, sir.
We've cut it to the bone already.

185
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:04,154
Cars are gonna go in service
for the next month.

186
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:06,238
And for as long as
we can get away with it,

187
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,238
we're deferring all overtime
and court pay.

188
00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:10,278
How's crime?
How are your stats?

189
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:14,414
It's a double-digit decline you wanted.
Not possible with these cuts.

190
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,059
For God sake, you got to
show us some kind of reduction.

191
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,850
I campaigned on that.

192
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:20,401
All this deferred overtime.

193
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,507
We'll pay it as we can.
And the pay raises I promised?

194
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,709
They're still coming,
just a year late.

195
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,555
Right now I got to throw
every dollar at the schools,

196
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,886
but you tell your people
I know I made promises.

197
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,997
Where else can you guys trim?

198
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:36,880
Well, we...

199
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:40,391
We've been running
a prolonged investigation...

200
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,242
into all the--

201
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,908
the bodies we pulled out
of those houses last year.

202
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,348
Months of surveillance.

203
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:47,700
Thousands of man-hours.

204
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:50,462
At this point,
we're not close to an arrest.

205
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:52,689
You're saying you want us
to come down on a case

206
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,532
in which 22 people were murdered

207
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:56,249
and left to rot in city houses?

208
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,727
We caught national news coverage
on those murders.

209
00:13:58,915 --> 00:13:59,925
Last year.

210
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,814
I don't want anyone saying
we're giving up on those murders.

211
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:04,613
I don't want to see that headline.

212
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,315
But given our fiscal situation,
we could...

213
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:10,496
temporarily suspend the investigation

214
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:12,369
pending new developments.

215
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,807
- Anything else?
- We need to take away

216
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,290
the 10-hour cap
on secondary employment.

217
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,543
You do that and your police
aren't doing police work,

218
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,324
they're guarding liquor stores,
bouncing nightclubs, putting up drywall.

219
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,806
Respectfully,
morale is at rock bottom.

220
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,907
You need to throw
our people a bone.

221
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:34,574
Or you could lose them for good.

222
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,104
Hold the line now...

223
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,932
And we'll get to a better place.
I promise.

224
00:14:58,373 --> 00:14:59,575
Say it, Norman.

225
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,438
You're thinking it.

226
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,267
Truth to power, Norman.

227
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:06,318
Isn't that
what I keep you around for?

228
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,479
When the governor threw
that 50-some million on the table,

229
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:12,118
- you should've picked that shit up.
- He takes the state bailout

230
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,236
- and he never becomes governor.
- He shorts

231
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:16,351
the police department,
the crime rate stays up,

232
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,048
he ain't no governor, neither,

233
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:20,729
just a weak-ass Mayor
of a broke-ass city.

234
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:23,837
Feel better?

235
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,256
A little bit.
You?

236
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:46,869
Boy folded it up.

237
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,717
He taking our shit 60/40.

238
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,749
- Nigger showed no heart at all.
- So more people

239
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,540
- could stand down there, right?
- Definitely.

240
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,198
Won't be needing no drama
behind his nonsense.

241
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,472
And po-po's still up on you, huh?

242
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,390
You are hot all the time, man.

243
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:06,681
Today they got the white boy
with black hair up on the roof

244
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,210
on Booker T. Washington.

245
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,546
Watching with his spyglass.

246
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,822
The young 'uns
saw him climbing up. Yeah.

247
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:17,272
So we do like this, then.

248
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:34,072
That's it.

249
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,498
All of that so he could
swap a few words.

250
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,759
How do you wiretap that?

251
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,346
Lester?

252
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,042
Are we done for the day, man?

253
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,478
<i>You don't want to stay on Chris,
see where he goes next?</i>

254
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,729
We've been on this guy for months.

255
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:52,014
- He doesn't slip.
- And no one's kicking our O.T.

256
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:55,011
<i>Yeah.</i>

257
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:57,008
<i>We're done.</i>

258
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:58,444
Copy that.

259
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:01,769
Greenhouse Gas right here.

260
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:07,160
Hey, Marcus,
you got a count for me?

261
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,687
- Spider, you got a count for me?
- For you? No.

262
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:20,751
How we do?

263
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,574
I can't say for sure.

264
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:27,771
They short, huh?

265
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:29,968
Man, I just know they ain't tell me.

266
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,193
Greenhouse Gas.

267
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:39,588
Go home, man.

268
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:42,069
Bug'll be out of school pretty soon.

269
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,714
I ain't you, Michael.

270
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,703
Go get Bug.

271
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:47,117
I'll see you tonight.

272
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:55,923
Greenhouse Gas right here.

273
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:57,931
Yo, we short?

274
00:17:58,183 --> 00:18:01,622
No, we good.
Got 60 left from about 1,400.

275
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:02,869
We own it, Mike.

276
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,006
So why don't you tell Duke?

277
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:07,226
Why you fucking with Duke, nigger?

278
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,344
I ain't fucking with nobody, man.

279
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:11,648
He just acting like a bitch,
that's all.

280
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,309
Greenhouse Gas is hot.

281
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:28,455
They're getting a little sloppy.

282
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:30,439
Did that meet in the same lot

283
00:18:30,762 --> 00:18:32,584
they've used twice
in the last week.

284
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,041
The one on McCulloh.

285
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,183
That's pretty thin considering
how long we've been on these guys.

286
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:40,269
They're gonna get lazy.

287
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,207
Fall into a pattern.

288
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,357
They all do, over time.

289
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,221
Someone say overtime?

290
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:49,046
Seriously, we did 14 hours
and we're only gonna get paid for 8.

291
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,522
Case has gotta go green

292
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:52,762
before they go black.
That's how I was taught.

293
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,514
180 hours and counting.

294
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,862
Couple more weeks
and you get a month's work.

295
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,827
Couple more weeks, I'll be in jail
for late payment of child support.

296
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:05,946
Who needs a taste?

297
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,185
Shit.
Who's buying, motherfucker?

298
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:09,865
I'll cover a round or two.

299
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,322
Then I guess I'm drinking
a round or two.

300
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:15,255
Oh, yeah, and a boat dock, huh?

301
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,850
Yeah. And the gazebo here?
For my wife.

302
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:22,282
You get any word from downtown

303
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,584
on when they're gonna start
paying out the O.T. again?

304
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:27,139
Because we going double shift
on these surveillances.

305
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,032
They haven't told me anything.

306
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,352
Guess I ain't in the loop.

307
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:38,002
They have to shut it down, Colonel.

308
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,569
Explain to me how we come up
on 22 bodies.

309
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,354
- Explain that to me.
- This comes straight from the hall.

310
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,350
You're talking about a year's worth
of work by my best people.

311
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:48,115
To just give up on all of that?

312
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:51,387
Colonel, we haven't made
an honest payroll in over a month.

313
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,298
Where the fuck is Carcetti?

314
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:55,003
The man promised us a new day.

315
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:56,932
He's tangled up
with the schools,

316
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,837
and we're on hold.

317
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:03,393
The Mayor's made a few
commitments to me personally.

318
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,983
If you want to call in a martyr
on behalf of this department,

319
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:08,644
- feel free.
- And while you're at it,

320
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:11,190
see if you can get
your take-home car back.

321
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,549
Budget officer called an hour ago

322
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,185
telling us to relieve colonels and below
of take-home vehicles.

323
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,121
Hold on. Hold on.
See, if you move it here,

324
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:36,699
then I got you.

325
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,250
Little man bringing it.

326
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,712
Yo, dude...

327
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:51,266
I've been thinking.

328
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,647
You ain't need to put in time
on the corner if you don't want to.

329
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:57,734
I mean, you're doing enough here
with Bug to get paid.

330
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,401
How you mean?

331
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,074
I'm saying
looking out for him,

332
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:05,784
and I've been thinking, like,

333
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,823
if you were to get locked up
for some shit,

334
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:10,160
how'd it be for Bug, you know?

335
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,887
So, who's gonna watch
your corner in the morning?

336
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:18,354
Thought I might
promote Spider,

337
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:20,826
see how he doing
for a week or so.

338
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:24,420
So, I'd be like a nanny and shit?

339
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:28,356
What am I gonna do before Bug
get home from school,

340
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:30,398
clean the stove
and bake some cookies?

341
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,066
Do what you want here, yo.

342
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,279
Before he get home,
time is your own.

343
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,339
You beat me.

344
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,979
Oh, snap, you beat me.

345
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:54,364
They're fucking liars,
motherfucking liars.

346
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:55,803
Easy, boy.

347
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:59,197
I was happy on patrol.
I was fine.

348
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,920
You were bored.

349
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:02,566
Fuck no. I was happy.

350
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:06,864
Motherfuckers come to me and say,

351
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:08,816
"it's a new day, Jimmy,"

352
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:11,076
talking shit about
how it was gonna change.

353
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:12,748
Shit never fucking changes.

354
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,994
If they had left me up and running
when Marlo was on them cell phones,

355
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,616
I'd have had him a year ago.

356
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,821
See?

357
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:22,044
But they can't do the right thing.
It ain't in them.

358
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:25,692
Now we're back on Marlo's ass.
We need to be on him 24/7.

359
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:27,619
The motherfuckers cut our overtime,

360
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,804
and they shopped
our best surveillance van.

361
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:32,111
Don't even think about trying to...

362
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:34,337
requisition a new fucking

363
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,417
- digital camera.
- They want to do it on the cheap.

364
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,514
Bunko on the prowl.

365
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:41,959
Hey, bunky Bunk,
come here!

366
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,978
- Jimmy.
- Come here, you virile beast.

367
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:46,355
Hey, you...

368
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:48,730
Buy me a drink, you whore.

369
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,187
With what?

370
00:22:54,803 --> 00:22:56,143
I'd have thought the bosses

371
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,880
would've at least figured out
how to keep paying Homicide.

372
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,133
Pete, come on.

373
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:02,826
Take these slips off me.

374
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:05,323
I'll pay you 50 cents
on the dollar against my tab.

375
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:07,128
- Cash only.
- When we get paid,

376
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,182
- you double your money.
- City's never gonna

377
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,327
be healthy enough
to go all that back pay.

378
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,482
How the fuck
are we gonna pay the bar tab?

379
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,715
We could always
knock off a liquor store--

380
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:17,900
G & L on Edmondson, thin plexi.

381
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,806
I'll take out the counter man.

382
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,305
- I'll cover you.
- I got the door, no problem.

383
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,994
Who's gonna be our wheel man?

384
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:37,591
Every plan, a weak link.

385
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:41,101
I heard they're closing
the foreign bureaus--

386
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,979
Joburg, Beijing, everything.

387
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,488
I heard layoffs
as bad as in Philly.

388
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,415
Bullshit.
They're not gonna lay off.

389
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,048
They'll offer buyouts first.

390
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:51,847
If they don't get enough of those,
they'll go right to layoffs. Watch.

391
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,381
What the fuck you care?
You got all the seniority in the world.

392
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,408
Be a shame
if they have to get rid of all them

393
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:59,306
- twentysomethings in the newsroom.
- Degenerate motherfucker.

394
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:04,141
Kleppner sure do like to hire
them sweet, young things, don't he?

395
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:06,700
23, 24 years old; model-thin;

396
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,445
long, straight hair;
and big, traffic-light eyes.

397
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:11,966
And half of them can
write a lick, can they?

398
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,453
Yeah. Our esteemed
managing editor

399
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,964
certainly does favor
a certain type, don't he?

400
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:19,591
Gentlemen...

401
00:24:20,222 --> 00:24:21,222
Question mark.

402
00:24:24,722 --> 00:24:25,824
Someday...

403
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,778
I want to find out what it feels like
to work for a real newspaper.

404
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:51,511
What? I've got calls out.
You start writing now,

405
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:54,394
and I'm not here 10:00 tonight
reworking your lead.

406
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:56,601
- Reworking my lead?
- Come on, Fletch.

407
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:59,085
Try to make the e-dot deadline
for once in your life.

408
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:03,103
- Any matter for the council meeting?
- Yeah.

409
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:06,053
I'll top it with whatever smells fresh,
make the double-dot.

410
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,393
They're gonna vote
on a homeless ordinance, right?

411
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,435
Maybe not.
Naresse is making noises

412
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,903
like she might
throw it back to committee.

413
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,222
Yeah? Well, find me
some news somewhere.

414
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:18,962
North Avenue?

415
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,596
Something is burning.

416
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:26,089
You...

417
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:28,497
You wonder what it might be?

418
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:30,429
I'm not the police reporter.

419
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:33,114
But you called Twig, though, right?

420
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,469
At least he's a columnist.
He's paid to sit on his ass.

421
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:42,560
What's your excuse?
Just left him in

422
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:44,450
the smoking lounge.
Hit him on his cell.

423
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,319
What kind of people
stand around watching a fire?

424
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:49,633
Some shameful shit right here.

425
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,852
Where else would you rather be,
huh, kids?

426
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:58,815
I got it, sir.

427
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,075
Hey, Jay.

428
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:14,025
A.P. Has got something on more
cutbacks in city bus lines.

429
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,112
- You don't say.
- <i>Daily Record</i>

430
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,536
had it this morning,
MTA trial balloon.

431
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:20,428
State desk is covering.

432
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:22,383
<i>Daily Record.</i>

433
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,862
All right, people.
It's 2:00.

434
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:27,248
I need budget lines in case
anybody is threatening

435
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:29,048
to commit and act of daily journalism.

436
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:35,095
City desk. Haynes.

437
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:37,739
You didn't, huh?

438
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,767
What the fuck are we supposed
to do for centerpiece art?

439
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,068
Great. Wonderful.

440
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:47,193
Photo didn't get out
for the racetrack piece.

441
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,842
What about art for the Hopkins
press conference? Did we get that?

442
00:26:50,114 --> 00:26:51,591
Scratched it for racetrack.

443
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,036
Hey, Swag, it's me again.

444
00:26:53,604 --> 00:26:55,772
Something is on fire
over in east Baltimore.

445
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,278
Surprise me with a nice,
pretty picture, huh?

446
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:01,649
Look.
What we have is drug violence

447
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:03,283
and plenty of it.
What you have

448
00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:06,965
is federal gun statutes that come
with a 5-year minimum, no parole, and,

449
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:09,128
we need to lower our murder rate.

450
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:11,947
Especially since you shorted
your police department budget.

451
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,353
It's no secret
we have budget problems,

452
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:17,011
all the more reason
for the U.S. Attorney to pitch in.

453
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:19,737
Officially, my priorities
are counterterrorism

454
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,131
and political corruption.

455
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:23,066
So you told me
when I asked you for help

456
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,115
on those bodies
in the vacant houses.

457
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:28,452
But I'm inclined to provide you
with a dozen FBI agents

458
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,572
and all the wherewithal
they need to work that case,

459
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:34,602
but we want Clay Davis
to go federal.

460
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:37,625
Our state's attorney
has developed that case.

461
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,615
He decides what to do with it.

462
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:43,009
He seems inclined to keep
Mr. Davis local at this point,

463
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:46,396
but if you could convince
Mr. Bond to reconsider,

464
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,197
we might find the resources

465
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:50,302
not only for the probe
of the row house bodies,

466
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,543
but the time to run
some of those gun cases for you.

467
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:55,605
But unless you get Clay Davis, you're
willing to let the killing continue.

468
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,389
Look. The FBI
and the U.S. Attorney's office

469
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,618
are not here to do the job
that your police department can't.

470
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:03,579
Don't blame us
for your ineffectiveness.

471
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,953
Baltimore is knee deep in blood.
Unless this guy can hang

472
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:07,662
a democratic legislator,

473
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:11,076
- he couldn't give a damn.
- And to protect that legislator,

474
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:13,129
who happens to be
one of the most corrupt

475
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,097
extortion artists in the state,

476
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,783
you'll burn every last bridge.

477
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:20,009
Do you think I give a shit about
Clay Davis? I am not protecting him.

478
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,276
- Then give him up.
- It's Bond's call.

479
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:23,867
- Talk to him.
- I have.

480
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:26,546
And he told your Republican
ass to go fuck itself, huh?

481
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:28,952
Well, let me double down on that.

482
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:40,045
Good luck with your crime problem.

483
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:48,328
That go well?

484
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:51,505
You know why he wants
the Clay Davis investigation so bad?

485
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:53,749
So he can stomp all over
the Democratic party

486
00:28:54,054 --> 00:28:57,278
and help give his asshole
Republican golf buddy another 4 years

487
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:59,659
- in the Governor's mansion.
- So, Bond

488
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:02,096
is keeping the case local
to help the party, huh?

489
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,381
No.

490
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:06,531
Bond is keeping the case so that
Clay Davis can be a trophy for bond.

491
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:09,192
My guess is, our newly elected
state's attorney

492
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:11,024
wants to, one day, run for Mayor.

493
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,966
Cuts both ways
for you, Naresse.

494
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,609
If the feds get Clay Davis, then
the case doesn't give bond any profile,

495
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:18,948
but if they get him
and flip him,

496
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:21,788
Clay might take
half the Royce administration with him.

497
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:23,800
You included maybe.

498
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,269
Don't you worry about me.

499
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:29,923
You, on the other hand,
just slammed the door on the feds,

500
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:31,711
and we need all the help we can get.

501
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:35,915
That's on them.

502
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:49,211
Pussy call.

503
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:52,014
I'm just glad to know
Marlo has a hobby.

504
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,676
Here.
Take her to her room,

505
00:29:57,836 --> 00:30:00,920
you know,
let her hit the mini bar, watch tv.

506
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,550
When she's settled,
go take care of the other thing.

507
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,708
I use Monk for my ride.

508
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:14,232
All right. Then moving on
to new business,

509
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,966
with John Hopkins
buying up everything

510
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,611
north of Monument Street
and tearing the shit down,

511
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:23,050
I think we all see the writing
on the wall in East Baltimore.

512
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,973
Yeah. They moving the 'hood out.

513
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:28,519
Niggers are going across
the line to Baltimore County.

514
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:31,307
Pretty soon, East Baltimore
won't be in Essex.

515
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:34,959
There's a market already along route 40
and down at Turner Station.

516
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:38,150
- And new territory go to who claim it.
- No. Ordinarily so,

517
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:41,967
but here, we got some of our
east side people being displaced, right?

518
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:45,471
I think we need to take care
of those most affected.

519
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:47,484
Meaning you.

520
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:53,285
Well, I am east side,

521
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:55,048
for the most part,

522
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:58,833
but I'm talking about Hungry Man
and Parker and Ghost,

523
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:01,513
you know,
others beside myself.

524
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:05,306
Hopkins ain't gonna affect
your market share, Marlo,

525
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,095
- so for those of us who suffer--
- All right. I see that.

526
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,427
Won't you let one
of your juniors get a shot

527
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:12,940
to open the county up?

528
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:14,616
Let a fresh face get a shot at it.

529
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,374
No disrespect, son,

530
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:19,883
but how I delegate to my lieutenants
is not a co-op concern.

531
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,479
Yeah, but how Slim feel
about that, though?

532
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:26,921
How you feel, tall man?

533
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:29,103
Ready to pioneer out there for us?

534
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,154
Naw. I'm good where I am.

535
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,847
Marlo, man,

536
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,429
you're a little out of order here.

537
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,812
Yeah. Well,

538
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,365
- it's just a thought.
- Look, man.

539
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:42,320
- What's the percentage breakdown...
- Don't sleep on Marlo.

540
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:44,792
He up to some shit here.

541
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,257
That puts me out 8 corners at least.

542
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:49,567
Hungry Man,
that was some prime real estate.

543
00:31:50,132 --> 00:31:52,667
It took me 6 years
to build up them corners.

544
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:16,038
Reginald.

545
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,790
Reginald.

546
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:31,976
I'm going to work. You know
I got night shift all this week.

547
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:36,256
You know if you stay down here
quiet like, you ain't need to sweat.

548
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:39,543
You don't stay here
when I'm not around. That's our rule.

549
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,803
I'm your brother, right?
I got nowhere to go when I leave here.

550
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,688
Last time I left you
alone in my home,

551
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,803
you dragged half my kitchen
to a pawn shop.

552
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,177
Remember that?

553
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,776
But you can keep
the door locked, right?

554
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:55,221
I'm down here.

555
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:57,583
My rules.

556
00:32:58,944 --> 00:32:59,866
You said.

557
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:41,398
The courthouse?
What the fuck?

558
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,790
I'll go in.

559
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:45,287
Rupert.

560
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:49,539
What now?

561
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,056
Major Crimes is being disbanded.

562
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:54,477
The detectives return
to regular rotation.

563
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,438
I got the word yesterday
from command.

564
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,105
The Mayor signed off.

565
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,990
They're quietly deep-sixing
the investigation into the bodies

566
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,354
and to Marlo Stanfield.

567
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:04,758
- A money thing?
- They're pulling back on everything--

568
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:07,563
Man hours, equipment,
lab work, motor pool.

569
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,442
Every last dollar we can find

570
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:11,548
is being shipped over
to plug the school budget.

571
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:13,956
Cedric thought he would try
to reason with Carcetti,

572
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:16,760
maybe see if we can keep
the Stanfield detail, at least.

573
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:19,288
Wait. What about Clay Davis?
That's going to grand jury soon.

574
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:22,678
If they ship Freamon back to homicide,
I don't have him on that, either,

575
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,593
- and Lester pretty much is that case.
- Excuse me.

576
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,293
- You know where the clerk's office at?
- Criminal or civil?

577
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:29,943
Criminal, definitely.

578
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,735
End of the hall, last door.

579
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,283
- When are you meeting with the Mayor?
- About an hour.

580
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:40,603
They gave me a few minutes
on the end of his day.

581
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:42,207
I'll go with you.

582
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:44,240
Come by my office and get me.

583
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,949
So, where you off to now?

584
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:52,128
Motions hearing in part 18.

585
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,841
It's the last thing on my sched.

586
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,547
And for state desk?

587
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:05,689
Additional cutbacks are said
to be coming in the city MTA routes,

588
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:07,464
trail balloon from the governor.

589
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:09,985
- Affects a lot of people, no?
- If it happens.

590
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,893
- They floated this once before.
- Still,

591
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,762
we can go outside
and give them the potential impact.

592
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:19,576
The truth is we're following
the <i>Daily Record</i> on this one.

593
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:23,411
Why don't we have that?
If it's a trial balloon--

594
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,260
We've been without a transport reporter
since the last round of buyouts,

595
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,938
- so--
- We should pick that up.

596
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,823
- Probably so, but--
- Just because

597
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,851
Chicago does a little belt-tightening,
there's no reason for us to fall down.

598
00:35:33,186 --> 00:35:34,359
Their cutbacks there

599
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:36,893
shouldn't affect our ability
to put out an excellent product.

600
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:38,610
Simply have to do more with less.

601
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:40,965
Certainly, we have more resources
than the <i>Daily Record</i>.

602
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,047
Though not a transport reporter.

603
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:47,353
Your Eminence,

604
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,270
slumming at the Metro meeting today?

605
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:51,714
- What do you know?
- City desk.

606
00:35:52,188 --> 00:35:54,060
State's attorney
complains about the decline

607
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,831
in quality police case work 20 inches

608
00:35:56,124 --> 00:35:58,079
from warm castle.
Got the city council tonight.

609
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:00,334
Probably won't get a vote
on the homeless initiative,

610
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:02,353
but we'll scratch some news
out of it somehow.

611
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:05,774
Two-car fatal on the Beltway,
two overnight murders in the city,

612
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,808
and a fire ongoing
in a Baltimore city row house

613
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,860
for which we may
or may not have art.

614
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:13,152
Regional affairs.

615
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,876
We have the Hopkins piece on biomed,
though

616
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:18,655
I'm told we didn't get
art on today's press conference,

617
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,180
and we have 15 inches

618
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:22,310
from the college park stringer
on U.M.

619
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,799
- not making it's deseg goals again.
- I'm told that,

620
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:29,020
numbers aside, the campus has become
much more hospitable to minorities.

621
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,172
I'm told that things
have changed for the better.

622
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:32,852
- Really?
- As you may know,

623
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:35,756
Gene Robbins is dean
of journalism there.

624
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,687
I had lunch with him
the other day...

625
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,926
- Nevertheless, they haven't--
- And he was saying

626
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:42,958
how the last few years
have really transformed

627
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:46,427
the school's reputation
with black faculty and students.

628
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:48,036
He's a white guy, right?

629
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,384
- Who?
- Journalism fellow--

630
00:36:50,614 --> 00:36:52,649
Dean Wormer,
Dean Martin, whatever his name is.

631
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:53,759
I worked with

632
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:56,337
Gene Robbins
in Philadelphia.

633
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:59,307
He is an excellent journalist
and a reliable source.

634
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:01,820
I think race is beside the point,

635
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,536
so why don't we hold on the deseg story

636
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:08,434
until we can assign someone
to do some more reporting,

637
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:12,053
get a real sense of how U.M.
Is perceived by minorities?

638
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:14,961
All right, then.
Let's firm things up,

639
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,913
take a look at where we stand
an hour from now.

640
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:22,223
Why poke him with a stick?

641
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,220
You know who Gene Robbins is.

642
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:25,381
Who's poking?

643
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:28,272
If I think something about a story,
I'm gonna speak on it.

644
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,437
You know what
a healthy newsroom is?

645
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:34,137
It's a magical place where people
argue about everything all the time.

646
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:36,544
- I'm not poking anyone here.
- "Dean Martin"?

647
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,115
Yeah, a little poke.

648
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:39,649
Thank you.

649
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,636
I know that wasn't no court date--

650
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,183
He already got the gun charge
postponed twice--

651
00:38:51,402 --> 00:38:53,020
So what the fuck was that about?

652
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,382
Remember that Russian
we locked up for murder,

653
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:57,456
part of the port case a year back?

654
00:38:57,773 --> 00:39:01,138
I didn't work that case with you, man,
so, no, I don't remember.

655
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:03,282
Well, Chris Partlow does.

656
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:29,086
Miss Gutierrez.

657
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,458
Get your ass over here.

658
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:40,590
You say that 120 people
were evacuated.

659
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,547
- Yeah. They were.
- You can't evacuate people.

660
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:46,450
I mean, you can, if you want, but
that's not what you want to say here.

661
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:48,421
A building can be evacuated.

662
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:52,187
To evacuate a person
is to give that person an enema.

663
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:54,506
The details, Miss Gutierrez.

664
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,388
At the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, God
still resides in the details.

665
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:01,808
- You teach them, Spry.
- What are we gonna do

666
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:03,740
with these children today?

667
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,912
Fuckety-fuck.

668
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:12,454
Another burnt doll.

669
00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:14,523
Carlyle again.

670
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:20,373
- <i>Photo.</i>
- Hey, Swag,

671
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,295
I'm looking at fire from east baltimore
and I got a burnt barbie in foreground.

672
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,960
And I might actually believe you
if it wasn't Carlyle who took the shot.

673
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:31,660
No fuckin' way I believe in
this picture. Print me something else.

674
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:32,821
<i>All right.</i>

675
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:37,017
Every fire photo he brings in
has got to be some burnt doll

676
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,566
somewhere in the debris.

677
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:40,571
I can see that cheating
motherfucker now

678
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,184
with his fucking harem of dolls
pouring lighter fluid on each one.

679
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:46,898
You check his fucking truck,
you'll find a whole collection of them.

680
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:48,641
What's your lead?

681
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,984
Council delays vote on the homeless
initiative at Carcetti's behest.

682
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:55,151
He doesn't want it looks like the city's
running the homeless out of downtown,

683
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:57,747
so he asked Naresse
to redraft the measure.

684
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:01,148
He's right.

685
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,518
You don't evacuate people.

686
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:06,775
- What?
- Never mind.

687
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:11,595
- Working on anything good?
- Just what day cops missed.

688
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:14,440
A fatal in Charles County
and a gas leak downtown.

689
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:15,954
Briefs, huh?

690
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:17,714
A quiet day so far.

691
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:19,325
It's a shit news town.

692
00:41:19,526 --> 00:41:20,526
You think?

693
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,583
How many stories
go national out of here? Not many.

694
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:26,645
Those bodies in the houses last year.
That got a lot of play.

695
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:28,645
And they didn't even solve it, right?

696
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:30,530
The story had no legs at all.

697
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,974
Since then, what else?

698
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Jeff.

699
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:35,891
Jeffy-Jeff.

700
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:37,723
What?

701
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:40,665
Come here.
Jesus Christ.

702
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:41,881
What now?

703
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,726
Did you stay for the zoning bills?

704
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,443
No.
I came back here to write.

705
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:47,141
Check the fucking library.

706
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,348
Shit, check the clips, too.
It goes back a ways.

707
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:53,252
No. Check that. You go back to the hall,
you get the vote on this thing.

708
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:56,125
Find out who sponsored this.
Find out whether Carcetti or

709
00:41:56,423 --> 00:41:59,159
- Naresse or whoever's behind it.
- You buttonhole them, find out

710
00:41:59,454 --> 00:42:01,030
- what the hell's going on.
- Why?

711
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,653
Who's Ricardo Hendrix?

712
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:03,883
A drug dealer.

713
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:05,915
Fatface Rick.
Alma, Scott.

714
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:08,738
This property
on Baltimore Street is a titty bar

715
00:42:09,032 --> 00:42:11,084
the city wants
for the Howard Street enterprise zone,

716
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:13,304
but this other property
they want to trade with him,

717
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,215
I want to find out
what that's all about.

718
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:17,603
This is a drug dealer
they're trading properties with?

719
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:20,419
Yeah. He's got a record as long as
your arm. A couple convictions, too.

720
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,246
Go, go.
Get some good quotes.

721
00:42:24,212 --> 00:42:25,762
I want you to go to this address.

722
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:28,702
It's a strip club called Desperado.

723
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:30,907
You ask around for the owner.

724
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,643
His name's Ricardo Hendrix.

725
00:42:33,186 --> 00:42:34,795
You tell them
until we get a comment,

726
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,253
we're gonna put ricky's picture
on the front page every day.

727
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,521
Who is he?

728
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:41,455
He's a drug dealer.
But from the look of this,

729
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,130
he's run some sort of game
at city hall.

730
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:47,584
We want a comment as to why he's
trading property with the city,

731
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,639
what he stands
to make off the deal.

732
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:53,490
What do you want from me?

733
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:56,733
Pull clips,
check the morgue files,

734
00:42:57,459 --> 00:42:59,477
write the "A" matter
on Ricardo's history.

735
00:42:59,797 --> 00:43:02,813
Wait. She goes to strip clubs
and I'm pulling clips in the morgue?

736
00:43:03,418 --> 00:43:05,034
You guys late
for the council meeting?

737
00:43:05,204 --> 00:43:07,225
- Looking for you, sir.
- Me? I'm racing them out.

738
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:09,295
I'm late for some charity thing
at the Walters.

739
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:11,326
I was told I could
get a few minutes tonight.

740
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:13,608
- You're on my schedule?
- Everything ran late today.

741
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:15,549
They were supposed
to ring you, I think.

742
00:43:15,737 --> 00:43:17,322
Do it quick
or do we reschedule?

743
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:20,584
Burrell's disbanded the unit
that's working the bodies in the houses.

744
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:22,857
When we're fat with
money, you can come back on it.

745
00:43:23,027 --> 00:43:24,670
Investigations are not like that.

746
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,419
You can't just drop one and then
pick it up down the road without--

747
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:29,908
We got no money.
We've got no fucking money at all.

748
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:32,002
There's nothing we can do
until the new fiscal.

749
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:32,986
But, Tommy,

750
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:34,731
that kills Clay Davis for me.

751
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,634
We're about to go to grand jury on it.

752
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:39,781
- Same unit is doing Clay?
- I need some profile for my shop.

753
00:43:41,566 --> 00:43:43,702
How much of that unit do you
need to bring the case in?

754
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:45,714
A couple of detectives.

755
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:49,418
I'll tell Rawls you can
keep 2 men for Clay.

756
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,768
The rest of it is shut down
until we're able to dig out, OK?

757
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:55,072
I got to run.

758
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:03,628
So one thieving politician
trumps 22 dead bodies.

759
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:07,447
Good to know.

760
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:11,892
To save money,

761
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:14,064
they're not even putting
ops cars in the street.

762
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:15,404
No more 2-man patrols.

763
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,241
- Jesus, where did the money go?
- Schools.

764
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:21,341
Carcetti didn't want to lay off
teachers, so he fucks us instead.

765
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:23,538
Seems like you got out
at the right time, huh?

766
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:25,403
Look at you.

767
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,912
Here's our boy Thomas
sporting the latest

768
00:44:28,178 --> 00:44:29,895
in downtown businesswear,

769
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:33,649
an understated ensemble
that puts the "be" in subtle.

770
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:35,756
There's a "b" in subtle?

771
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:38,306
Seriously,

772
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:40,221
you look well, Herc.

773
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,127
I'm doing good, man.
I got more work than I can get to.

774
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:44,879
It's like once word got around,

775
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:47,219
these fucking lawyers came out
of the fucking woodwork.

776
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:48,943
Which reminds me,

777
00:44:49,216 --> 00:44:51,012
I need one of you guys
to run a name for me.

778
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:53,503
Tags, registration, and phone.

779
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,892
While you're at it,
run a sheeting photo.

780
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,101
Cause, hey, I'm buying
the next round, right?

781
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:01,305
About fucking time!

782
00:45:04,894 --> 00:45:06,934
Not used to having money.
Kind of forget.

783
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:08,232
Let's get a round.

784
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:13,852
How's the brief?

785
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:15,919
It's clean and it bites.

786
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:19,187
- Deserves a front, off-lead, maybe.
- And we're saying what?

787
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:20,714
That it's a sweetheart deal

788
00:45:20,923 --> 00:45:22,955
for a titty bar owner
with a big criminal history.

789
00:45:23,498 --> 00:45:26,735
He sells his existing location
to the city for 1.2 million

790
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:28,969
and they sell him
a better piece of real estate

791
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:31,084
to relocate his club
5 blocks west for 200,000.

792
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:35,113
He clears a million
for laying in the cut.

793
00:45:35,323 --> 00:45:37,506
- What's the quid pro quo?
- We're going through donors

794
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:39,608
in Naresse's campaign committee
as we speak.

795
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:42,404
So far, we got 40,000
from Ricardo Hendrix

796
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,247
and a bunch of people all using
the same address as the bar.

797
00:45:45,498 --> 00:45:47,893
- Why wasn't this on your budget?
- Well, we found it--

798
00:45:48,418 --> 00:45:51,593
Actually, Jeff Price found it
hidden in the zoning bills,

799
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:53,613
bottom of the council agenda.

800
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,045
He caught it late,
but he caught it.

801
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,636
All right, front page,
below the fold.

802
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:02,183
Metro desk, Phelps.

803
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:05,389
Gus, Rrice

804
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:08,008
for you, line 2,
and he's got Naresse with him.

805
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:10,173
Aw, shit, here it comes.

806
00:46:12,357 --> 00:46:13,789
Gus? It's Jeff.

807
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:16,614
The council president would like
a word with you.

808
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,046
<i>On the record?</i>

809
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,624
No. She's given me her quote.

810
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:22,301
- She wants to talk off the record.
- <i>Put her on</i>.

811
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:28,926
This is all perfectly above board.

812
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:30,701
No doubt, madam president.

813
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:32,785
We need this property
for redevelopment

814
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,951
and it's in the city's interest
to allow Mr. Hendrix to relocate.

815
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:38,490
And is it in the city's
interest to give him a property

816
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,146
with twice as much floor space

817
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:42,722
and give him a million dollars
for his trouble?

818
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,767
Do you think he might have
made it clear to the council

819
00:46:47,934 --> 00:46:49,549
that Mr. Hendrix donated

820
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:52,359
$60,000 to your campaign committee?

821
00:46:55,174 --> 00:46:56,618
I don't know, Ma'am.

822
00:46:56,798 --> 00:46:59,876
Where I live, 60,000
buys a lot of good will.

823
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:05,233
Hey, Jeff, is that you?

824
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,363
I'm putting you on hold for Spry.

825
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,449
Yeah, give me
your on the record for Naresse.

826
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:10,982
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Yeah.

827
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:12,998
Shame we couldn't use
what she just gave us.

828
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,024
What do you got?

829
00:47:15,863 --> 00:47:17,846
Keep running through
that campaign finance shit.

830
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:21,479
There's at least $20,000
in contributions we haven't found yet.

831
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,912
Naresse all but confirmed it.

832
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,230
Yeah, it's me.

833
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,463
We're going late tonight.

834
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:11,674
I'm fine.

835
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:13,522
No, I'm not.

836
00:48:14,614 --> 00:48:16,124
I'm just tired is all.

837
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:19,374
I slur when I'm tired.

838
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:21,918
That's all.

839
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:24,737
Yeah.

840
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:27,674
Night.

841
00:49:19,882 --> 00:49:20,699
Bubs.

842
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:22,239
Hauk?

843
00:49:38,737 --> 00:49:40,924
That was a great pull at deadline.

844
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:43,260
Hey, any night
a Baltimore politician

845
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,171
calls you a son of a bitch
is a good night. Am I right?

846
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:48,792
That was a good pull by Alma,

847
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:51,996
getting that quote from Fatface Rick
for the home final.

848
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:54,167
"I'm a businessman.
City wants to help me out,

849
00:49:54,364 --> 00:49:56,163
"I ain't gonna argue."
Sweet.

850
00:49:56,512 --> 00:49:58,580
- Thank you.
- How'd you get him to talk to you?

851
00:49:58,768 --> 00:50:00,925
I just walked in, sat down,

852
00:50:01,441 --> 00:50:04,726
watched the dancers for a few minutes,
and he came over to me.

853
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:07,040
Thought I was looking for a job.

854
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:13,817
You deserve more than
a contributing line for that.

855
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:16,435
I don't know.
A contrib line is cool.

856
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:20,052
You can't go far on contrib lines.

857
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:22,560
Where do you want to go?

858
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:25,655
<i>Times</i> or <i>Post</i>.
Where else?

859
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:28,693
I don't know.
This is still a pretty good paper.

860
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,241
I brought it
to the Mayor personally,

861
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:13,702
but they're throwing their last dollars
into patrol and crime suppression.

862
00:52:13,993 --> 00:52:16,241
You think being on Marlo
and his people every damn day

863
00:52:16,531 --> 00:52:18,457
for a year isn't crime suppression?

864
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:21,280
We lowered the body count
just by sitting on these people.

865
00:52:21,724 --> 00:52:24,237
- They knew they're hot, huh?
- After a year?

866
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:30,210
Look. Promises
were made to me, as well.

867
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,182
I was told a new day was coming.

868
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:36,215
Clearly, this isn't it.

869
00:52:40,148 --> 00:52:41,668
Well, where
are we going, then?

870
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,303
You and McNulty are back
to the Homicide rotation.

871
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,004
Dozerman is temporarily
assigned to Tactical.

872
00:52:50,076 --> 00:52:52,797
Lieutenant. You're going
to fill a vacancy in the northern,

873
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:54,476
4:00-12:00 shift.

874
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:56,017
Freamon, Sydnor,

875
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,613
you two are assigned
to the State's attorney's office

876
00:52:58,915 --> 00:53:01,022
to help grand-jury
the Clay Davis thing.

877
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,989
When the money starts to flow,

878
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:14,268
I'll get you all
back on this somehow.

879
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:18,479
Sorry.

880
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:26,297
Wonder what it feels like to work
in a real fucking police department.

881
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,041
50 cent.

882
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:46,927
50 cent.

883
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:52,164
Obliged.

884
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,542
When did this break last night?

885
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:10,559
Gus saw it on the council
agenda around 9:30.

886
00:54:12,664 --> 00:54:14,489
It's a good fucking story.

887
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,194
Who's doing the react piece?

888
00:54:35,443 --> 00:54:36,707
Jeff will. Why?

889
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:38,539
I'm just--

890
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:41,085
I need a story. I'm up.

891
00:54:42,163 --> 00:54:45,108
Yeah. Stay hungry like that.

892
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:48,499
Good things come when they come.

893
00:55:02,475 --> 00:55:04,019
It's 2:00, people.

894
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,930
I need budget lines.

895
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:09,006
There are a million stories
in the naked city,

896
00:55:09,524 --> 00:55:12,707
but today you poor mooks
only need to throw me 3 or 4.

897
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,195
Good afternoon...

898
00:55:32,066 --> 00:55:33,867
The Orioles will not
pay for pitching.

899
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:36,376
-I should have never left the Bronx.
- You see this?

900
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:38,568
- What?
- One of our clients

901
00:55:38,873 --> 00:55:40,297
on the front page.

902
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,005
Represent Tiger Woods?

903
00:55:47,816 --> 00:55:49,806
All it cost me was a round of beers.

904
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:51,771
They fucking love me
in the department.

905
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,498
I'm a fucking martyr
is what I am.

906
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,657
Pull over some black minister,
piss him off,

907
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,821
and I lose my fucking job.

908
00:55:59,412 --> 00:56:00,551
One round?

909
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:03,487
You, a prominent defense investigator,

910
00:56:03,715 --> 00:56:06,081
let these other guys
buy a round of drinks ever?

911
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:08,953
OK.

912
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,196
It's time you learned a little something
about the expense account.

913
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:40,635
That's my desk.

914
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:43,609
What the fuck you say?

915
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:18,199
The prodigal son.

916
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:29,102
