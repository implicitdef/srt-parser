1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ENTER THE VOID (2009)

2
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,300
ENTER

3
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,700
Hey! Hey Linda, come here!

4
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
Come outside

5
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,100
I wonder what Tokyo looks like,
from up there?

6
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,900
- I don't...
- Why not?

7
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,300
- I'd be scared

8
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,800
- Scared of what?

9
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,000
Dying I guess...

10
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Falling into the void

11
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,600
They say you fly when you die

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Its fucking cold

13
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,100
Hey, check out
this book Alex gave me

14
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Its like the Tibetan bible

15
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,300
Alex the junkie?

16
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,500
Its all about
what happens after you die

17
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Look!

18
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,400
So your going
to become a Buddhist now?

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
No

20
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,800
You know they're all the same
Fucking Catholics, the Jew's ...

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Just a bunch of sucks
out to get their hands on your money...

22
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,900
Alex is gonna make
you a junkie...

23
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,000
and then he's going
to make you a fucking Buddhist

24
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,300
No, he's just a friend

25
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,700
I'm not gonna become a buddhist...

26
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,600
Alex is a fucking junkie.

27
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,500
He's not your friend

28
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,700
- C'mon
- He's not your friend

29
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,800
I gotta go

30
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,200
Hey, I'll see you later?

31
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,100
See ya.

32
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,400
Lock the door, just lock the door...

33
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,500
Ok, good

34
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,600
Why does she think I'm a junkie?

35
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,000
I know I'm not a junkie.

36
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
I know who I am

37
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
I know I'm not a junkie

38
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,800
She's my sister, sometimes
she doesn't know anything

39
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,900
There we go

40
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,200
This is the good stuff

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why else would Bruno
give this to me?

42
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,600
Probably wants a blowjob.
Thats disgusting!

43
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,400
Who do ya think I am anyways

44
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,100
I know I'm not a junkie

45
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,900
There you go...

46
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,000
This stuff doesn't taste good

47
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,500
These drugs taste like shit

48
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,000
Wow! Its already kicking in

49
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
This is it... its started

50
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh god, this is the best

51
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,300
What if you faint?

52
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
You're not gonna faint

53
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,500
I just know I will
You've done this before...

54
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
- Hello...
- Oscar... its Victor.

55
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,900
Hey, I'm looking for you...

56
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,900
Ah, can you bring my stuff?

57
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Can you come and get it

58
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
No... I need you to bring it to me

59
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,500
Oh... Ok. Where are you?

60
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,300
I'm at the Void...

61
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,900
Y'know I'm really sorry
about yesterday, I'll wait for you...

62
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
Actually...

63
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
- Actually I'd rather if you...
- Don't be long...

64
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,400
Hello?

65
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Hello?...
Oh, come on?!

66
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,100
Wake up

67
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
Get a hold of yourself

68
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh God...

69
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
its back

70
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,600
Collect yourself

71
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,000
Balcony

72
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Walk away from that

73
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,500
Keep your eyes open

74
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,200
My head is throbbing now

75
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,900
Its water

76
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,800
Water... Splash water
Splash tap water

77
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,600
Nice clean tap water

78
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,900
Its perfect

79
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,200
Back to normal

80
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Look at your cheeks,
look at your eyes

81
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,700
They look different

82
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,100
Shit

83
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
Is that the neighbours?

84
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400
Did they hear me?
Did I scream? Maybe I did?

85
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,600
Just calm down

86
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,200
Alex. Hold on

87
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Hey Oscar, you alright?

88
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,200
Ah its good man,
how ya doin'

89
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Nothing much...
Been pretty good, pretty good...

90
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,800
I think I need a shower!

91
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Oh, don't go to the balcony,
stay away from the balcony

92
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Hey, have you read the book?

93
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,900
- The book?
- Yeah

94
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
- Oh, The Book of The Dead
- Yeah

95
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,100
Yeah, haven't finished
reading it yet, its pretty good.

96
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,600
Its a wild book

97
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm glad you like it

98
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,900
Can I keep it,
so I can finish it?

99
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
- No problem
- Oh thanks... thanks

100
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
- You okay?
- Ah... well...

101
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
- I bumped into your sister
- Yeah?

102
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah. Following that cunt, Mario

103
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,300
I fuckin' hate that guy

104
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,300
I can't believe she's
going out with him.

105
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,100
If she ever gets pregnant,
I'll kill the baby.

106
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,700
I swear to God.

107
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Hey look, anyway...
Do you mind if we go and see her tonight?

108
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,600
I'd really like to see her...

109
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah sure

110
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,800
First we have to stop at the Void
I have some stuff for Victor

111
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
Wanna come?

112
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
- The Void?
- Yeah

113
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't' like the place,
but I follow you...

114
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
...and we go see your sister

115
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
- Yeah, lets go
- Great!

116
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
- Can I grab some water?
- Yeah sure

117
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
Water!

118
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,000
You're not taking it all,
are you?

119
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
No, only his share

120
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,100
- Man, thats alot of gear
- Yeah

121
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Shit!? Thats fucking dangerous
You should let him pick it up himself

122
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
No, he won't come here anymore,

123
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,500
not after what happened with his mother.

124
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,800
- What? He found out
- Yeah...

125
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
- How did he find out?
- I don't want to talk about it

126
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Alright, can I take the water?

127
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,000
- Bring it
- Okay

128
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,400
The streets are really empty.
Is it a holiday today?

129
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,900
- Hey whats wrong with you?

130
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
- You tripping man?!
- Yeah. You can tell?

131
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,300
Yeah, you look really fucked up...

132
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,900
I popped some tabs this morning...
and just took a hit of DMT before you came...

133
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,100
Shit, looks like a good day!

134
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
And the day isn't over either!

135
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Hey, do you think Bruno
has anything stronger than DMT?

136
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,900
C'mon, you'll fry your brain man!

137
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,400
You should finish The Book of The Dead,
that will be a lot better

138
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,900
but wait until you die,
then you get your big trip

139
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,800
The book is still confusing to me

140
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,000
How would you explain it?

141
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,800
Um, its really hard to explain...

142
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,200
basically, when you die...
your spirit leaves your body...

143
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
...actually
at first you can see all your life,

144
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,700
like reflected in a magic mirror.

145
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Then you start
floating like a ghost,

146
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,300
you can see anything
happening around you,

147
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,000
you can hear everything
but you can't communicate.

148
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,100
Then you see lights...
lights of all different colours...

149
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
these lights are the doors that pull you
into other planes of existence...

150
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,700
but most people... actually

151
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,300
like this world so much,
that they don't want to be taken away,

152
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,300
so the whole thing
turns into a bad trip,

153
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,800
and the only way out
is to get reincarnated.

154
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
- Is that making sense?
- Yeah, I guess so...

155
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,500
I dunno, whats the bad trip?

156
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,200
well, you got all these nightmares...
you know, you go like, yo' crazy...

157
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,200
all your fears become reality
and it scares the shit out of you...

158
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,400
Its like whats
happening to your mind, right?

159
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,100
At that point,
you wish you never died...

160
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,200
And, some new lights appear to you

161
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
they represent all these couples making love...

162
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,600
and then a light comes out from their bellies,
and if you get closer

163
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,400
they give you a vision
of a possible future life

164
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
and you choose a life that suits you the best
you know, end up in the womb...

165
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:57,000
and you're reincarnated
end of story

166
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,300
and basically you do this
forever and ever...

167
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,100
until you manage to break the circle

168
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,200
you follow me?

169
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,700
So you mean, we're stuck in this world
for all of eternity?

170
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,700
There's nothing better out there?

171
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
Hey, y'know what?
I can't wait to see your sister

172
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
She looks real beautiful man

173
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,700
I know
but she's still my sister okay...

174
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,500
I know, I know, I'm only saying...
I'm not blind, she's gorgeous.

175
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,400
Fuck off

176
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,100
- Taxi

177
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,900
You should look after her
What are you talking about?

178
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
Your turning into a dealer

179
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,100
- I'm not turning into a dealer
- Yes you are, what we going to do tonight?

180
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,500
You know...

181
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,800
look what your sisters doing,
you know...

182
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
she' trying to stop you
from doing that...

183
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,500
Are you schizophrenic?!

184
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,700
- your the one who introduced me to your provider
- Ah, c'mon.

185
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,100
Honestly, you should try to get a job
you know...

186
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
I don't know

187
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,800
I mean, your a smart guy,
you know... Good dj

188
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,300
Maybe ask the club to get you a job
part time, like bartending...

189
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
its really fucking easy I did it

190
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,000
piece of cake... Especially in Tokyo

191
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,800
Your a foreigner, your good looking...

192
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,900
You know, theres a big difference -

193
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,900
between taking psychedelics
and being a dealer, you know?

194
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,500
I said I'm not a dealer!

195
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,500
You're a dealer
and you're a mother fucker, man

196
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,100
I can't believe
your fucking that old bitch

197
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,500
You're in Tokyo, theres a lot
of fucking cute chicks everywhere,

198
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
and your fucking some old bitch,
and she's a foreigner as well...

199
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,800
at least if your fucking a Japanese...

200
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,200
- old bitch, you know...
- She fucked me

201
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,400
Anyway... Oh man... Police!

202
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Fuck!

203
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,200
Hey um...

204
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,100
I want to dump my bottle...
be back in a sec'

205
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
- Have you heard of Datura?
- No

206
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,800
Its crazy shit!

207
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,900
- Whats Datura? Is it a mushroom?
- Yeah,... its a plant

208
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,700
that takes you somewhere, you know
quite freaky...

209
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,200
Whats it... Whats it like...? I mean,

210
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Whats the trip like on Datura?

211
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,300
Ah... like... you don't even know your
fucking tripping, you know...

212
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,900
You'll be on the floor,
talking to every-fucking-body...

213
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,200
but you realise
two weeks later...

214
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,600
you were not talking to anybody,
you know what...

215
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,900
I took it, I saw that chick
man she was gorgeous

216
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
...hang on a sec, hang on,
she was fucking gorgeous

217
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,000
I really fucking like her, right...

218
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
And I tried to kiss her,
been talking for 30 minutes

219
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,400
tried to kiss her, she fuckin'
disappeared, she never existed!

220
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
THE VOID

221
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,400
I don't want to see you doing
that shit with Victor right, so...

222
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,600
I wait for you at Express on food
and I see you in a minute

223
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,900
- Okay
- Right, I catch you in a minute man.

224
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,100
Yeah, see you later

225
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,900
Linda's right,
Alex is way more of a junkie than me.

226
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,200
Hope Victor's here already

227
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,800
I don't want to wait for him

228
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,500
I got your stuff.

229
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
I'm sorry.

230
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,600
- What?
- I'm sorry

231
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,100
Police!
Shit!

232
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,100
Police! Open up!

233
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,200
What are you doing!?
I'm gonna call my embassy!

234
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,800
Hold on, hold on a minute!

235
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,700
I'm coming out!

236
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,800
- Open!

237
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,400
I have a gun!

238
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,200
I have a gun!
I'm gonna shoot!

239
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,100
If you don't leave I'll shoot!

240
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,600
What do you want me to...

241
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,500
What...? They shot me...

242
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
They shot me...

243
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Did they kill me?
Did they shoot me?

244
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,700
I don't want to die like this...

245
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I need help

246
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,200
I have a sister

247
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,700
Thats blood on my hands

248
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,700
Is that blood?

249
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,300
Maybe I'm in prison
they've caught me

250
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Its the police, isn't it

251
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,800
Didn't do anyone harm...

252
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,800
...or hurt anyone.
Life sucks

253
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,700
I can't feel my arms

254
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,700
This is not happening
Just tripping... tripping

255
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
But it is...

256
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Its the DMT

257
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Who knows?

258
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm dying

259
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,000
Am I dead?

260
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,100
None of this is real

261
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm floating

262
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,500
What'll happen to her?
My little sister

263
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,000
Please help me
I need your help

264
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,600
Then take me home

265
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,500
I don't want to die
I don't want to die like this

266
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,400
- Whats happening?
- Accident

267
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,200
Victor... Victor!

268
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
- What happened to Oscar?
- They shot him!

269
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,200
SEX
MONEY
POWER

270
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,700
I have to take that

271
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,000
Linda...
The police shot your brother at The Void

272
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,300
He was bringing some shit to Victor and...

273
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,300
I don't know what happened

274
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,400
I heard the shot

275
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,100
and Victor said they killed him
You should run...

276
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,000
- So, who was that?
- Doesn't matter

277
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,600
Mario? Mario?

278
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,900
Linda...
The police shot your brother at The Void

279
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,100
He was bringing some shit to Victor
and I don't know what happened

280
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,000
I heard the shot

281
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,300
and Victor said they killed him

282
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
You should run there to find out

283
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,400
I'm sorry, I was outside

284
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,900
Can't tell you more,
the police are after me now...

285
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,600
please call me back

286
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,700
Oscar

287
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
- Oscar do you love me?
- Yes

288
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,500
- How much?
- Alot

289
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,600
Whats alot?

290
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,800
Mama

291
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,000
Do you remember that pact we made?

292
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,600
Kind of

293
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,500
We promised
to never leave each other

294
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,500
Never ever?

295
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,700
Never ever.

296
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,400
- Do you swear?
- I swear

297
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,900
- And if you die?
- I'll come back

298
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,100
This is a blood pact

299
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,800
Now we'll always be together

300
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,300
Stop it! I'm not going you bitch!
Oscar!

301
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,100
Oscar don't let them take me!

302
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,300
You promised me!
Oscar, you promised me!

303
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,100
No! No! No! No!

304
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,800
And she was sent to a foster home, I was sent
to a different one, life became like a nightmare

305
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,800
You should bring her to Tokyo

306
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,400
I miss her so much...
She's younger, and she's still in school

307
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,400
Come meet my flatmate

308
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,600
- Oscar
- Hey, Hi

309
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,700

310
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,600
What! Holy shit
No way, Wow

311
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,200
Pretty good eh

312
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,500
Yeah thats extra pretty insane
its like Tokyo on acid

313
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,700
And this is the plane...
that brings your sister

314
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,700
Trust me, I really want to

315
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,900
Money, money, money,

316
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,900
Money, money, money,
you can make money, you're smart...

317
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,500
Rob a bank!

318
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,400
Yeah! Yeah! Its like the hardest thing
I can think of, I'd rather be a drug dealer

319
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,200
No man, thats fucking dangerous, you know

320
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,100
Shitty job

321
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,000
Good drugs are nice here but...
you can make alot of money but...

322
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,300
you can go like
really deep into the shit, you know

323
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,800
You can end up in prison...

324
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,000
My mums the same when she was young.
To make money she was a go-go dancer

325
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,300
- Really?
- Yeah!

326
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
She's an amazing woman...
You should come and meet her

327
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Yeah

328
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Come out for dinner
come meet my parents

329
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,500
When I met her,
she was a go-go dancer in Tokyo.

330
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,100
Yeah, I went down to the club a few times...
Got a disease...

331
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,500
Anyway! Anyway!

332
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,900
- Tell us about you
- Ah, um...

333
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,200
Your parents here in Tokyo?

334
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,300
No, no,
my parents passed away a long time ago

335
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,500
What happened?

336
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,900
If you want, I can find
the money to lend you. How about it?

337
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,200
You don't have alot
of friends in Tokyo, right?

338
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,900
And Victor?

339
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,200
What about Victor?

340
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,600
- Nobody knows I'm here, right?
- Nobody

341
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,500
Hey, thats beautiful

342
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,700
- You know what this reminds me
- What?

343
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,300
Smoking...

344
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,500
It reminds me of sucking
on my mothers nipples

345
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,700
Best thing in my life, yeah

346
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,400
Freak... When is this acid
gonna be hitting me?

347
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,500
You know the good thing about LSD

348
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,800
you can manage to overcome your fears

349
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,700
he can take you to other stations
wherever you want...

350
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,000
Ma, what happens if you die

351
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,000
I'll be with you forever

352
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
I will always watch you

353
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,900
I will watch you from the sky

354
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,200
- You promise
- I promise

355
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,900
You love Daddy
more than you love me?

356
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,700
No, I love you both

357
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
But its a different love,
a very different love

358
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,200
Mom... mom

359
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Hey, hey!

360
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,300
Remember me?

361
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
No?

362
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,000
Hey, do you take drugs?

363
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,000
Drugs?

364
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,000
- Yeah do you take drugs?
- No

365
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,900
- Never once have you taken drugs
- Never once

366
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,900
- Never once?
- Never once

367
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,200
But I like alcohol

368
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,100
Yeah? So you like alcohol
then you like drugs

369
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,700
It's like one step, then the next step

370
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,500
One step, yeah!

371
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,200
- David?

372
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,500
Some of my friends said I can come back here
and get some stuff to party with

373
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,400
Who's that,
who's your friend?

374
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,100
It doesn't matter

375
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,300
It always does matter, who's your friend?

376
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,900
Gaspar

377
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,000
Alright, thank you...
What do you want?

378
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,600
How much is coke?

379
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,800
10 gram for sixty

380
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,400
- Okay, yeah thats good
- Are you sure?

381
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,200
Here take it
Just... There you go!

382
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,700
- Nice one mate
- Be careful, they're really trippy

383
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,200
- Hey guess what?
- What?

384
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,400
- I finally found an apartment
- Thats great

385
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,700
I have a job now, and I have
enough money for your ticket

386
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,600
- Are you kidding
- Isn't that exciting?

387
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,400
Oh my god... How'd you make
enough money to buy me a ticket?

388
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,700
- Thats crazy
- Hey I told you I have a job

389
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,100
Oscar I love you!

390
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,300
Start packing okay?

391
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,500
- What?
- Ah, nothing

392
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,700
So what we getting?

393
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:45,200
Um, e's and acid
and I think I'll get some DMT too

394
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,800
- Oh, nice
- Yeah

395
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,500
Can I come with you?

396
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,700
Not a chance, guys' so paranoid

397
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,400
Do you have the money though?

398
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,100
Here you go

399
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,700
The drug guy
hes a dirty bastard you know

400
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,100
Yeah, he likes boys

401
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,300
- Who is this?
- Bruno, the guy that gave me drugs

402
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,700
Don't even take a drink, you might wake up
two days later with shit in your mouth...

403
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,500
Or your own shit, you know

404
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:29,500
I should be able to get him to see you today but
I won't come back with you so you should be careful...

405
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,200
You know what his new trick is?

406
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,700
He can't even be turned on by fucking now
So what he does is...

407
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,600
Hey, I'm not gonna
jump from here am I?

408
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,200
Hey, once a new guy
gave him a blowjob, yeah...

409
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:51,300
He sticks his finger inside his own ass and then
wipes his finger on the back of their head

410
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,600
So they walk around
with shit on their hair

411
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,600
Thats the guy I was telling you about

412
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,500
Hey, you look just like me...

413
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,000
- Whats your name
- Oscar

414
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,900
- So what do you want?
- Do you have any LSD?

415
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,500
Lets have a look...

416
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,900
Good, Oscar, check this

417
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,100
What happened to him?

418
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,900
Poor baby,
screaming for his mum all night

419
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,100
Yeah, this is what
I'm looking for...

420
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,800
Cheers, mate

421
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:42,800
- Nice!
- Good shit!

422
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,700
Hey, do you have any DMT?

423
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
DMT? I might have a little bit left

424
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,000
You ever tried GHB?

425
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,200
Its funny you know
DMT only lasts for six minutes...

426
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,800
But it really seems like eternity

427
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,000
Its the same chemical
that your brain receives when you die

428
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,900
Its a little bit like... Dying would
be the ultimate trip, you know

429
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,500
Hey, lets try this

430
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,400
Be careful

431
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,000
You see these tunnels,

432
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,300
it leads to huge gutters

433
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,500
you know, all those bums hiding there...

434
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,700
people go at night in those gutters...

435
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,600
What do you think?

436
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,300
- Its fuckin' awesome
- Yeah?

437
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,900
Imagine if like the walls are all clear

438
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,800
and all your friends
are inside, like, fucking

439
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,100
- Oscar!
- Yeah

440
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,800
Come and check it out,
I have something for you

441
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,900
I'll show you that
before you try DMT

442
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Tibetan Book of The dead

443
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,600
I'm assuming its about death

444
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,100
Well, it tells you how your spirit
comes out from your body after you die

445
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,300
Have you had a out of body experience?

446
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,700
- Have you?
- Yeah, once

447
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,000
Whats that like?

448
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,400
First - Took me so long to get there

449
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,600
had to practice,

450
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,600
slowing down my breathing
slowing down, slowing down...

451
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,900
Its like my mind is out,
and I can see myself, just above myself...

452
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,500
I really freaked out because

453
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,400
I would not be able to get back in my body

454
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,700
Yeah its fuckin' crazy, you know
Yeah its cool, you know

455
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,900
- but...
- Hey its me, again

456
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,700
Check this out, check this out

457
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,500
Hey its me, again

458
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,500
- its me Linda
- Your sister?

459
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,800
Don't forget I'll be arriving at the airport

460
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,900
Monday evening at six pm...

461
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
and you will be there, won't you...

462
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,900
Hey!

463
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,300
Missed you so much

464
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,200
Look at that!

465
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,400
When you and grandpa die
what will happen to us?

466
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,500
You'll be taken care of dear

467
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,700
We promise, you'll be taken care of

468
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,100
No! No! No!

469
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,500
Oscar!

470
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,900
Oscar!

471
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,600
Oscar!

472
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,400
You know what?
I dreamt again of the accident

473
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:50,100
Yeah, well it doesn't matter, we're going
to be like a family from now on. Just you and me.

474
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,800
Do you want some more?

475
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,200
Was it good?

476
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,700
Hey, thats for a club

477
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,400
Wanna go?

478
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,100
- Hey take this pill
- What is it?

479
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,300
- Its ecstasy
- I've never did it before

480
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,500
- Just take it
- Is it dangerous?

481
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,200
Its a drug c'mon
Its like a vitamin, okay!

482
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,000
Girls got moves!

483
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:15,500
Your sister is a real tight hottie

484
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,000
You gotta take care of her

485
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,800
The men in this club...

486
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,700
Come and dance with me

487
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,400
Hey!, Come on!

488
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,900
She likes me...

489
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,300
Hi heres the deal, you float me the
money for the deal

490
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,500
I take the risk scoring and selling stuff,
we go for a 50/50 split and we split all the profit

491
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,900
I can't wait! Who's your dealer?

492
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,700
Thats none of your business

493
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,000
because, how much do you need?

494
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,000
Look, where were you?

495
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,100
I was looking for you...

496
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,700
That guy got you way too drunk

497
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,300
Where were you

498
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,800
Hey guys!

499
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,400
Hey seriously, lets go

500
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Come on

501
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,900
Watch the step

502
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,400
Let go of me!

503
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,500
Do you know that tomorrows' the
anniversary of Mum and Dads death

504
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,200
I'm having fun

505
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,000
It's like heaven

506
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,400
So beautiful

507
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,100
I really feel so happy here with you

508
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,000
I feel free

509
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,300
I feel very very free

510
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
- You promise me you'll never leave me?
- Of course

511
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,000
- We die together?
- Never die

512
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,900
- We'll never die?
- Never

513
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,200
- We're immortal
- Yes

514
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,900
- We will never die
- Good

515
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,700
What...?

516
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:48,100
I missed you... I just missed you so much

517
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,800
- Have I grown
- Of course

518
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,600
I look like a woman now?

519
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,200
- Boo...
- Do you believe in reincarnation?

520
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,600
I don't have a mental age of 5 anymore

521
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,000
Don't you want to find a real job?

522
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,500
Fuck no!
Everybody who has a job is just a slave

523
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,200
There's one important thing though,
its to have a goal

524
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,600
Like... Do you have a goal?

525
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,900
I don't know

526
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,800
- You should have a goal
- Maybe like have a big love affair?

527
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,600
Hey what did that guy want
with you in the nightclub?

528
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,000
- He offered me a job
- Doing what?

529
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,700
- Hey - Your Mario right?
- Yeah

530
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,200
Like thats my sister

531
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,300
Don't touch her okay

532
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,100
Don't be a bad brother

533
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,000
So how much do you owe him?

534
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:04,000
Ah, 50 pills

535
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,600
It's for me and my friend,
Look man I don't wanna know your friend

536
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,700
I don't want him to know me, okay?

537
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,900
OK

538
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
Hi baby, you like snakes?

539
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,400
And don't look so nervous,
you're with friends here

540
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,700
Does he want any coke?
Any ice?

541
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,900
No... Do you have any DMT

542
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,600
No...

543
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:49,900
Come here

544
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,700
What are you looking at?

545
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,500
- Want to try some?
- Sure

546
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,500
Get ready you guys

547
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,600
What the fuck are you doing here?

548
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,900
It doesn't matter to you
I'm not hurting anybody

549
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,000
- What?
- Don't touch my stuff

550
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,800
- Your selling the drugs to my girls
- Fuck off! Give it back

551
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
Fuck!

552
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,200
If I ever see you in here
I'm gonna kill you!

553
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,400
- Do you know what Mum and Dad said?
- What?

554
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,700
That they would bring us to Japan one day

555
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,700
- Can doggy come?
- Yes

556
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,400
Whats up?

557
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:21,500
Where the fuck were you?
You didn't come home last night, you didn't call me

558
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:26,900
You can let me know the next time
you get laid by that dick-sucker

559
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,700
If you mean Mario, I wasn't with him

560
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,800
What?

561
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,900
Are you jealous?

562
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,800
Oscar, who is this man?

563
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,600
I'm his friend...

564
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,400
Hes doing... He's... He's trying to fuck me

565
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,400
- Bruno

566
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800

- I'm glad you could make it

567
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,300
So I know you like MDMA right

568
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,700
Sure

569
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,400
- Do you want to try some of this?
- Yeah, I can just take it? - Sure

570
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,400
You can worry about the... price later...

571
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:23,200
Straight from Amsterdam
Real trippy shit man

572
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,100
Cool... Thanks man!

573

Got you a little DMT

574
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,600
Just light her up...
Bit longer c'mon, real, real go-for-it

575
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:44,600
Thats the boy... Just want to be careful,
you might drop it and burn yourself

576
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,700
So if you want...

577
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,500
I can help you out next time,
I can hold it for you

578
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,200
- Hey
- Hey

579
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,100
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to see you

580
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,800
Are you fucking crazy?!
Get off, get off

581
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,400
- Hello Oscar how are you?
- Hi I'm fine

582
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,000

585
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:53,400
I don't know why I'm paying you for this shit

586
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,300
Have you slept with my mother?

587
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,800
What are you talking about?

588
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,800
Have you fucked my Mom?

589
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,100
Yeah

590
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:39,500
Keep your fucking pills! You piece of shit!
You piece of shit, you piece of fucking shit!

591
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,000
Victor!

592
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,500
Victor!

593
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,700
Victor!

594
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,600
Victor!

595
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Victor!

596
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,200
Victor, call me back

597
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,600
- Hello
- Oscar its Suzy

598
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,600
Victor didn't come home last night
Do you know where he is?

599
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,900
No

600
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,900
Will you call me
if you hear from him please

601
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,300
What you dreaming about Oscar?

602
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,800
Do you remember that pact we made?

603
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,400
Mmm, kind of

604
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,800
We promised to never leave each other

605
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,400
No matter what

606
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,600
Never ever?

607
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,600
Never ever.

608
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,700
I got into a fight with Victor last night

609
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,500
Do you want a trip?

610
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,600
You sick?

611
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,800
Linda...

612
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,700
I wonder what Tokyo
looks like from up there?

613
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,200
I don't...

614
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,400
Why not?

615
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,900
I'd be scared

616
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,900
Scared of what?

617
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,600
Of dying

618
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,700
- Huh?
- Oscar its Victor

619
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,700
Have to bring the shit to Victor

620
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,300
- Wanna come?
- Sure

621
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,400
Have you read The Book of The Dead?

622
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,200
I'm sorry

623
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,800
Don't worry I'm burning his stash now

624
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,600
Yeah, everything. Gone.

625
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:52,200
The fucking assholes,
first they said he had a gun

626
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,000
and now they won't even
take a fuckin' autopsy

627
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,700
I can't believe this is real...

628
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,200
Fuck

629
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:46,600
But why is he still here?

630
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,700
Your Alex's friend, right?
Tell us about him.

631
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,500
I'm asking you say something!

632
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,700
- I don't know anything
- Yes you do, don't lie

633
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:49,000
I can smell when people lie

634
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,200
And if you can help us,
we can help you out

635
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,200
We can help you
to get out of this situation

636
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,500
If you don't, you go to jail

637
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:02,500
And you don't want to go there,
so tell us about your friend Alex

638
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:04,900
We know that, he knows the main supplier

639
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:07,900
Say something!

640
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,900
What did he say? They say
Linda's brother had a dangerous friend

641
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,700
Who attacked one of the officers...
And they want us to let them know any information

642
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,500
Its in Japanese, I can't read it

643
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,300
C'mon, I can do it for you

644
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,100
It's positive isn't it

645
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,500
Yes, it's positive

646
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,400
- You alright?
- Oh, man

647
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:33,300
You're sweating alot... So, you mean
I can't get any coke from you

648
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,300
No. I got rid of my entire stash

649
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:40,800
How do I know Oscar didn't
give my name to that slime bag Victor

650
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,500
- No it is your fault!
- Who made the call?

651
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,600
I didn't call the police!

652
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:10,700
You called them!
You called them!

653
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,300
Get the fuck off me!

654
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,000
Hey we're a family here!

655
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,600
Stop it, just stop it!

656
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,700
My mothers a bitch!

657
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:20,900
Don't talk to your mother like this!

658
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,400
She fucked my friend!

659
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:25,400
And you think you can play man of the house?!

660
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,900
- I'm the man of this house!
- You are not the man of this house!

661
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,200
Now get out. Get out!

662
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:39,900
- What are you doing?
- What do you think you're doing?

663
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,800
- I despise you
- I fucking despise you, I fucking hate you!

664
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,600
Don't you see she's just using you?

665
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,100
No. Thats not the point.

666
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,000
It's just that I like Linda

667
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,400
She even want to have a baby with me...

668
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,300
- Hi
- Hey

669
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,500
Hey, are you okay?

670
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,700
No man I'm not okay, I'm in deep shit

671
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:48,000
Look can you do me a big favour

672
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,400
Can you go to my place and
speak to my roommate

673
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,800
Yeah, I need some money

674
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,500
Yeah, he knows where it is

675
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:05,900
And I need a jacket as well, I'm freezing

676
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:21,200
Don't call him, you go to my place

677
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:24,700
I'm sure the police are tapping our phones

678
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,900
Okay, okay I'll call you later
and give you a place for the meeting

679
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:39,000
Alright, alright cheers. Ciao.

680
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,400
Mario is just a good fuck

681
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,600
I should have listened to my brother...

682
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,600
I should have been with Alex...

683
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:16,500
He really likes him

684
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:21,900
What did he say?

685
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:30,400
- He's okay
- Thats all we can say...

686
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:11,600
Why did you bring me here?

687
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:18,200
The manager isn't happy with your dance,

688
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,300
we can't keep you any more

689
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
but what am I gonna do?

690
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:36,700
I am not your Daddy,
but I could take care of you

691
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,400
are you asleep?

692
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,500
I would have already committed suicide

693
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:58,800
if I didn't have this sensation...
that Oscar is somewhere around me...

694
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:03,200
I wish he could come back to life...

695
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:11,600
Stop hurting yourself

696
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,900
I know its hard to lament

697
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
But dead... is dead

698
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:06,400
Please let us know if he gets his speech back

699
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:37,000
That thing is not my brother...

700
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:43,000
He's obviously not like how he was...

701
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,400
- That thing is fucking disgusting...
- Shut up!

702
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,500
Have you two decided where we going?

703
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,700
Have you two decided,
where the fuck we going?!

704
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,400
Theres...
theres no way I could put up with him

705
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,500
Don't fucking touch me!

706
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:34,700
Lets get the fuck outta here

707
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:46,900
Hey, wake up!

708
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:50,900
Hey, hey wake!

709
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:52,200
They burnt you didn't they?

710
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:56,600
They burnt you didn't they?

711
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:01,300
They torched you!

712
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,700
They torched you, c'mon think about it
Close your eyes and think about it

713
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,400
If your lucky you might find your ashes

714
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:17,300
Go on you little cunt!

715
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:23,400
Go on! Close your eyes think about it!
Go on!

716
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,800
- I ah...
- What?

717
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:11,400
I had another dream where my brother
resuscitated from the morgue

718
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:25,100
Isn't it creepy keeping his remains in that box

719
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:30,600
What you gonna do?

720
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:33,100
It's your fucking brother!

721
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:51,600
Those remains are not my brother

722
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:56,600
Do, what you want

723
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,400
Goodbye...

724
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:19,600
- Here you are!
- Thank you man!

725
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:21,100
- Are you okay?
- Oh...

726
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:23,800
- Shit...
- Thanks, you got cigarettes?

727
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:42,100
Okay I'm gonna need some money

728
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,000
Okay I ask Linda to bring it to you

729
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:46,300
She want to see you

730
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah

731
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,700
- Is she still with Mario?
- Yeah I think...

732
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Fuck

733
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:53,800
What do you want?

734
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,400
I want to say sorry

735
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:07,700
I want to say sorry, sorry

736
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:13,400
Thats what you keep hearing
the others saying?

737
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:17,800
- That your sorry?
- Yes - Really? - Yes

738
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:27,100
Why don't you go make yourself useful

739
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:29,400
and go kill yourself...

740
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:36,100
Yeah, why don't you go and make yourself useful

741
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:40,700
- and fucking go kill yourself
- You don't mean that

742
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:42,600
I do

743
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:49,700
You don't understand...
I mean It's partly my fault

744
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:53,700
From me and Oscar...
Go fucking kill yourself...

745
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:57,200
- You have to understand...
- You piece of SHIT!

746
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:02,800
Yeah but Oscar died dealing drugs because
you went with all these sleazy people

747
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:06,900
Because its me, because its my fucking fault?

748
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:08,600
- You piece of shit!
- Get the fuck outta here!

749
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:09,900
I hate you!

750
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:12,500
I hate you!

751
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:18,000
Fuck you! Fuck you!

752

You piece of shit! It's my fault?
Get the fuck out of my house!

753
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:30,900
Fuck you! Fuck you!

I wanna fucking die!

758

Fuck my older brother and his stupid fucking friends!

759

My life is fucked, my life is fucked!
My life is fucked!

760
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,700
I don't wanna be here

761
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:46,100
I don't wanna be here with these fucking evil,
evil fucking people!

762
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:48,700
They're fucking evil!

They're fucking evil

764
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:04,700
They're fucking evil people

765
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:17,200
I just wanna be alone

766
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:25,500
I just wanna be alone...

767
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,300
All you people are evil, fuck off!

768
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:38,700
I just wanna die...

769
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:51,200
Hey

770
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:01,600
Hey, Good to see you

771
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,500
Good to see you too

772
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:11,100
- How have you been?
- I've been better...

773
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:17,000
Me too

774
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:26,700
- I'm sorry about your brother
- It's okay...

775
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:42,300
WATCH OUT!

776
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:48,700
No! No! No! No!

777
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:08,300
Daddy! Mummy!

778
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,100
