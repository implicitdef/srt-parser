3
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:08,522
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

4
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:09,828
I will, Your Grace.

5
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:11,730
Did you see my brother when you
were the Starks' guest?

6
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,826
I did.

7
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:15,510
Tell him he's not
been forgotten.

8
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:21,974
I'll do it.

9
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:23,676
Come, brothers.
We'll leave him to it.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,511
Be quick about it.

11
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:30,317
I've yielded Winterfell
to Prince Theon.

12
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:32,419
All of you should do
as he commands.

Get back!

17
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:50,569
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

18
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:52,338
Your brothers desert you?

19
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:54,973
- We'll stop here.
- Think they're out looking for you?

20
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,275
Yes.

21

What might this be?
Let's go.

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,184
Amory Lorch.
Now!

23
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:07,253
A man will do
what must be done.

00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:22,569
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

Come on,

48
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:02,603
Halt!

49

Enjoying
your first hunt?

50
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:12,579
So far, hunting seems very similar
to riding, My Lord.

51
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,082
With hunting,
there's blood at the end.

52
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,049
They're little boys.

53
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,498
I was a little boy
when I was torn away from

54
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,452
my home and brought here.

55
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,053
So I kept my word.

56
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,022
I never ran away.

57
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,159
If I find them soon enough,
I won't hurt them.

58
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:30,230
Well, I'll hurt them,
but I won't kill them.

59
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,300
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

60
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,335
They have no value
to me missing.

61
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,905
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

62
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,142
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

63
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,878
<i>She'll get here</i>
<i>long before they do.</i>

64
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:46,562
And Ned Stark always
said 500 men could hold

65
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,182
Winterfell against 10,000.

66
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:51,118
<i>We have a scent!</i>

67
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:53,753
The hounds have the scent.

68
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,289
Come, Maester,
don't look so grim.

69
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,091
It's all just a game.

70
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,175
We should have
took more food.

71
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,344
We couldn't risk
going to the kitchens.

72
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,846
Those people
all love you.

73
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,281
They would have given
you whatever you needed.

74
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,150
And if Theon found out,
he'd hang them.

75
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:26,152
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

76
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,456
We've been walking
since before sunrise.

77
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,925
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

78
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,928
- Even you, sweet giant.
-  Hodor.

79
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,734
Wait, I know that farm.

80
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,569
<i>I sent those two</i>
<i>Winterfell orphans there.</i>

81
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,538
Jack and Billy.

82
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,306
They'll give us some food.

83
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,407
We can't risk it.

84
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,109
If Theon tracks us here,
he'll torture them

85
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:53,111
until he finds out
where we are.

86
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,547
Billy climbs a tree
better than anyone.

87
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,315
You've never seen me
climb a tree, little man.

88
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,851
<i>They'll be after us</i>
<i>with hounds.</i>

89
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,453
<i>We got a good start</i>
<i>on them,</i>

90
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,922
but we can't outrun
hounds forever.

91
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,051
Did you pull a knife
on me in the night?

92
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,761
What's the matter?

93
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,663
Can't be the first time
you pressed your bone

94
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,298
against a woman's ass.

95
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,268
Let's move.

96
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,443
Oh, it is
the first time.

97
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,680
How old are you, boy?

98
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:05,483
I'm a man
of the Night's Watch.

99
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,088
You're a boy who's
never been with a girl.

100
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,494
Don't your stones
start to hurt

101
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,097
if your bone
never gets--

102
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,232
Don't call them that.

103
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,569
What, stones?

104
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,271
Or bone?

105
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,707
Neither.

106
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,042
Both.

107
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,612
Move!

108
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,419
I heard they get
all swollen

109
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,788
and bruised if you
don't use them.

110
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,590
Of course, maybe that's
just what the lads say

111
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,259
when they want me
feeling sorry for them.

112
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,628
As if I'd feel
sorry for them.

113
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53,232
Are there
no girl crows?

114
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,035
There are no women
of the Night's Watch, no.

115
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,137
So the lads just do it
with each other?

116
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,039
No.

117
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,574
- Never?
- Never.

118
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:06,177
We swore an oath.

119
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,513
You have sheep
at the Wall?

120
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,717
With your hands, then?

121
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,888
No wonder
you're all so miserable.

122
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,390
Would you please shut up?

123
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,559
Would you please shut up?

124
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,129
You think you're
better than me, crow.

125
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,698
- I'm a free woman--
- You're a free woman?

126
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,001
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

127
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,969
If you're my prisoner,
you're not a free woman.

128
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,604
That's what
"prisoner" means.

129
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,706
And you think you're free?

130
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,709
You swore
some stupid oath

131
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,211
and now you can never
touch a girl.

132
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,713
It was my choice
to say the words.

133
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,615
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

134
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,617
But you chose
never to touch them.

135
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,354
That's the price you pay if you want
to be a man of the Night's Watch.

136
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,222
So instead of getting
naked with a girl,

137
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:50,791
you'd prefer
to invade our lands--

138
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:52,492
Invade your lands?

139
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,461
Wildlings raid
our lands all the time.

140
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:57,398
Some of them tried to kill my
little brother, a crippled boy!

141
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,401
They're not your lands!

142
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,470
We've been here
the whole time.

143
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:03,395
You lot came along
and just put up a big wall

144
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,074
and said it was yours.

145
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,710
My father was Ned Stark.

146
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,712
I have the blood
of the First Men.

147
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:12,982
My ancestors lived here,
same as yours.

148
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,420
So why are you
fighting us?

149
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:35,574
Go on.

150
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,149
Now I want you
to tell me what happened.

151
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:46,386
<i>- Come on, this way.</i>

152
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:50,022
<i>Come on, speak up.</i>
<i>Speak up.</i>

153
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:57,962
Wolfsbane--

154
00:10:57,996 --> 00:11:00,565
a rare substance.

155
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,033
This is no common assassin.

156
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:05,202
We hanged 20 men
last night.

157
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:08,038
I don't care
if you hanged 100.

158
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:09,573
A man tried to kill me.

159
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,642
I want his name
and I want his head.

160
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:13,144
<i>We think it was</i>
<i>an infiltrator</i>

161
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:16,014
from the Brotherhood
Without Banners.

162
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:18,817
Pretentious name
for a band of outlaws.

163
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:21,419
We can't allow rebels
behind our lines

164
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:23,522
to harass us
with impunity.

165
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,657
We look like fools
and they look like heroes.

166
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,425
<i>That's how kings fall.</i>

167
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,628
I want them dead,
every one.

168
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,429
Killing them
isn't the problem.

169
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:33,399
<i>It's finding them.</i>

170
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,701
Have you gone soft,
Clegane?

171
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,836
I always thought you had
a talent for violence.

172
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:41,473
Burn the villages,
burn the farms.

173
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:43,876
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

174
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,344
Mmm.

175
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,049
Is that mutton?

176
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,584
Yes, My Lord.

177
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:53,186
Don't like mutton.

178
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:56,155
I'll bring
something else.

179
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,291
Leave it.

180
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:01,827
- Are you hungry?
- No.

181
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:03,495
Of course you are.

182
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,063
Eat.

183
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:08,333
I'll eat
in the kitchen later.

184
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:12,537
It's bad manners
to refuse a Lord's offer.

185
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,673
Sit.

186
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:17,242
Eat.

187
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:21,779
You're small for your age.

188
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,416
I suppose you've been
underfed your whole life.

189
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,151
I eat a lot.

190
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:30,355
- <i>I just don't grow.</i>
- Hmm.

191
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,563
This will be my last war,

192
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:39,732
win or lose.

193
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,836
Have you ever
lost before?

194
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,873
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

195
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,551
But this is the one
I'll be remembered for.

196
00:12:56,585 --> 00:12:59,221
<i>The "War of Five Kings"</i>
<i>they're calling it.</i>

197
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,793
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

198
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:08,231
Do you know
what legacy means?

199
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:12,802
It's what you pass down
to your children

200
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:16,205
and your children's
children.

201
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,275
It's what remains of you
when you're gone.

202
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:26,182
Harren the Black thought this castle
would be his legacy.

203
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:30,553
The greatest fortress
ever built--

204
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:34,123
the tallest towers,
the strongest walls.

205
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:37,694
The Great Hall
had 35 hearths.

206
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:40,864
35. Can you imagine?

207
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,532
Look at it now--

208
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,535
<i>a blasted ruin.</i>

209
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,638
Do you know
what happened?

210
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:50,973
Dragons?

211
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:55,078
Yes, dragons happened.

212
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:02,018
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

213
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:07,289
A million men could have marched
on these walls

214
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,692
and a million men
would have been repelled.

215
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:15,330
But an attack from the air
with dragon fire-- mm.

216
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:18,766
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

217
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,737
Aegon Targaryen
changed the rules.

218
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:26,739
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

219
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:28,875
300 years after his death.

220
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,278
Aegon and his sisters.

221
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,880
Mm?

222
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,150
It wasn't just Aegon
riding his dragon.

223
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:39,019
It was Rhaenys
and Visenya, too.

224
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:41,322
Correct.

225
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,591
A student of history,
are you?

226
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,094
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

227
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:47,963
Visenya rode Vhagar.

228
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,267
I'm sure I knew that
when I was a boy.

229
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:56,606
Visenya Targaryen
was a great warrior.

230
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,542
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

231
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,878
Hmm.

232
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:04,081
She's a heroine
of yours, I take it?

233
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:06,983
Aren't most girls
more interested

234
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:08,952
in the pretty maidens
from the songs?

235
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:11,086
<i>Jonquil with the flowers</i>
<i>in her hair?</i>

236
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,589
- Most girls are idiots.
- <i>Ha!</i>

237
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,458
You remind me
of my daughter.

238
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,061
Where did you learn
all this stuff

239
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:24,098
about Visenya and her
Valyrian Steel sword?

240
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,001
From my father.

241
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:32,607
He was a well-read
stonemason.

242
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,912
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stonemason.

243
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,716
Have you met many
stonemasons, My Lord?

244
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:44,121
Careful now, girl.

245
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,357
<i>I enjoy you,</i>
<i>but be careful.</i>

246
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:49,226
Take that back
to the kitchen.

247
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,028
Eat what you want.

248
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:56,099
And, girl.

249
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,870
M'lord.

250
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:03,940
Lowborn girls
say "M'lord,"

251
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,343
<i>not "My Lord."</i>

252
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:08,612
If you're going
to pose as a commoner,

253
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,781
you should do it
properly.

254
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,917
My mother served
Lady Dustin

255
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:16,886
for many years,
My Lord.

256
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:20,390
She taught me how to speak
proper-- properly.

257
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:23,994
You're too smart
for your own good.

258
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:27,230
- <i>Has anyone told you that?</i>
- Yes.

259
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,933
Go on.

260
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:44,580
I beg pardon, Ser.

261
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:46,916
I should have
come to you after

262
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,252
to thank you
for saving me.

263
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:51,621
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

264
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:55,191
A dog doesn't need courage
to chase off rats.

265
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:57,993
Does it give you joy
to scare people?

266
00:16:58,027 --> 00:17:00,930
No. It gives me joy
to kill people.

267
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:03,231
Spare me.
You can't tell me

268
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:06,234
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

269
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:09,437
It was his duty.
He never liked it.

270
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,539
Is that what he told you?

271
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,007
He lied.

272
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,977
Killing is the sweetest
thing there is.

273
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:19,645
Why are you always
so hateful?

274
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,447
You'll be glad
of the hateful things I do

275
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:24,250
someday when you're queen
and I'm all that stands

276
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,753
between you
and your beloved king.

277
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:37,999
I've demanded a meeting
of the Thirteen.

278
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:39,834
One of them did this
or knows who did.

279
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,436
You are one
of the Thirteen.

280
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,505
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

281
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,808
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

282
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:49,444
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

283
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:52,213
Shall we look inside my vault and see
what selling your dragons

284
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,215
would buy me
I cannot buy already?

285
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,383
We will get them back.

286
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,251
There is no we,

287
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,787
so why would you help me
get them back?

288
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:02,588
I took you
under my protection

289
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,690
in front of the rulers
of my city.

290
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,760
A man is what others
say he is and no more.

291
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,397
If they say that
Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,

292
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:12,867
my word is worth nothing.

293
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:15,470
I cannot let this thing
happen to you under my roof.

294
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:17,873
But it did happen
under your roof.

295
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:21,476
Khaleesi, many times
in my life I have been--

296
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:23,245
I don't care
where you've been.

297
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:50,102
You think we're savages because
we don't live in stone castles.

298
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:54,073
We can't make steel as good
as yours, it's true, but...

299
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:56,642
We're free.

300
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,469
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down

301
00:18:58,494 --> 00:18:59,946
as man and woman,

302
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:02,515
we'd shove a spear
up his ass.

303
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,484
We don't go serving
some shit king

304
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,085
who's only king
because his father was.

305
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,523
No. No, you serve
Mance Rayder,

306
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:10,957
the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

307
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:13,894
We chose Mance Rayder
to lead us.

308
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,297
He was a crow,
same as you,

309
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:18,599
but he wanted
to be free.

310
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,105
You could be free, too.

311
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:24,739
You don't need to live
your whole life

312
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:26,974
taking commands
from old men.

313
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:29,977
Wake up when you want
to wake up.

314
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:32,913
I could show you the streams
to fish, the woods to hunt.

315
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:37,149
<i>Build yourself a cabin and find</i>
<i>a woman to lie with in the night.</i>

316
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:40,752
You're a pretty lad.

317
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:44,155
The girls would claw each other's
eyes out to get naked with you.

318
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,294
Walk.

319
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,597
I could teach you
how to do it.

320
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,833
I know how to do it.

321
00:19:57,303 --> 00:20:00,673
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

322
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,136
And what did she say?

323
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:33,805
She admired your spirit,
Your Grace.

324
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,840
And what then?

325
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:40,012
She, uh...

326
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:42,014
If every man
were held accountable

327
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,016
for the actions
of every distant relative,

328
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,219
Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

329
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:53,592
She tore the paper
in half, Your Grace.

330
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,127
You've acted with honor.

331
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:57,229
I thank you for it.

332
00:20:57,263 --> 00:21:00,299
Lord Karstark, see that
Ser Alton's pen is clean.

333
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,800
And give him a hot supper.

334
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:04,304
Ser Alton's pen
is occupied, Your Grace.

335
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:06,873
The prisoners
from the Yellow Fork.

336
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:08,942
Too many prisoners.

337
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,712
Is there room
for Ser Alton?

338
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:14,949
Does he need
to lie down?

339
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,221
Have the men
build him a new pen.

340
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:21,890
<i>Put him in with</i>
<i>the Kingslayer for now.</i>

341
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:24,093
Have your boy
watch over them.

342
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:26,762
Torrhen.

343
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:28,430
That will be all.

344
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,637
Your Grace.

345
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,906
<i>A minute of your time?</i>

346
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:55,357
I've been treating
your wounded men.

347
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:58,003
And my enemies
as some of my bannermen

348
00:21:58,028 --> 00:21:59,695
are fond of mentioning.

349
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:01,330
They're not my enemies.

350
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,466
That's what I tell
my bannermen.

351
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,202
I've already run through the
supplies I brought with me.

352
00:22:06,236 --> 00:22:07,636
Some are easily replaced--

353
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:10,639
egg yolks, turpentine,
oil of roses.

354
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:13,075
But some are not.

355
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:16,177
I need silk
for stitching.

356
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:20,448
I need fennel root
for those with fever, willow bark.

357
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:22,683
Mostly I need
milk of the poppy.

358
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,886
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

359
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,933
I assume there will be
more loss of limb before

360
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,523
this war is over.

361
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:33,561
- If you need help finding these--
- I know where to find them.

362
00:22:34,697 --> 00:22:37,399
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
interrupt you.

363
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,736
Continue, My Lady.

364
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:45,803
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

365
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,718
Yes.

366
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:51,281
The Crag will have a Maester
and he will have what I need.

367
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:53,482
I expect he will.

368
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,451
If I could write a list--

369
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:57,886
come with me
to the Crag.

370
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:01,022
I don't think
that will be--

371
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:03,358
Let the Maester
show you his stores.

372
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:07,528
I want the wounded men
to be treated well--

373
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,464
all the wounded men.

374
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:19,541
<i>Children, come inside, quick.</i>

375
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:21,744
Hurry up!

376
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:24,947
<i>Can't find anything, Ser.</i>

377
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:27,817
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

378
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:29,419
We've circled
this farmhouse twice.

379
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:31,054
There's no sign of them.

380
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:34,958
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, My Lord.

381
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:36,894
I'm looking at spending
the rest of life

382
00:23:36,928 --> 00:23:39,864
being treated like a fool and
a eunuch by my own people.

383
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,899
Ask yourself, "Is there anything
I wouldn't do

384
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,501
to stop that
from happening?"

385
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,703
The hounds will find
the scent again.

386
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:48,005
I'll beat them
until they do.

387
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,406
I'll whip every man here

388
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,908
<i>until I have</i>
<i>both those boys in hand.</i>

389
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:54,910
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

390
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:58,780
It's better to be
cruel than weak.

391
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,048
Prince Theon.

392
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,217
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

393
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:04,451
The Stark boys.
Where are they?

394
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,720
I don't know.
I seen no one.

395
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:08,656
Oh!

396
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,124
Think harder.

397
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,329
I swear, m'lord,
I don't know.

398
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:17,266
My Lord, over here.

399
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,739
I think I've found
what we're looking for.

400
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:34,784
Send the old man home.

401
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,656
Go back to Winterfell.

402
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:43,525
Take him back.

403
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:48,263
Theon, don't do this.

404
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:08,483
You came back.

405
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:10,618
As soon as I heard.

406
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:13,221
Do you know anything?

407
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:16,291
- Irri is dead.
- <i>I know.</i>

408
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,528
- She was a good--
- she's dead.

409
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:21,330
She died alone.

410
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:23,832
She died for me
and I couldn't protect her.

411
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:26,602
Doreah?

412
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,671
We can't find her.

413
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:32,808
She must be dead, too.

414
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:34,977
I led my people
out of the Red Waste

415
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:36,579
and into
the slaughterhouse.

416
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:38,682
I should have been here.

417
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:42,052
You went to find me
a ship.

418
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:44,254
My place is by your side.

419
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,656
I shouldn't have left you
alone with these people.

420
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:48,324
These people?

421
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,826
They are not
to be trusted.

422
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,495
And who is to be trusted?

423
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,096
Who are my people?

424
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:57,332
The Targaryens?

425
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:59,234
I only knew one--
my brother,

426
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,469
and he would have let
1,000 men rape me

427
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:03,571
if it had got him
the crown.

428
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,206
The Dothraki?

429
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,429
Most of them turned on me
the day that Khal Drogo

430
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:08,910
fell from his horse.

431
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:10,678
Your people
are in Westeros.

432
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:13,414
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

433
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,483
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

434
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:17,719
They'll pray for my return?

435
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:20,222
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

436
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:23,393
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

437
00:26:23,427 --> 00:26:25,862
You are not your brother.

438
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:28,464
Trust me, Khaleesi.

439
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,633
There it is--

440
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:32,902
"trust me."

441
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:35,538
And it's you I should trust,
Ser Jorah?

442
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:37,506
Only you?

443
00:26:40,243 --> 00:26:43,645
I don't need trust
any longer.

444
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,514
I don't want it and I don't have
room for it.

445
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,683
You are too young
to be so--

446
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:50,919
And you are too familiar.

447
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,826
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

448
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:02,532
No one can survive
in this world without help.

449
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:04,000
No one.

450
00:27:04,035 --> 00:27:06,637
Let me help you, please.

451
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:09,439
Tell me how.

452
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,742
Find my dragons.

453
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:23,320
How long till we get
back to your crows?

454
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,456
We're close.

455
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:29,994
What, a day?
A half-day?

456
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:36,600
You don't know, do you?

457
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:39,537
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

458
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:43,541
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

459
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:45,644
Nothing happened
between you and me.

460
00:27:45,678 --> 00:27:49,048
"I swear it,
old master king crow, Ser,

461
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,817
we were only close
together for warmth.

462
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:53,453
And then I felt it,

463
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:56,189
right up against
me backside like a club.

464
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:58,691
I can show you the bruise
on me tailbone.

465
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:02,161
And before I knew
what was where, his-- his--

466
00:28:02,196 --> 00:28:05,131
well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

467
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:09,202
And I didn't want to want it,
but, oh, I did!

468
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:12,204
And he spread me legs
and-- ruined.

469
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:13,906
The shame of it.

470
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:16,075
Now I can never marry
a perfumed lord.

471
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,805
What will me poor
savage father say?"

472
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,779
Turn back around.

473
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,915
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

474
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,685
'Turn back around.'"

475
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,387
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

476
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,523
since it's going to be
your word against mine,

477
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:33,426
and since you can't talk
about it without blushing,

478
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,530
we may as well just.

479
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,599
What, right here
in the muck?

480
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,835
I'll keep you
warm enough.

481
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,906
Are you that afraid
of it?

482
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,441
That's enough.

483
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,910
Oh, it's nice

484
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:52,979
and wet and warm.

485
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,815
Enough

486
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,718
it don't have teeth.

487
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:07,027
All right!

488
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:09,529
All right.

489
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,598
Gods, you're dull.

490
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:51,271
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

491
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:03,886
<i>No, no!</i>

492
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:26,439
No. Oh, no.

493
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,592
It's all right.
Give me that.

494
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:48,863
If the queen sees I can have
Joffrey's children now...

495
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,632
Help me flip it over.

496
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:10,183
- Where are you going?
- To tell her Grace.

497
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,187
You'll say nothing
to anyone.

498
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,322
Do you understand?

499
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,813
Your mother might have
prepared you.

500
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:42,216
You flowered, my dear.
No more.

501
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,419
My mother told me, but I
thought it would be different.

502
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,954
In what way?

503
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,158
I thought
it would be less--

504
00:31:50,193 --> 00:31:53,295
less messy.

505
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,098
Wait until you bear
the child.

506
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:59,235
You're a woman now.

507
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:02,338
Do you have any idea
what that means?

508
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:04,874
I'm fit to bear children
for the king?

509
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:07,344
A prospect that
once delighted you--

510
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:09,813
bringing little princes
and princesses into the world,

511
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:13,549
the greatest honor
for a queen.

512
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:20,922
Joffrey has always
been difficult.

513
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,057
Even his birth,
I labored a day and a half

514
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,159
to bring him
into this world.

515
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,628
You cannot imagine
the pain.

516
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:29,564
I screamed so loudly,
I was sure

517
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:31,066
Robert would hear me
in the Kingswood.

518
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,135
His Grace was not
with you?

519
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:35,670
Robert was hunting.

520
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,573
That was his custom.

521
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,912
Whenever my time was near,

522
00:32:42,947 --> 00:32:45,549
my royal husband
would flee to the trees

523
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:50,420
with his huntsmen
and his hounds.

524
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:51,988
And when he returned,
he would present me

525
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:55,224
with some pelts
or a stag's head,

526
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:57,125
and I would present him
with a baby.

527
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,563
Not that I wanted
him there, mind you.

528
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,632
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives,

529
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,634
and I had my brother.

530
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:10,005
When they told Jaime he wasn't
allowed in the birthing room,

531
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,375
he smiled and asked
which one of them

532
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,543
proposed to keep him out.

533
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,217
Joffrey will show you
no such devotion.

534
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:26,156
You may never
love the king,

535
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,057
but you will love
his children.

536
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:31,461
I love his Grace
with all my heart.

537
00:33:31,495 --> 00:33:34,363
That's so very
touching to hear.

538
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:41,136
Permit me to share
some womanly wisdom with you

539
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,172
on this very special day.

540
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:48,008
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

541
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:51,612
You'll do things for them that
you know you shouldn't do.

542
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:55,349
You'll act the fool to make them
happy, to keep them safe.

543
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,587
Love no one
but your children.

544
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:04,190
On that front,
a mother has no choice.

545
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:08,862
But... shouldn't
I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

546
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:14,034
You can try,

547
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:16,037
little dove.

548
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:34,556
Who did you say
your mother was again?

549
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,357
Cinda Lannister.

550
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:38,159
Is she the fat one?

551
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,928
Well, perhaps she's gotten
a little larger than she--

552
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:44,731
No, no. There's only one
fat Lannister.

553
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:47,635
If she was your mother,
you'd know it.

554
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:52,440
I-- I squired
for you once, you know?

555
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:55,076
When?

556
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,513
The tournament the day
of Willem Frey's wedding.

557
00:34:58,548 --> 00:35:01,584
I went to
Willem Frey's wedding?

558
00:35:01,618 --> 00:35:03,419
<i>You did.</i>

559
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:05,888
Your squire had gotten
so drunk the night before that he--

560
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,057
He threw up on his horse

561
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:09,625
on the way
to the tourney grounds.

562
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:12,194
- What was his name?
- Bryan.

563
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:15,396
Poor lad.

564
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:18,433
That was my brother's doing,
I seem to recall.

565
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:22,803
I remember you.

566
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:25,705
You had never squired
for anyone before.

567
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:27,674
That's right.
I ran up and volunteered.

568
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,077
"Let me, My Lord.
Let me."

569
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:33,546
My father was furious,

570
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,315
afraid I'd embarrass
our family

571
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,783
in front of <i>the</i> family.

572
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,353
You didn't, though.

573
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:43,855
- You really remember?
- Mm.

574
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,391
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away.

575
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:47,959
It's a rare talent.

576
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:51,762
Most of my squires,
they mean well,

577
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:55,233
but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

578
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,134
Well, when I think
back to that day--

579
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:08,945
You were saying?

580
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:11,382
I--

581
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,318
never mind.
It's embarrassing.

582
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:17,055
More embarrassing
than being chained to a post

583
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:18,857
covered in your own shit?

584
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:22,862
I remember everything
about that day--

585
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:25,231
your helmet, your horse,

586
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,967
the rake line in the dirt
along the list,

587
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,469
where the sun was
in the sky

588
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:31,704
when you knocked
Balon Swann from his horse,

589
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:34,941
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

590
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,912
I'll remember it all
until I die.

591
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,449
That was the best day
of my life.

592
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:50,389
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

593
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:51,891
All the competitors
were done.

594
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:53,927
I was the last one
out there.

595
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,698
And I couldn't leave.

596
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,001
<i>I couldn't bring myself</i>
<i>to go and sit with my family</i>

597
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:03,203
at a table so far
on the edge of the feast

598
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:05,572
you could barely
even see the bride.

599
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:08,040
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you

600
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,557
when I knew that they could
never have the faintest idea

601
00:37:10,582 --> 00:37:11,873
what I was talking about.

602
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:15,849
I understand completely.

603
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:18,919
How could you?

604
00:37:18,954 --> 00:37:21,856
S-sorry, I-- I didn't
mean to doubt you.

605
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,392
- It's just that I--
- I was 16 once.

606
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:28,896
I also had to replace someone's
squire on short notice.

607
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,598
Which knight was it?

608
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:33,400
Barristan Selmy.

609
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:36,670
The fight against
the Kingswood outlaws.

610
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:39,373
Before your time.

611
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,908
What was he like?

612
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:47,148
He was

613
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,017
a painter,

614
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:53,354
a painter
who only used red.

615
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:59,928
I couldn't imagine being
able to fight like that,

616
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:02,164
not back then.

617
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,554
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something

618
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:06,579
that perfect...

619
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:11,374
I don't need to explain
how that felt, not to you.

620
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,077
It's hard to put
into words.

621
00:38:14,111 --> 00:38:17,247
It's like stepping
into a dream

622
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:20,450
you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember

623
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:22,319
and finding out
that the dream

624
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:25,389
is more real
than your life.

625
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:30,929
Leaving
that battlefield was

626
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:33,064
like being dragged off
to prison.

627
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:36,468
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

628
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:40,239
I didn't have your gift.

629
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:43,610
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

630
00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:46,946
I was awful,
a complete liability...

631
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,583
until one of the outlaws

632
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:54,186
decided to take on
a 16-year-old squire.

633
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,426
It's a good thing
I am who I am.

634
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:06,130
I'd have been useless
at anything else.

635
00:39:10,703 --> 00:39:13,771
I'm not well-suited
for imprisonment.

636
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,507
Shocking, I know.

637
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,242
Some men are.

638
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:20,779
Ned Stark--
I imagine he made

639
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:24,250
an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

640
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:27,753
But me, though--
my life has left me

641
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:30,823
uniquely unfit
for constraint.

642
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:33,992
Have you thought about...?

643
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:35,627
Of course.

644
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:38,530
- Every day.
- And?

645
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:44,702
Good prisoners breed
good jailers, apparently.

646
00:39:44,736 --> 00:39:46,871
The Starks
are very careful.

647
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:52,210
But there is a way,
I think.

648
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:54,880
It wasn't possible
until now.

649
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:58,117
What is it?

650
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:05,225
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

651
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,061
You'll only have
to do one thing.

652
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:09,963
Tell me.

653
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,668
You'll have to die.

654
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:10,489
Jorah the Andal.

655
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:13,625
This man must sail
past old Valyria.

656
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:17,963
All who travel too close to
the Doom must have protection.

657
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,898
I didn't come here
for lessons.

658
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:22,201
No, you came
for the dragons.

659
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:24,303
You have them?

660
00:41:25,505 --> 00:41:27,473
Where are they?

661
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:29,508
Draw your sword.

662
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:33,211
See what your steel
is worth.

663
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,818
You want to please
the Mother of Dragons.

664
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:47,225
You love her.

665
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:52,330
Where are the dragons?

666
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,234
Will you betray her again,
Jorah the Andal?

667
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:03,641
Will you betray her again?

668
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:07,512
Never.

669
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:15,518
<i>The thief you seek</i>

670
00:42:15,553 --> 00:42:18,520
is with her now.

671
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:25,293
<i>I did not leave</i>
<i>the comfort of my home</i>

672
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:27,094
to come to yours
and be called a thief.

673
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,063
No one is calling you
a thief.

674
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:30,798
Who is she to accuse us?

675
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,834
Please,
they're my children.

676
00:42:32,868 --> 00:42:35,136
- I'm begging you.
- Begging us?

677
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,605
It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

678
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,341
Without me,
the dragons will die.

679
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:42,443
It will be
for the best.

680
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:44,746
<i>Your dragons</i>
<i>will bring the world</i>

681
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,549
nothing but death
and misery, my dear.

682
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,985
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

683
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:51,954
<i>You are cruel, my friend.</i>

684
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:54,957
The mother of dragons
is in the right.

685
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:58,128
<i>She must be reunited</i>
<i>with her babies.</i>

686
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:02,032
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

687
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:05,736
I will take you
to the House of the Undying

688
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:07,738
where I have put them.

689
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,908
You have my dragons?

690
00:43:10,942 --> 00:43:13,211
When I learned you were
coming to our city,

691
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:15,947
I made an arrangement
with the King of Qarth.

692
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:19,383
He procured them for me.

693
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:22,387
- But there is no King of Qarth.
- There is now.

694
00:43:22,421 --> 00:43:24,622
That was the other half
of the arrangement.

695
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:29,928
<i>You would keep your gates</i>
<i>and your minds closed</i>

696
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:33,099
to everything
outside your walls,

697
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:36,235
but Qarth cannot remain
the greatest city that ever was

698
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,904
if it refuses to change.

699
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:40,574
I will open Qarth
to the world

700
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:44,879
as I have forced it
to open itself to me.

701
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,848
Your ambition
is an inspiration.

702
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:50,918
But like all upstarts,
you overreach.

703
00:43:50,952 --> 00:43:53,687
Three dragons
the size of cats

704
00:43:53,722 --> 00:43:56,023
and an alliance
with a charlatan

705
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:58,559
do not make you a king.

706
00:43:58,593 --> 00:44:00,794
An upstart
and a charlatan?

707
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:03,864
<i>Empires have been</i>
<i>built by less.</i>

708
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:07,334
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

709
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:09,702
and those in the center
make room for them,

710
00:44:09,737 --> 00:44:11,437
<i>willingly or otherwise.</i>

711
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:19,144
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

712
00:44:20,713 --> 00:44:22,247
She will give them
her love

713
00:44:22,282 --> 00:44:25,050
and they will thrive
by her side...

714
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:29,287
forever.

715
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:51,645
A mother should be
with her children.

716
00:44:54,783 --> 00:44:57,452
Where will you run to,
Daenerys Stormborn?

717
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,789
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

718
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,126
Come see them.

719
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:14,271
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

720
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:16,039
Keep your hands
off me, woman.

721
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:19,743
Don't enter without
an invitation, <i>man.</i>

722
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:23,213
Forgive me.
Lady Stark.

723
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:25,916
<i>- What is it?</i>
- They caught the Kingslayer.

724
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,524
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
- Hang him!

725
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:40,030
You'll die today.

726
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:42,532
Justice for
the Karstark.

727
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,315
Gut him!

728
00:46:09,861 --> 00:46:12,230
Get back!
I want his head!

729
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:15,900
Any man who stands
between a father

730
00:46:15,934 --> 00:46:18,436
and his vengeance
asks for death.

731
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,705
Lord Karstark,

732
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,641
this man
is our prisoner.

733
00:46:23,675 --> 00:46:25,576
This monster
killed my son.

734
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:27,646
And crippled mine.

735
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,447
He will answer
for his crimes,

736
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:31,515
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>but not here.</i>

737
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,852
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me--

738
00:46:33,886 --> 00:46:36,287
You will strike me down?

739
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:38,623
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

740
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:40,725
<i>I am the widow of your</i>
<i>liege Lord Eddark Stark.</i>

741
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:42,260
I am the mother
of your king!

742
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:45,129
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

743
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:47,299
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

744
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:51,069
Aye, gone to the Crag,
but not to negotiate.

745
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:53,004
He brought that
foreign bitch with him.

746
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:53,846
How dare you?

747
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:55,992
Threatening My Lady
is an act of treason.

748
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:57,276
Treason?

749
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,078
How can it be treason
to kill Lannisters?

750
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,180
I understand
your grief, My Lord--

751
00:47:01,215 --> 00:47:03,649
better than most
I understand it--

752
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:06,619
but in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

753
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:08,688
stand down.

754
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:11,991
When your son returns,

755
00:47:12,026 --> 00:47:14,427
<i>I will demand</i>
<i>this murderer's head.</i>

756
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:16,696
Wise men do not
make demands of kings.

757
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,932
Fathers who love
their sons do.

758
00:47:19,966 --> 00:47:22,301
I will have his head.

759
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:27,706
Thank you for fighting
on my behalf, Lady Stark.

760
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,574
I would have come
to your defense, but--

761
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:32,276
Take him to the stockades.

762
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:34,512
Bind him with every chain
you can find!

763
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:36,046
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

764
00:47:36,081 --> 00:47:38,249
There's not much fish
left in you.

765
00:47:38,283 --> 00:47:39,984
And gag him!

766
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:47,357
Since when do you light
your own candles?

767
00:47:47,391 --> 00:47:49,726
Since I decided that
I can't stand to look

768
00:47:49,761 --> 00:47:53,296
at any of my handmaidens
for another instant.

769
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,768
How many times can you
read one raven scroll?

770
00:47:57,802 --> 00:48:01,472
Stannis Baratheon's fleet
has been spotted sailing north

771
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:04,142
past Tarth-- 200 ships.

772
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:08,313
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

773
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:10,715
He'll be at our gates
within five days,

774
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:12,450
four if he has the wind.

775
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:15,220
We have strong,
high walls.

776
00:48:15,254 --> 00:48:18,323
We'll rain fire
down on them from above.

777
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:20,492
"Rain fire on them
from above."

778
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,360
You're quoting father,
aren't you?

779
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:23,828
Why not?

780
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:25,763
He has a good mind
for strategy, doesn't he?

781
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:28,566
We call it tactics,
not strategy.

782
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,735
But, yes, he does have
a good mind for it.

783
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:32,604
The best mind,
some would say.

784
00:48:32,638 --> 00:48:34,606
Sadly, he's not here.

785
00:48:35,574 --> 00:48:37,909
It's just you,
me, and Joffrey,

786
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:40,111
the Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms

787
00:48:40,146 --> 00:48:41,913
and protector of the realm.

788
00:48:43,683 --> 00:48:45,383
I'm sure you'll make
a point eventually.

789
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:48,786
He needs to start
acting like a king.

790
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:51,989
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

791
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:54,325
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead--

792
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:56,627
I'm not the one giving
the boy whores to abuse.

793
00:48:56,661 --> 00:48:58,762
I thought the girls
might help him.

794
00:48:58,796 --> 00:49:01,197
- Did you?
- <i>I was wrong.</i>

795
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:06,501
If we can't
control him...

796
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:08,136
Do you think
I haven't tried?

797
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,375
He doesn't listen to me.

798
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:18,113
It's hard to put
a leash on a dog

799
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:20,882
once you've put
a crown on its head.

800
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,921
I always hoped
he'd be like Jaime.

801
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:31,226
He looks like him...

802
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:36,966
in a certain light.

803
00:49:39,303 --> 00:49:41,305
The boy is more
Robert than Jaime.

804
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:45,309
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

805
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:50,414
Sometimes I wonder...

806
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:52,849
What?

807
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:56,286
If this is the price

808
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,656
for what we've done,
for our sins.

809
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,725
Sins?

810
00:50:02,759 --> 00:50:04,293
The Targaryens--

811
00:50:04,327 --> 00:50:05,906
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years,

812
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:07,931
I know.

813
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:13,202
That's what Jaime and I would say to
each other in our moments of doubt.

814
00:50:13,237 --> 00:50:17,207
It's what I told Ned Stark when he
was stupid enough to confront me.

815
00:50:19,177 --> 00:50:22,380
Half the Targaryens
went mad, didn't they?

816
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:23,815
What's the saying?

817
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:28,386
Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin.

818
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,922
You've beaten the odds.

819
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:33,557
Tommen and Myrcella
are good, decent children,

820
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:35,426
both of them.

821
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:05,686
- Why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.

822
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:08,489
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

823
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,691
So is saving
Lannisters, yeah?

824
00:51:10,725 --> 00:51:13,493
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

825
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,029
Your son returns
at dawn, My Lady?

826
00:51:16,064 --> 00:51:17,631
So they say.

827
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:20,501
<i>The Kingslayer</i>
<i>won't last the night.</i>

828
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,869
<i>The more they drink,</i>
<i>the angrier they'll get.</i>

829
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:26,272
And when the Karstarks
draw their swords...

830
00:51:26,307 --> 00:51:29,742
<i>who wants to die</i>
<i>defending a Lannister?</i>

831
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:32,346
Come.

832
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:50,632
I need to be alone
with him.

833
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:54,536
- My Lady, our orders--
- your orders, which I just gave you,

834
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,138
are to leave me
alone with him.

835
00:52:02,044 --> 00:52:04,278
Come to say goodbye,
Lady Stark?

836
00:52:04,313 --> 00:52:09,117
I believe it's my last night
in this world.

837
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:10,585
Is that a woman?

838
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,388
Do you hear them
out there?

839
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:16,058
They want your head.

840
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:19,561
Well, old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

841
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,831
You strangled his son
with your chains.

842
00:52:22,866 --> 00:52:25,134
Oh, oh.

843
00:52:25,201 --> 00:52:26,802
Was he the one
on guard duty?

844
00:52:29,406 --> 00:52:31,207
He was in my way.

845
00:52:31,241 --> 00:52:32,841
Any Knight would have
done the same.

846
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:35,044
You are no Knight.

847
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:37,647
You have forsaken
every vow you ever took.

848
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:39,448
So many vows.

849
00:52:39,483 --> 00:52:41,250
They make you swear
and swear.

850
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:44,085
<i>Defend the king,</i>
<i>obey the king,</i>

851
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,654
<i>obey your father,</i>

852
00:52:45,688 --> 00:52:48,957
protect the innocent,
defend the weak.

853
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:52,827
But what if your father
despises the king?

854
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:56,464
What if the king
massacres the innocent?

855
00:52:56,498 --> 00:52:58,700
It's too much.

856
00:52:58,734 --> 00:53:02,270
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

857
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,139
Where did you find
this beast?

858
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:09,377
She is a truer Knight
than you will ever be,

859
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:11,713
Kingslayer.

860
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:14,349
Kingslayer.

861
00:53:14,383 --> 00:53:16,684
What a king he was.

862
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,389
<i>Here's to Aerys Targaryen,</i>
<i>the second of his name,</i>

863
00:53:20,423 --> 00:53:23,592
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the realm,

864
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:27,597
and to the sword
I shoved in his back.

865
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:31,834
You are a man
without honor.

866
00:53:33,203 --> 00:53:35,338
Do you know

867
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:38,608
I've never been with
any woman but Cersei?

868
00:53:38,642 --> 00:53:41,477
So in my own way,

869
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:46,650
I have more honor
than poor old dead Ned.

870
00:53:48,286 --> 00:53:50,521
What was the name of that
bastard so in he fathered?

871
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:54,159
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

872
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:58,363
Snow, a bastard
from the North.

873
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:01,167
Now, when--
when good old Ned

874
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:04,604
came home with
some whore's baby,

875
00:54:04,638 --> 00:54:07,807
did you pretend
to love it?

876
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:12,011
<i>No. You're not very good</i>
<i>at pretending.</i>

877
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:14,213
<i>You're an honest woman.</i>

878
00:54:14,247 --> 00:54:17,616
You hated that boy,
didn't you?

879
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:20,085
<i>How could you not</i>
<i>hate him?</i>

880
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:22,720
<i>The walking,</i>
<i>talking reminder</i>

881
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:26,423
that the honorable
Lord Eddark Stark

882
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:29,193
fucked another woman.

883
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,831
Your sword.

884
00:54:38,204 --> 00:54:41,541
I told you
what would happen.

885
00:54:41,575 --> 00:54:43,843
All of you--

886
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,816
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally...

887
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:52,019
<i>and what would happen</i>
<i>if you did not.</i>

888
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:54,888
What are you doing?
What have you done?

889
00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:57,123
If there's any who still question
whether your new lord

890
00:54:57,158 --> 00:54:58,792
means what he says...

891
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:04,431
Here is the answer
to your question.

892
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:15,977
No!

893
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:33,350
