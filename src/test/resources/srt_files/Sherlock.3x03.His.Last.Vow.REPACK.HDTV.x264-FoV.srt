1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,080
Mr Magnussen, please state your
full name for the record.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,040
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,960
Mr Magnussen,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,160
how would you describe your
influence over the Prime Minister?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,720
The British Prime Minister?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,800
Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,960
I never had the slightest
influence over any of them.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,440
Why would I?

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,520
I notice you've had seven meetings
at Downing Street this year.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,320
Why?

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,920
Because I was invited.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,720
Can you recall the subjects
under discussion?

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,400
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,880
Do you think it right that
a newspaper proprietor,

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,640
a private individual,
and in fact a foreign national,

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,160
should have such regular access
to our Prime Minister?

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,800
I don't think it's wrong that
a private individual should

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,760
accept an invitation.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,160
However, you have my sincere
apologies for being foreign.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,240
That's not what I meant. That is
not in any way...

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,360
Mr Magnussen,
can you recall an occasion

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,920
when your remarks could have
influenced government policy?

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,600
Or the Prime Minister's
thinking in any way?

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,480
No.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
Are you sure?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,160
I have an excellent memory.

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,360
PROJECTOR WHIRS

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
Your car is waiting outside...
See you tomorrow.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,720
May I join you?

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,760
I don't think it's appropriate.

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,600
It isn't. Mr Magnussen, outside the
inquiry, we can have no contact,

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,040
no communication at all.

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,360
Please don't do that.

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,400
In 1982, your husband corresponded
with Helen Catherine Driscoll.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
That was before I knew him.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,360
The letters were lively, loving...

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,320
some would say explicit.

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,480
And currently in my possession.

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
Will you please move your hand?

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,320
"I long, my darling, to know
the touch of your... body."

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I know what was in the letters.

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,760
She was 15.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,480
She looked older.

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,240
Oh, she looked delicious.
We have photographs too.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
The ones she sent him.

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,720
Yum-yum.

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,680
He was unaware of her age.

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
He met her only
once before the letters began.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,720
When he discovered the truth,
he stopped immediately.

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,440
Those are the facts.

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,200
Facts are for history books.
I work in news.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,880
Your hand is sweating.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,640
Always, I'm afraid.
I have a condition.

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,960
It's disgusting.

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm used to it.

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,800
The whole world is wet to my touch.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,680
I will call someone,
I will have you removed.

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
What is that?

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,720
Claire de la Lune?

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,560
A bit young for you, isn't it?

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,120
You want to hit me now?
Could you, still?

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
Little old lady now.

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,720
Perhaps you should
settle for calling someone.

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, go on.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
No?

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,360
Because now there are consequences.

68
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
I have the letters
and therefore I have you.

69
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,440
This is blackmail.

70
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Of course it isn't blackmail.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,320
This is...

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
ownership.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,520
You do not own me.

74
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,720
Claire de la Lune.

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,160
It never tastes like it smells,
does it?

76
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,720
Lady Smallwood's bill is on me.
See to it.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,120
Yes, Mr Magnussen.

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,160
SHE SHUDDERS

79
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,320
Oh, God! Oh!

80
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
You all right, ma'am?

81
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,040
Fine, yes.

82
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,840
Magnussen!

83
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,800
No-one stands up to him.

84
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,120
No-one dares, no-one even tries.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,160
There isn't a man or woman
in England capable of stopping

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,760
that disgusting creature...

87
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Ma'am?

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,480
Turn the car around. We're going
back into town. Turn around.

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
Where are we going, ma'am?

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
Baker Street.

91
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,640
RAPID GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS

92
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,200
'You've seen a lot of injuries,
then? Violent deaths?'

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,600
'Enough for a lifetime.'
'Want to see some more?'

94
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,160
'Oh, God, yes.'

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,120
KNOCKING ON DOOR

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
'The game is on.'

97
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
KNOCKING CONTINUES

98
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,000
I know it's early.
Really, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
WOMAN SOBS

100
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Is that Kate?
Yeah, it's Kate.

101
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,560
Invite her in?

102
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Er, sorry, yes,
do you want to come in, Kate?

103
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,200
Hey!

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,520
It's hard.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
There you go. It's Isaac.
Oh, your husband? Son. Son, yeah.

106
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,760
He's gone missing again.
Didn't come home last night.

107
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,000
The usual.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,880
He's the drugs one, yeah?

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,000
Er, yeah, nicely put, John.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,960
But is it Sherlock Holmes you want?
Because I've not seen him in ages.

111
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,040
About a month.
Who is Sherlock Holmes?

112
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,760
See, that does happen.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,280
There's a place they all go to,
him and his friends.

114
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,240
They all do whatever they do.

115
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,560
Shoot up, whatever you call it.

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,280
Where is he? It's a house, it's a
dump. It's practically falling down.

117
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,400
No, the address? Where, exactly?

118
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
Seriously? Why not?

119
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,160
She's not going to the police,
someone's got to get him.

120
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,400
Why you? I'm being neighbourly.
Since when?

121
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,040
Ha, since now.
Since this exact minute.

122
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,560
Why are you being so...? What?

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
I don't know,
what's the matter with you?

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
There is NOTHING the matter with me.

125
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,160
Imagine I said that without
shouting. I'm trying.

126
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
No, you can't come, you're pregnant.

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,760
You can't go, I'm pregnant!

128
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,880
SHE CHUCKLES
What is that?!

129
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a tyre lever. Why? Cos there
were loads of smackheads in there

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and one of them
might need help with a tyre.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,520
If there's any trouble,
just go, I'll be fine.

132
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
John, John, John, John...

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,400
It is a tiny bit sexy.

134
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,880
Yeah, I know.

135
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
JOHN BANGS ON DOOR
Hello?

136
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
What do you want? Excuse me.

137
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,280
DOOR CRASHES OPEN

138
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,960
Oh, no, you can't come in here!

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,480
I'm looking for a friend.
A very specific... friend.

140
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm not just browsing.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
You've got to go.
No-one's allowed here.

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,280
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
Isaac Whitney, you seen him?

143
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm asking you
if you've seen Isaac Whitney

144
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,560
and now you're showing me a knife.

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,960
Is it a clue? Are you doing a mime?

146
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,000
Go. Or I'll cut you.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Oh, not from there. Let me help.

148
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,160
Now, concentrate. Isaac... Whitney?

149
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,640
OK, you asked for it.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,960
MAN GRUNTS IN PAIN

151
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,480
Agh! Ohh!

152
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,360
Right. Are you concentrating yet?

153
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
You broke my arm!

154
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,240
No, I sprained it.

155
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,920
It feels squishy.
Is it supposed to feel squishy?

156
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Feel that! Yeah, it's a sprain.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm a doctor,
I know how to sprain people.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,120
Now where is Isaac Whitney?

159
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
I don't know! Maybe upstairs.

160
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
There you go. Wasn't that easy?

161
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,960
No, it was really sore.

162
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
Mental, you are!

163
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,240
No, just used to a better
class of criminal.

164
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
BIRD CAWING

165
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,920
MAN COUGHING

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Isaac? Isaac Whitney?

167
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,840
OBJECT CLATTERS

168
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,920
Isaac?

169
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,520
MAN RESPONDS WEAKLY

170
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,080
Hello, mate. Sit up for me, sit up.

171
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,760
Dr Watson? Yep.

172
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
Where am I?

173
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,840
Arse-end of the universe with
the scum of the earth. Look at me.

174
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,240
Have you come for me?

175
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,920
Do you think
I know a lot of people here?

176
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,280
Hey, all right?

177
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,680
SHERLOCK: Oh, hello, John.
Didn't expect to see you here.

178
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Come for me too?

179
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,720
Hello, Isaac. Mrs Watson,
can I, can I get in, please?

180
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,760
Yes, of course, get in. Where's
John? They're having a fight.

181
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,160
Who is?!

182
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,680
DOOR CLATTERS
For God sakes, John, I'm on a case!

183
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
A month. That's all it took.

184
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,960
One! I'm working.

185
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,480
"Sherlock Holmes in a drug den."
How's that going to look?!

186
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm undercover. No, you're not!

187
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,640
CAR TYRES SCREECH
Well, I'm not now!

188
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,040
In, both of you, quickly!

189
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,840
Please, can I come?
I think I've got a broken arm.

190
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,360
No, go away. No, let him. Why?
Yeah, just get in. It's a sprain.

191
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,800
Anyone else? I mean, are we taking
everybody home, are we?

192
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
All right, Shezza?

193
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,720
"Shezza"? I WAS undercover!

194
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
Seriously, Shezza, though?

195
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,200
We're not going home, we're going to
Bart's. I'm calling Molly. Why?

196
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,400
Because Sherlock Holmes needs
to pee in a jar.

197
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,840
Well? Is he clean?

198
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,120
Clean?

199
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,320
How dare you throw away the
beautiful gifts you were born with!

200
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,440
And how dare you betray
the love of your friends!

201
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
Say you're sorry.

202
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
Sorry your engagement's over. Though I'm
fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.

203
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,520
Stop it. Just stop it!

204
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,960
If you were anywhere near this
kind of thing again,

205
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,240
you could have called,
you could have talked to me.

206
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,200
Please, do relax.
This is all for a case.

207
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
What kind of case would need
you doing this?

208
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,040
I might as well ask you why you've
started cycling to work?

209
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,000
No, we're not playing this game.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,520
Quite recently, I'd say,
you're very determined about it.

211
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,720
Not interested. I am. Ow!

212
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,360
Oh, sorry, you moved,
but it is just a sprain.

213
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,880
Yeah, somebody hit me. Huh?

214
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,680
Yeah, just some guy.

215
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,760
Yeah, it was probably just
an addict in need of a fix.

216
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
Yes, I think in a way it was.

217
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,720
Is it his shirt? I'm sorry?

218
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,640
Well, it's the creases, isn't it?

219
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,960
The two creases down the front.

220
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,440
It's been recently folded,
but it's not new.

221
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,960
You must have dressed in a hurry
this morning.

222
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,280
So all your shirts must be
kept like that.

223
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
But why?

224
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,320
Maybe cos you cycle to work
every morning, shower

225
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,760
when you get there and then dress
in the clothes you brought with you.

226
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,480
You keep your shirts folded,
ready to pack.

227
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,880
Not bad.

228
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,400
And I further deduce...

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,200
...you've only started recently
because you've got a bit of chafing.

230
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,920
No, he's always walked like that.

231
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,560
Remind me, what's your name again?

232
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,280
They call me the Wig.
No, they don't.

233
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Well, they... they call me Wiggy.

234
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,400
Nope.

235
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,480
Bill. Bill Wiggins.

236
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,760
Nice observational skills, Billy.

237
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,880
TEXT ALERT

238
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,560
Ah, finally!

239
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,760
Finally what? Good news?

240
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
Oh, excellent news, the best.

241
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,280
There's every chance that my drug
habit might hit the newspapers.

242
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,360
The game is on.
Excuse me... for a second.

243
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,240
You've heard of Charles Augustus
Magnussen, of course?

244
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,640
Yeah. Owns some newspapers.
Ones I don't read.

245
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,920
Hang on, weren't there other people?

246
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,160
Mary's taking the boys home,
I'm taking you, we did discuss it.

247
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
People were talking, none of them
were me, I must have filtered.

248
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
I noticed. I have to filter out
a lot of witless babble.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
I've got Mrs Hudson
on semi-permanent mute.

250
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,440
HE SIGHS
What is my brother doing here?

251
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,640
So I'll just pay, then, shall I?

252
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,320
He's straightened the knocker.

253
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760
He always corrects it, it's OCD,
doesn't even know he's doing it.

254
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,160
Why do you do that? Do what?
Nothing.

255
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,880
Well then, Sherlock,
back on the sauce?

256
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,920
What are you doing here?
I phoned him.

257
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,680
The siren call of old habits.
How very like Uncle Rudy.

258
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,720
Though in many ways, cross-dressing would have
been a wiser path for you. You phoned him.

259
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,080
Of course I bloody phoned him.
Of course he bloody did.

260
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,800
Now save me a little time -
where should we be looking?

261
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,640
"We"? ANDERSON: Mr Holmes?

262
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,800
For God's sake!

263
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,200
Anderson?! Sorry, Sherlock,
it's for your own good.

264
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh, that's him, isn't it?
You said he'd be taller.

265
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,560
Some members of your little fan
club. Do be polite.

266
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,200
They're entirely trustworthy
and even willing to search

267
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,360
through the toxic waste dump that
you are pleased to call a flat.

268
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,480
You're a celebrity these days,
Sherlock.

269
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,040
You can't afford a drug habit.

270
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,760
I do not have a drug habit.
JOHN: Hey, what happened to my chair?

271
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,000
It was blocking my view to the
kitchen.

272
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Well, it's good to be missed!

273
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,720
You were gone, I saw an opportunity.
No, you saw the kitchen.

274
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,680
What have you found so far?
Clearly, nothing.

275
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,280
There's nothing to find!

276
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,200
Your bedroom door is shut.
You haven't been home all night.

277
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,440
So, why would a man who has never
knowingly closed a door without

278
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,760
the direct orders of his mother
bother to do so on this occasion?

279
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,920
OK, stop, just stop! Point made.

280
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,400
Jesus, Sherlock!

281
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,040
I shall have to phone our parents,
of course. In Oklahoma.

282
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,760
It won't be the first time that
your substance abuse

283
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,240
has wreaked
havoc with their line dancing.

284
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,520
This is not what you think.
This is for a case.

285
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,640
What case could possibly
justify this?

286
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,560
Magnussen.

287
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,000
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

288
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,120
That name you think you may have
just heard, you were mistaken.

289
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,560
If you ever mention hearing that
name in this room,

290
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,240
in this context,
I guarantee you, on behalf

291
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,160
of the British Security Services,
that materials will be found on

292
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,120
your computer hard-drives, resulting
in your immediate incarceration.

293
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,960
Don't reply, just look frightened
and scuttle.

294
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,160
I hope I won't have to
threaten you as well.

295
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,120
Well, I think we'd both find
that embarrassing.

296
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
Magnussen is not your business.

297
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Oh, you mean he's yours? You may
consider him under my protection.

298
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,480
I consider you under his thumb.

299
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,400
If you go against Magnussen,

300
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,640
then you will find yourself
going against me.

301
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,960
OK. I'll let you know if I notice.

302
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,840
Um, what was I going to say?
Oh, yeah.

303
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,440
Bye-bye.

304
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,680
Unwise, brother mine.

305
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,880
Ohh! Ugh!

306
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
Brother mine...

307
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,840
...don't appal me when I'm high.

308
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,680
Mycroft, don't say another word,
just go.

309
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,040
He could snap you in two
and right now,

310
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm slightly worried that he might.

311
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Don't speak, just leave.

312
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,160
Oh.

313
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

314
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,280
Er, Magnussen?

315
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,200
What time is it? About eight.

316
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
I'll be meeting him in three hours.
I need a bath.

317
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
It's for a case, you say? Yep.
What sort of case?

318
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,640
Too big and dangerous for any sane
individual to get involved in.

319
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,400
You trying to put me off? God, no.

320
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,720
Trying to recruit you.

321
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,040
And stay out of my bedroom.

322
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,560
Oh, John, hi. How are you?

323
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,680
Janine?

324
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Sorry, not dressed.
Has everybody gone?

325
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,240
I heard shouting.
Yes, they're gone.

326
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,400
God, look at the time. I'll be late.

327
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,520
It sounded like an argument.
Was it Mike? Mike?

328
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,640
Mike, yeah. His brother, Mike.
They're always fighting.

329
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,880
Mycroft.

330
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,440
Do people actually call him that?

331
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,640
Yeah. Huh!

332
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,760
Oh, could you be a love
and put some coffee on?

333
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
Sure, right, yeah.

334
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,840
Thanks. Oh, how is Mary?
How's married life?

335
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,360
She's fine. We're both fine. Yeah.

336
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,320
Oh, it's over there now.
Where's Sherl?

337
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
(Sherl!)

338
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
Er, he's just having a bath.
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.

339
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,240
Oh, like he ever is! Yeah.

340
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,120
SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR
Morning. Room for a little one?

341
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,240
SHERLOCK AND JANINE GIGGLE

342
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Morning.

343
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
SHERLOCK LAUGHS

344
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,560
Ooh!

345
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,520
So, it's just a guess, but you've
probably got some questions?

346
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,880
Yeah, one or two. Pretty much.

347
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,280
Naturally.

348
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,560
You have a girlfriend? Yes, I have.

349
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.

350
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
It's the only way
I can describe him.

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,920
Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London
Aquarium, John? Stood up close to the glass?

352
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,360
Those floating, flat faces,
those dead eyes. That's what he is.

353
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,880
I've dealt with murderers,
psychopaths,

354
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,160
terrorists, serial killers.

355
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,000
None of them can turn my stomach
like Charles Augustus Magnussen.

356
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,120
Yes, you have?

357
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
Sorry, what?

358
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,600
You have a girlfriend? What? Yes,
yes, I'm going out with Janine.

359
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
I thought that was fairly obvious.
Yes. Well, yes.

360
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,440
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

361
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,280
You... You... You are
in a relationship?

362
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Yes, I am.

363
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,920
You and Janine? Hmm.
Yes, me and Janine.

364
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
Care to elaborate?

365
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
Well, we're in a good place.
It's, um...

366
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,120
very affirming.
You got that from a book.

367
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,520
Everyone got that from a book.

368
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,280
OK, you two bad boys.
Behave yourselves.

369
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,480
You, Sherl, you're going to have to
tell me where you were last night.

370
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,400
Working. Working? Of course.

371
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,560
I'm the only one who really knows
what you're like, remember?

372
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Well, don't you go letting on.

373
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,920
I might just, actually.

374
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I haven't told Mary about this.

375
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,240
I kind of wanted to surprise her.
Yeah, I think you probably will.

376
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,760
But we should have you two
over for dinner, really soon.

377
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah. My place though,
not the scuzz-dump.

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,920
Great, yeah.

379
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,600
Dinner, yeah.

380
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,040
I'd better dash. It was
brilliant to see you. You too.

381
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Have a lovely day. Call me later.

382
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,920
I might do. I might call you.

383
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,960
Unless I meet someone prettier.

384
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.

385
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,560
You know Magnussen
as a newspaper owner,

386
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,280
but he is so much more than that.

387
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,840
He uses his power and wealth
to gain information.

388
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,880
The more he acquires,
the greater his wealth and power.

389
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,440
And I'm not exaggerating when I say that he knows
the critical pressure point on every person of note

390
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,920
or influence in the whole of the
Western World and probably beyond.

391
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,560
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

392
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,520
And he has created an unassailable
architecture of forbidden knowledge.

393
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,480
Its name...

394
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,280
is Appledore.

395
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,600
Dinner? Sorry, what dinner?

396
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,720
Me and Mary coming for dinner with...

397
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,360
wine and...

398
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,560
sitting.

399
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,480
Seriously? I have just told you that
the Western World is run

400
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,840
from this house and you want to talk about
dinner? Fine. Talk about the house.

401
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,160
It is the greatest repository
of sensitive and dangerous

402
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,880
information anywhere in the world,

403
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,640
the Alexandrian Library
of secrets and scandals

404
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,760
and none of it is on a computer.

405
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,680
He's smart. Computers can be hacked.

406
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,480
It's all on hard copy, in vaults,
underneath that house.

407
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,160
And as long as it is,
the personal freedom of anyone

408
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,040
you've ever met is a fantasy.

409
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,960
KNOCKING ON DOOR

410
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
That was the doorbell.
Couldn't you hear it?

411
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,920
It's in the fridge. It kept ringing.
Oh, that's not a fault, Sherlock!

412
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,640
Who is it?

413
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,080
Mr Holmes said you can go right up.

414
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,760
Oh. Go ahead.

415
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
Sir?

416
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,800
Can I have a moment?

417
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,120
He's fine.

418
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,120
Look, I... Right.
I should probably tell you...

419
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
OK, I...

420
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,800
There.

421
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,400
Doesn't mean I'm not
pleased to see you.

422
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,440
I can vouch for this man.
He is a doctor.

423
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,280
If you know who I am,
then you know who he is.

424
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,960
Don't you, Mr Magnussen?

425
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,200
I understood we were meeting
at YOUR office.

426
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,600
This is my office.

427
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,080
Well, it is now.

428
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,520
Mr Magnussen, I have been
asked to intercede with you

429
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,600
by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood

430
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,400
on the matter
of her husband's letters.

431
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,760
Some time ago you put pressure
on her concerning those letters.

432
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
She would like those letters back.

433
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,880
Obviously, the letters no longer
have any practical use to you,

434
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,520
so with that in mind...

435
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
Something I said?

436
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,960
No, no. I was reading.

437
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
There's rather a lot.

438
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,200
Redbeard?

439
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,480
Sorry. Sorry, you were
probably talking.

440
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,160
I...

441
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,040
I was trying to explain that I have
been asked to act on behalf of...

442
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,080
Bathroom?
Along from the kitchen, sir.

443
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,120
OK. I've been asked to negotiate
the return of those letters.

444
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,160
I am aware you do not make copies
of sensitive documents.

445
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,560
Is it like the rest of the flat?
Sir? The bathroom?

446
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,440
Yes, sir. Maybe not then.

447
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Am I acceptable to you
as an intermediary?

448
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,160
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood...

449
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,560
I like her.

450
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,640
Mr Magnussen,
am I acceptable to you

451
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,480
as an intermediary?

452
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,080
She's English with a spine.

453
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,120
Best thing about the English...

454
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,400
...you're so domesticated.

455
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,560
All standing around, apologising...

456
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
...keeping your little heads down.

457
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,440
You can do what you like here.
No-one's ever going to stop you.

458
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,960
A nation of herbivores.

459
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,280
URINE TRICKLES

460
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,520
I have interests
all over the world but...

461
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,320
everything starts in England.

462
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,720
If it works here...

463
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,240
ZIPS UP TROUSERS

464
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
...I try it in a real country.

465
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,880
The United Kingdom,

466
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
Petri dish to the Western World.

467
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,320
Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need
those letters so...

468
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,600
I'm keeping them.

469
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Goodbye.

470
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,840
Anyway...

471
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,040
...they're funny.

472
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,360
Jesus!

473
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,320
Did you notice the one
extraordinary thing he did?

474
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,360
There was a moment that
kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.

475
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,760
Exactly. When he showed us
the letters.

476
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,400
OK. So, he's brought
the letters to London,

477
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,560
so no matter what he says,
he's ready to make a deal.

478
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,120
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once
he's established a person's weaknesses,

479
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,800
the pressure point, he calls it.
So, clearly he believes

480
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,720
I'm a drug addict
and no serious threat.

481
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,920
And of course, because he's in town tonight, the
letters will be in his safe in his London office

482
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,120
while he's out to dinner with the Marketing
Group of GB from seven till ten.

483
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
How do you know his schedule? Because
I do. I'll see you tonight.

484
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,240
I've got some shopping to do.
What's tonight?

485
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,480
I'll text instructions.

486
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,080
Yeah, I'll text YOU if I'm available.
You are, I checked.

487
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,840
Don't bring a gun.
Why would I bring a gun?

488
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,000
Or a knife or a tyre lever. Probably
best not to do any arm-spraining,

489
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,080
but we'll see how the night goes. Are
you just assuming I'm coming along?

490
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,040
Time you got out of the house, John. You've put on
7lbs since you married and the cycling isn't doing it.

491
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,200
It's actually 4lbs. Mary and I
think seven. See you later.

492
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,880
TV REPORTER: And breaking news now.

493
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,520
John Garvie MP has been arrested
today on charges of corruption.

494
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
This follows an investigation...

495
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,960
Magnussen's office is on the top
floor, just below his private flat.

496
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,560
There are 14 layers of security
between us and him,

497
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,200
two of which aren't even
legal in this country.

498
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,480
Want to know how we're going to break in? Is that
what we're doing? Of course it's what we're doing.

499
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,560
Magnussen's private lift.

500
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,120
Goes straight to his penthouse
and office. Only he uses it

501
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,320
and only his keycard calls the lift.

502
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,000
If anyone else even tries,
security is automatically informed.

503
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
Standard keycard for the building.

504
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,960
Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us
as far as the canteen.

505
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,800
Here we go then. If I was to use
this card on that lift now,

506
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,400
what happens?
Well, the alarms would go off

507
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,480
and you'd be dragged away
by security. Exactly.

508
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,120
Get taken to a small room somewhere
and your head kicked in.

509
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Do we really need so much colour?
It passes the time.

510
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,760
But if I do this...

511
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,600
If you press a keycard against
your mobile phone for long enough,

512
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
it corrupts the magnetic strip.
The card stops working.

513
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,880
It's a common problem. Never put
your keycard with your phone.

514
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,680
What happens if I use the card now?

515
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,440
It still doesn't work.

516
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,920
But it doesn't read
as the wrong card now.

517
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,880
It registers as corrupted.

518
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,000
But if it's corrupted, how
do they know it's not Magnussen?

519
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,120
Would they risk dragging him off?
Probably not.

520
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,440
So, what do they do?
What do they have to do?

521
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,640
Check if it's him or not.

522
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,720
There's a camera at eye height
to the right of the door.

523
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,120
A live picture of the card user
is relayed directly

524
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,320
to Magnussen's personal staff
in his office,

525
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,080
the only people trusted
to make a positive ID.

526
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,040
At this hour,
almost certainly his PA.

527
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
So, how does that help us?

528
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,680
Human error.

529
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,800
I've been shopping.

530
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,280
Here we go then.

531
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,200
You realise you don't exactly
look like Magnussen?

532
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,960
Which in this case is
a considerable advantage.

533
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,320
BEEPING

534
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,920
Sherlock, you complete loon. What are
you doing?! Hang on, was that...?

535
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,480
Hi, Janine.

536
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,600
Go on, let me in.

537
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,880
I can't. You know I can't.
Don't be silly.

538
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Don't make me do it out here.

539
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Not in front of everyone.

540
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,000
Do what in front of everyone?

541
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,040
You see, as long as there's people, there's
always a weak spot. That was Janine.

542
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Yes, of course it was.
She's Magnussen's PA.

543
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,520
That's the whole point. Did you just get engaged to
break into an office? Yeah. Stroke of luck meeting her

544
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,040
at your wedding. You can take
some of the credit. Jesus!

545
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,600
Sherlock, she loves you.
Yes. Like I said, human error.

546
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,320
What are you going to do? Well, not
actually marry her, obviously.

547
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,480
There's only so far you can go.
So, what will you tell her?

548
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,640
Well, I'll tell her that our entire
relationship was a ruse

549
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,440
to break into her boss's office.
I imagine she'll want to stop

550
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,160
seeing me at that point,
but you're the expert on women.

551
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,160
So, where did she go?

552
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,840
That's a bit rude.
I just proposed to her.

553
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,160
Sherlock.

554
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,240
Did she faint?

555
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
Do they really do that?!

556
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,120
It's a blow to the head.

557
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,760
She's breathing.

558
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,800
Janine?

559
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,040
SHE MURMURS
Another in here.

560
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,280
Security.

561
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
Does he need help?

562
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,120
Ex-con. White supremacist
by the tattoos, so who cares?

563
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,240
Stick with Janine.

564
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,520
Janine, focus on my voice.
Can you hear me?

565
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,160
Hey, they must still be here.

566
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,040
So is Magnussen.
His seat's still warm.

567
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,000
He should be at dinner,
but he's still in the building.

568
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,920
Upstairs. We should call the police.
During our own burglary?

569
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,880
You're really not a natural
at this, are you?

570
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,520
No, wait. Sssh.

571
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,000
Perfume and not Janine's.

572
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,720
Claire de la Lune.
Why do I know it?

573
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,960
Mary wears it. No, not Mary.
Somebody else.

574
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,480
CLANGING

575
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,000
Sherlock!

576
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,200
What would your husband think?

577
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,440
Your lovely husband,
upright and honourable,

578
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,720
so English. What would
he say to you now?

579
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,480
No, no!

580
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,640
You're doing this to protect
him from the truth?

581
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
Well, is this the protection
he would want?

582
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,320
Additionally, if you're
going to commit murder,

583
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,120
you might consider changing
your perfume, Lady Smallwood.

584
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,040
Sorry. Who?

585
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,280
That's... not Lady Smallwood,
Mr Holmes.

586
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,320
Is John with you? He's, um...

587
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,360
Is John here?

588
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,960
He's downstairs.

589
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,240
So, what do you do now?

590
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,960
Kill us both?

591
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,520
Mary, whatever he's got on you,
let me help.

592
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,880
Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more
step, I swear I will kill you.

593
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,360
No, Mrs Watson...

594
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,960
you won't.

595
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

596
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,160
I truly am.

597
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,960
Mary?

598
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,800
ALARM RINGS

599
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,960
It's not like it is in the movies.

600
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,200
There's not a great big spurt of
blood and you go flying backwards.

601
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,920
The impact isn't spread
over a wide area.

602
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,760
It's tightly focused so there's
little or no energy transfer.

603
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,680
You stay still
and the bullet pushes through.

604
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,320
You're almost certainly going
to die, so we need to focus.

605
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,920
I said, "Focus!"

606
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
It's all well and clever
having a mind palace,

607
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,840
but you've only three seconds
of consciousness left to use it.

608
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,480
So, come on.
What's going to kill you?

609
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
Blood loss. Exactly.
So, it's all about one thing now -

610
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,600
forwards or backwards?

611
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,960
We need to decide which way
you're going to fall.

612
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,920
One hole or two? Sorry?
Is the bullet still inside you?

613
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,600
Or is there an exit wound?
It'll depend on the gun.

614
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,800
That one, I think.

615
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,360
Or that one.

616
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,280
Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock.
It doesn't matter about the gun.

617
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,040
Don't be stupid.

618
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,400
You always were so stupid.

619
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
Such a disappointment.

620
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm not stupid.

621
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,640
You're a very stupid little boy.

622
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,840
Mummy and Daddy are very cross

623
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,280
because it doesn't matter
about the gun.

624
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,560
Why not?

625
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,760
You saw the whole room
when you entered it.

626
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,360
What was directly behind you
when you were murdered?

627
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,600
I've not been murdered YET.

628
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,800
Balance of probability,
little brother.

629
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,360
If the bullet had passed through
you, what would you have heard?

630
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,800
The mirror shattering.

631
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
You didn't. Therefore...?

632
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,960
The bullet's still inside me.

633
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,000
So we need to take him
down backwards.

634
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,960
I agree. Sherlock,
you need to fall on your back.

635
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,200
Right now the bullet is
the cork in a bottle.

636
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,760
The bullet itself is blocking
most of the blood flow.

637
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,120
But any pressure or impact on the
entrance wound could dislodge it.

638
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,640
Plus, on your back, gravity's
working for us.

639
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,960
Fall...

640
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,200
now.

641
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,200
ALARM RINGS

642
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,960
What the hell is that?!
What's happening?!

643
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,200
You're going into shock. It's the
next thing that's going to kill you.

644
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,160
What do I do? Don't go
into shock, obviously.

645
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,320
Must be something in this ridiculous
memory palace of yours

646
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,760
that can calm you down.

647
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
Find it.

648
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,920
The East Wind is coming, Sherlock.

649
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,600
It's coming to get you.

650
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,800
SCREAMS ECHO

651
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,240
Find it.

652
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,160
Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy.

653
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,760
Come on. Come to me.

654
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,560
It's OK. It's all right.

655
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,600
YOUNG SHERLOCK: Come on.
It's me. It's me.

656
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Come on.

657
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
Good boy. Clever boy.

658
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,200
Good boy.

659
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,080
Hello, Redbeard. They're putting
me down too now.

660
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,680
It's no fun, is it?

661
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,360
Redbeard.

662
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,400
That was shock. You're going
to feel the pain.

663
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,640
There's a hole ripped through you.

664
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,840
Massive internal bleeding.

665
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,120
You have to control the pain.

666
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Control. Control. Control.

667
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,520
You...

668
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,480
You never felt pain, did you?

669
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,280
Why did you never feel pain?

670
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,000
You always feel it, Sherlock.

671
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,920
But you don't have to fear it!

672
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,960
SHERLOCK GROANS

673
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,560
Pain...

674
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,720
...heartbreak...

675
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,480
...loss...

676
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,960
...death...

677
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,520
...it's all good.

678
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,080
It's all good.

679
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,040
Sherlock! Sherlock. Can you hear me?

680
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,520
What happened?

681
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,760
He got shot.

682
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,880
Jesus!

683
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,200
Sherlock.

684
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh, my!

685
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
Who shot him?!

686
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,240
'Emergency. Which service
do you require?'

687
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,440
♪ It's raining

688
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,440
♪ It's pouring

689
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,200
♪ Sherlock is boring

690
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,720
♪ I'm laughing

691
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,320
♪ I'm crying

692
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,120
♪ Sherlock is dying. ♪

693
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,840
Sherlock!

694
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,080
We're losing you. Sherlock!

695
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,080
Come on, Sherlock.
Just die, why can't you?

696
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,480
One little push

697
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,000
and off you pop.

698
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,720
You're going to love being dead,
Sherlock. No-one ever bothers you.

699
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,640
Mrs Hudson will cry...

700
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,960
and Mummy and Daddy will cry...

701
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,200
and the woman will cry and John
will cry buckets and buckets.

702
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,280
It's him that I worry about
the most. That wife!

703
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,520
You're letting him down, Sherlock.

704
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,480
John Watson is definitely in danger.

705
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,360
Oh, you're not getting
better, are you?

706
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,000
Was it something I said, huh?

707
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,200
Sherlock!

708
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,880
SHERLOCK GROANS

709
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,520
Mary. Hey.

710
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,240
He's only bloody woken up.

711
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,600
He's pulled through. Really?
Yeah. Seriously? You...

712
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,360
Mrs Watson, you're in big trouble.

713
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,760
Really? Why?

714
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,720
His first word when he woke up...

715
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,960
"Mary."

716
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,000
HE CHUCKLES

717
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,680
You don't tell him.

718
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,200
Sherlock?

719
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,760
You don't tell John.

720
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,000
Bad girl.

721
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,760
Bad, bad girl.

722
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,200
Look at me...

723
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,720
...and tell me you're not
going to tell him.

724
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,040
I'm buying a cottage.

725
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,520
I've made a lot of money
out of you, mister.

726
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,880
Nothing hits the spot
like revenge with profits.

727
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,360
You didn't give those stories
to Magnussen, did you?

728
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,560
God, no. One of his rivals.
He was spitting.

729
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,160
Hmm.

730
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,640
Sherlock Holmes, you are
a back-stabbing, heartless,

731
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,400
manipulative bastard.

732
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,560
And you, as it turns out,
are a grasping, opportunistic,

733
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,040
publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.

734
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,520
So, we're good then?

735
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,560
Yeah, of course.

736
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,320
Where's the cottage? Sussex Downs.

737
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,240
Nice. It's gorgeous.

738
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,640
There's beehives,
but I'm getting rid of those.

739
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,960
HE GASPS
Oh, it hurts, does it?

740
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
Probably want to restart
your morphine.

741
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,680
I might have fiddled with the taps.

742
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,200
How much more revenge are you going
to need? Just the occasional top-up.

743
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,360
Dream come true for you, this place.

744
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,560
They actually attach
the drugs to you.

745
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,200
Not good for working.

746
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,760
You won't be working
for a while, Sherl.

747
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,680
You lied to me.

748
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,000
You lied and lied.

749
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,800
I exploited the fact
of our connection.

750
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,080
When?

751
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Just once would have been nice.

752
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,160
Oh.

753
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,520
I was waiting till we got married.

754
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,640
That was never going to happen.

755
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
Got to go.

756
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,560
I'm not supposed
to keep you talking.

757
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,200
And also, I have an interview
with The One Show

758
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,600
and I haven't made it up yet.

759
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,320
Just one thing...

760
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,840
you shouldn't have lied to me.

761
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,320
I know what kind of man you are,

762
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,040
but we could have been friends.

763
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,160
I'll give your love
to John and Mary.

764
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,520
You don't tell him.

765
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,880
You don't tell John.

766
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,240
So...

767
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,240
...Mary Watson...

768
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,720
...who are you?

769
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,840
Mary Watson.

770
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,640
I don't know how much sense
you'll get out of him.

771
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,840
He's drugged up,
so he's pretty much babbling.

772
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,040
Oh, they won't let you use
that in here, you know?

773
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,480
No, I'm not going to use the phone.
I just want to take a video.

774
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,800
Oh, Jesus!

775
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,880
So, where would he go?

776
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,560
Oh, Christ knows!

777
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,040
Try finding Sherlock in London.

778
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,360
He's got three known bolt-holes.

779
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,360
Parliament Hill, Camden Lock
and Dagmar Court.

780
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,000
Five known bolt holes.

781
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,280
There's the blind greenhouse
in Kew Gardens

782
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,360
and the leaning tomb
in Hampstead Cemetery.

783
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,840
Just the spare bedroom.

784
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,120
Well, my bedroom.

785
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,760
We agreed he needs the space.

786
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,520
Behind the clock face of Big Ben.

787
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,160
I think he was probably joking.

788
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,440
No, I don't think so.

789
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,640
Leinster Gardens. It's his number
one bolt hole. Top, top secret.

790
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,880
He only knows about it
cos he stalked him one night.

791
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,760
Followed! Followed, yeah.

792
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,720
He knew who shot him.

793
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,600
The bullet wound was here,
so he was facing whoever it was.

So, why not tell us? Because he's
tracking them down himself.

795
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,680
Or protecting them.
Protecting the shooter, why?

796
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,160
Well, protecting someone then.
But why would he care?

797
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,920
He's Sherlock. Who would he
bother protecting?

798
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,200
Call me if you hear anything.
Don't hold out on me, John.

799
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,520
Call me, OK? Yeah. Yeah, right.

800
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,520
Good night then. Bye then.

801
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
John, need a cuppa?

802
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,680
Mrs Hudson, why does Sherlock think
that I'll be moving back in here?

803
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,520
Oh, yes, he's put your chair
back again, hasn't he?

804
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,080
That's nice. It looks much better.

805
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,800

808
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,880
John, you have to answer it!

Oh, come on, love.

for Sherlock Holmes, he finds you.

Well, I suppose that was a fairly
obvious trick.

And yet,
over a distance of six feet,

872

you failed to make a kill shot.

not enough to kill me.

that was surgery.

I'll take the case. What case?

Yours. Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

877
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,600
Because John can't ever know that
I lied to him.

878
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,240
It would break him
and I would lose him forever.

let that happen.

Please, understand,

881

would not do to stop that happening.

Why are we doing this?
We never do this.

We are here because Sherlock
is home from hospital

absolutely sure why you're here.

I invited him.

902
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,080
I'm his protege, Mrs Holmes.

903
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,160
When he dies,
I get all his stuff and his job.

904
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,680
No. Oh, well, I help out a bit.

905
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,760
Closer.

906
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,600
If he does get murdered or
something...

907
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,680
Probably stop talking now. OK.

908
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,800

bring your friends round(!)

909

If I ever find out who,
I shall turn absolutely monstrous.

911

This was for Mary.
I'll be back in a minute.

making little humming noises,

914
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,360
just give him a little poke.
That usually does it.

915
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,440
Did you write this?

916
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,560
Oh, that silly old thing,
you mustn't read that.

917
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,720
Mathematics must seem terribly
fatuous now.

918
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,800
No humming, you.

919
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,440
Complete flake, my wife, but happens
to be a genius.

920
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,000
She was a mathematician?

921
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,640
Gave it all up for children. I could
never bear to argue with her.

922
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,360
I'm something of a moron myself.

923
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,120
But she's... unbelievably hot.

924
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,120
Oh my God, you're the sane one,
aren't you?

925
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,400
Aren't you?

926
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,040
Oh. Sorry, I just, er...

927
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,400
Oh, you two need a moment?

928
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,280
If you don't mind?

929
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,240
No, course not. I'll go and see if
I can help with...

930
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,720
something or another.

931
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,160
Those two. They all right?

932
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,520
Well, you know,
they've had their ups and downs.

933
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,480
Baker Street, now.

934
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,200
John, Mary...

935
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,120
Oh, Sherlock, oh, good gracious,
you look terrible!

936
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,520
Get me some morphine
from your kitchen, I've run out.

937
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,160
I don't have any morphine. Then what
exactly is the point of you?!

938
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,680
What is going on?

939
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,000
Bloody good question.

940
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The Watsons are about to have a domestic and fairly
quickly I hope, because we've got work to do.

941
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,360
No, I have a better question -

942
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,440
is everyone I have ever met
a psychopath?

943
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,960
Yes.

944
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,720
Good that we've settled that.
Now we... SHUT UP!

945
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,680
And stay shut up,
because this is not funny.

946
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,720
Not this time.

947
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,560
I didn't say it was funny. You.

948
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,280
What have I ever done? Hmm?

949
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,080
My whole life, to deserve you?

950
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,640
Everything.

951
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,320
Sherlock, I've told you, shut up.

952
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,360
No, I mean it -
seriously, everything.

953
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,680
Everything you've ever done,
is what you did.

954
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,080
Sherlock, one more word
and you will not need morphine.

955
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,080
You were a doctor who went to war.

956
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,960
You're a man who couldn't stay in
the suburbs for more than a month

957
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,360
without storming a crack den,
beating up a junkie.

958
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,880
Your best friend is a
sociopath, who solves crimes

959
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,520
as an alternative to getting high.
That's me, by the way, hello.

960
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,440
Even the landlady used to
run a drug cartel.

961
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,440
It was my husband's cartel.
I was just typing.

962
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,080
And exotic dancing.

963
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,480
Sherlock Holmes,
if you've been YouTubing...

964
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,240
John, you are addicted to
a certain lifestyle.

965
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,560
You are abnormally attracted to
dangerous situations and people,

966
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,440
so is it truly such a surprise
that the woman you fall in love with

967
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,080
conforms to that pattern?

968
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,480
But she wasn't supposed to
be like that!

969
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,080
Why is SHE like that?

970
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,600
Because you chose her.

971
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,880
Why is everything always

972
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,040
MY FAULT?!

973
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,960
Oh, neighbours!

974
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,560
John, listen. Be calm and answer me.

975
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,520
What is she?

976
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,760
My lying wife? No, what is she?

977
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,280
And the woman who is carrying my child, who
has lied to me since the day I met her.

978
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,640
No. Not in this flat,
not in this room.

979
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,360
Right here, right now, what is she?

980
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,400
OK.

981
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,720
Your way.

982
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,920
Always your way.

983
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,840
HE CLEARS THROAT

984
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,120
Sit.

985
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,480
Why?

986
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,560
Because that's where they sit.

987
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,640
The people who come in here
with their stories.

988
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,000
They're the clients,
that's all you are now, Mary.

989
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,040
You're a client.

990
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,640
This is where you sit and talk
and this is where we sit and listen.

991
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,600
Then we decide
if we want you or not.

992
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,440
So, are you OK?

993
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Oh, are we doing conversation today?
It really is Christmas(!)

994
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,600
Now?

995
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,000
Seriously, months of silence
and we're going to do this now?

996
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,280
A.G.R.A., what's that?

997
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,440
Er... my initials.

998
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,560
Everything about who
I was is on there.

999
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,920
If you love me,
don't read it in front of me.

1000
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,840
Why?

1001
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,040
Because you won't love me
when you've finished

1002
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,840
and I don't want to see that happen.

1003
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,000
WATSON SIGHS

1004
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,920
How much do you know already?

1005
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,240
By your skill set, you are, or were,
an intelligence agent.

1006
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,280
Your accent is currently English,
but I suspect you are not.

1007
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,840
You're on the run from something.

1008
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,080
You've used your skills
to disappear.

1009
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,000
Magnussen knows your secret, which
is why you were going to kill him.

1010
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,880
And I assume you befriended
Janine in order to get close to him.

1011
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,160
Oh, you can talk!

1012
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,480
Oh, look at you two,
you should have got married.

1013
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,840
The stuff Magnussen has on me,

1014
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,640
I would go to prison for the rest of
my life.

1015
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,720
So you were going to kill him? People
like Magnussen should be killed,

1016
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,160
that's why there are people like me.
Perfect!

1017
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,240
So that's what you were, an assassin?
How could I not see that?

1018
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,480
You did see that.

1019
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,680
And you married me.

1020
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,160
Because he's right.

1021
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,840
It's what you like.

1022
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,080
So, Mary, any documents that
Magnussen has

1023
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,360
concerning yourself,
you want extracted and returned.

1024
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,400
Why would you help me?

1025
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,680
Because you saved my life.

1026
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,000
Sorry-sorry, what?

1027
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,280
When I happened on you
and Magnussen...

1028
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,520
...you had a problem.

1029
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,000
More specifically,
you had a witness.

1030
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,720
What do you do now?

1031
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,840
Kill both of us?

1032
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,880
GUNSHOT

1033
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,600
'The solution, of course, was
simple. Kill us both and leave.'

1034
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,800
However,
sentiment got the better of you.

1035
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,720
'One precisely calculated shot
to incapacitate me,

1036
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,840
'in the hope that it would buy you
more time to negotiate my silence.'

1037
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,520
Of course,
you couldn't shoot Magnussen.

1038
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,640
On the night both of us
broke into the building,

1039
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,320
your own husband would
become a suspect. So...

1040
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,040
'You calculated that Magnussen would
use the fact of your involvement...'

1041
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,560
rather than sharing the information
with the police, as is his MO.

1042
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,680
And then you left the way you came.

1043
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,160
Have I missed anything?

1044
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,760
How did she save your life?

1045
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,040
She phoned the ambulance.
I phoned the ambulance.

1046
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,560
She phoned first.

1047
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,920
'Emergency,
which service do you require?'

1048
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,000
You didn't find me
for another five minutes.

1049
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,440
Left to you, I would have died.

1050
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,600
The average arrival
time for a London ambulance is...

1051
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,720
Did somebody call an ambulance?

1052
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,720
Eight minutes. Did you bring any
morphine? I asked on the phone.

1053
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,360
We were told there was a shooting.

1054
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,080
There was, last week.

1055
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,800
But I believe I'm bleeding
internally,

1056
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,960
my pulse is very erratic, you may need
to restart my heart on the way...

1057
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,600
Jesus, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.
Argh!

1058
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,200
John, John,
Magnussen is all that matters now.

1059
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,680
You can trust Mary -
she saved my life.

1060
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,280
She shot you.

1061
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,840
Mixed messages, I grant you that...
Argh!

1062
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,000
Sherlock! Sherlock! Take him.

1063
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,240
Got him? Yeah.

1064
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,440
SHERLOCK GRUNTS IN PAIN

1065
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,400
So, have you read it?

1066
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,280
Would you come here a moment?
No, tell me, have you?

1067
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,360
Just... Come here.

1068
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,360
No, I'm fine.

1069
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,840
I've thought long and hard
about what I want to say to you.

1070
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,280
These are prepared words, Mary.

1071
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,920
I've chosen these words with care.
OK.

1072
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,320
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

1073
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,440
The problems of your past
are your business.

1074
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,840
The problems of your future...

1075
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,960
are my privilege.

1076
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,480
It's all I have to say,
it's all I need to know.

1077
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,960
No, I didn't read it.

1078
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,240
You don't even know my name.

1079
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,720
Is "Mary Watson" good enough for you?

1080
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,520
Yes. Oh my God, yes.

1081
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,360
Then it's good enough for me, too.

1082
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,320
SHE SOBS

1083
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,600
All this does not mean that I'm not
still basically pissed off with you.

1084
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,000
Hmm, I know, I know.

1085
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I am very pissed off,
and it will come out now and then.

1086
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,240
I know, I know, I know.

1087
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,640
You can mow the sodding
lawn from now on.

1088
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,440
I do mow the lawn. I do it loads.

1089
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,680
You really don't.

1090
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,080
I choose the baby's name.
Not a chance. OK.

1091
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,120
I'm glad you've given up on the
Magnussen business. Are you?

1092
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,720
I'm still curious, though. He's
hardly your usual kind of puzzle.

1093
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,200
Why do you hate him?

1094
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,240
Because he attacks people
who are different

1095
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,840
and preys on their secrets.
Why don't you?

1096
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,520
He never causes too much damage
to anyone important.

1097
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,440
He's far too intelligent for that.

1098
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,840
He's a businessman, that's all.
And occasionally useful to us.

1099
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,920
A necessary evil,
not a dragon for you to slay.

1100
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,480
A dragon-slayer.
Is that what you think of me?

1101
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,680
No. It's what you think of yourself.

1102
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,080
Are you two smoking?!

1103
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,440
No. It was Mycroft.

1104
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,200
I have, by the way, a job offer
I should like you to decline.

1105
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,240
I decline your kind offer.

1106
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,640
I shall pass on your regrets.

1107
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:30,320
What was it? MI6. They want to
place you back into Eastern Europe.

1108
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,720
An undercover assignment
that would prove fatal to you in,

1109
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,520
I think, about six months.

1110
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,040
Then why don't you want me
to take it?

1111
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,200
It's tempting, but on balance, you
have more utility closer to home.

1112
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,480
Utility! How do I have utility?

1113
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,720
Here be dragons.

1114
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,600
HE COUGHS
This isn't agreeing with me.

1115
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,920
I'm going in.

1116
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,480
You need low tar.
You still smoke like a beginner.

1117
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,720
Also...

1118
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,280
...your loss would break my heart.

1119
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,920
HE COUGHS

1120
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,320
What the hell am
I supposed to say to that?!

1121
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,360
Merry Christmas? You hate Christmas.

1122
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,120
Yes. Perhaps there was
something in the punch.

1123
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,120
Clearly. Go and have some more.

1124
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,320
So you realise that Sherlock got us out
here to see his mum and dad for a reason?

1125
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,640
His lovely mum and dad, a fine
example of married life, I get that.

1126
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,200
That is the thing with Sherlock,
it's always the unexpected.

1127
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,520
Oi. Oi? Mary?

1128
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,600
Jesus Christ! Mary? Sit down.

1129
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,840
Mary, can you hear me?

1130
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,360
Don't drink Mary's tea.

1131
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,120
Or the punch.

1132
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,720
Sherlock...

1133
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,840
Did you just drug my pregnant wife?!

1134
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,200
Don't worry,
Wiggins is an excellent chemist.

1135
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,560
I calculated your wife's dose
myself. Won't affect the little one.

1136
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,680
I'll keep an eye on her.

1137
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,720
He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his day job.

1138
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,000
What the hell have you done?!

1139
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,040
A deal with the devil.

1140
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,200
Shouldn't you be in hospital?

1141
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,800
I am in hospital.
This is the canteen.

1142
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,120
Is it? In my opinion, yes.
Have a seat.

1143
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,160
Thank you.

1144
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,360
I've been thinking about you.

1145
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,520
I've been thinking about you.

1146
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,960
Really?

1147
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,760
I want to see Appledore.

1148
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,160
Where you keep all the secrets,
all the files,

1149
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,440
everything you've got on everyone.

1150
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,160
I want you to invite me.

1151
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,800
What makes you think
I'd be so careless?

1152
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,800
Oh, I think you're a lot more
careless than you let on.

1153
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,520
Am I?

1154
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,880
It's the dead-eyed stare
that gives it away.

1155
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,720
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?

1156
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,360
You're reading.

1157
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,960
Portable Appledore.
How does it work?

1158
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,920
Built-in flash drive? 4G wireless?

1159
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,160
They're just ordinary spectacles.

1160
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,920
Yes, they are.

1161
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,040
You underestimate me, Mr Holmes.

1162
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,920
Impress me, then. Show me Appledore.

1163
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,520
Everything is available for a price.

1164
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,280
Are you making me an offer?

1165
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,520
A Christmas present.

1166
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,520
And what are you giving me
for Christmas, Mr Holmes?

1167
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,880
My brother.

1168
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,440
Oh, Jesus!

1169
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,000
Sherlock, please tell me you haven't
just gone out of your mind.

1170
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,440
I'd rather keep you guessing.

1171
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,280
HELICOPTER WHIRS

1172
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,720
Ah, there's our lift.

1173
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,840
Coming?

1174
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,320
Where?

1175
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,240
You want your wife to be safe?
Of course I do.

1176
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,640
Good, because this is going to be
incredibly dangerous.

1177
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,400
One false move and we'll have betrayed the
security of the United Kingdom and be in prison

1178
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,720
for high treason. Magnussen is the most
dangerous man we've ever encountered

1179
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,400
and the odds are
comprehensively stacked against us.

1180
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,800
But it's Christmas! I feel the same.

1181
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,040
Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.
Did you bring your gun, as I suggested?

1182
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,960
Why would I bring my gun to your parents' house
for Christmas dinner?! Is it in your coat? Yes.

1183
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,480
Off we go, then. Where are we going?
Appledore.

1184
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,520
I would offer you a drink,
but it's very rare and expensive.

1185
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,800
Oh, it WAS you.

1186
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,560
Yes, of course.

1187
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,160
Very hard to find a pressure
point on you, Mr Holmes.

1188
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,080
The drugs thing
I never believed for a moment.

1189
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:55,360
Anyway, you wouldn't care
if it was exposed, would you?

1190
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,480
But look how you
care about John Watson.

1191
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,920
Your damsel in distress.

1192
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,240
You put me in a fire, for leverage?!

1193
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,000
Oh, I would never let you burn,
Dr Watson.

1194
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,440
I had people standing by.
I'm not a murderer.

1195
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,920
Unlike your wife.

1196
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,720
Let me explain how leverage works,
Dr Watson.

1197
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,520
For those who understand
these things,

1198
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,480
Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful
man in the country.

1199
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,680
Well, apart from me.

1200
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,800
Mycroft's pressure point is his
junkie detective brother, Sherlock.

1201
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,760
Sherlock's pressure point
is his best friend, John Watson.

1202
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,640
John Watson's pressure
point is his wife.

1203
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,880
I own John Watson's wife,
I own Mycroft.

1204
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,760
He's what I'm getting for Christmas.

1205
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,880
It's an exchange, not a gift.

1206
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,280
Forgive me, but...

1207
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,640
I already seem to have it.

1208
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,160
It's password protected.

1209
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,560
In return for the password,
you will give me any material

1210
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,680
in your possession pertaining to the
woman I know as Mary Watson.

1211
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:26,720
Oh, she's bad, that one.
So many dead people.

1212
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,360
You should see what I've seen.
I don't need to see it.

1213
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,120
You might enjoy it, though.
I enjoy it.

1214
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,240
Then why don't you show us?

1215
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,760
Show you Appledore?
The secret vaults.

1216
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,400
Is that what you want?

1217
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,720
I want everything you've
got on Mary.

1218
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,040
HE CHUCKLES

1219
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,120
You know, I honestly expected
something good.

1220
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,760
Oh, I think you'll find the contents of
that laptop... Include a GPS locator.

1221
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,680
By now your brother will
have noticed the theft

1222
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,560
and the security services will be
converging on this house.

1223
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,480
Having arrived, they'll find
top-secret information in my hands

1224
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,120
and they have every justification
to search my vaults.

1225
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,720
They will discover further
information of this kind

1226
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,640
and I will be imprisoned.

1227
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,200
You would be exonerated and restored
to your smelly little apartment

1228
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,960
to solve crimes with
Mr and Mrs Psychopath.

1229
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,520
Mycroft has been looking for this
opportunity for a long time.

1230
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,360
He'll be a very, very proud
big brother.

1231
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,800
The fact that you know it's going to
happen isn't going to stop it.

1232
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,600
Then why am I smiling? Ask me.

1233
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,480
Why are you smiling?

1234
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,480
Because Sherlock Holmes has made
one enormous mistake,

1235
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,880
which will destroy
the lives of everyone he loves.

1236
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,560
And everything he holds dear.

1237
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,160
Let me show you
the Appledore vaults.

1238
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,240
The entrance to my vaults.

1239
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,120
This is where I keep you all.

1240
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,040
OK, so where are the vaults, then?

1241
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,120
Vaults? What vaults? There are no
vaults beneath this building.

1242
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,560
They're all in here.

1243
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,000
The Appledore vaults
are my mind palace.

1244
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,560
You know about mind palaces,
don't you, Sherlock?

1245
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,640
How to store information so you
never forget it, by picturing it.

1246
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:15,360
I just sit here, I close my eyes
and down I go to my vaults.

1247
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,040
I can go anywhere inside my vaults.

1248
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,000
My memories.

1249
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,280
I'll look at the files
on Mrs Watson.

1250
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,720
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

1251
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:43,840
Hmm.

1252
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,280
Oh, this is one of my favourites.

1253
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,480
Oh, it's so exciting.

1254
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,560
All those wet jobs for the CIA.

1255
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,160
Ooh, she's gone a bit freelance now,
bad girl.

1256
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:10,360
HE CHUCKLES

1257
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,400
Oh, she's so wicked.

1258
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,800
I can really see why you like her.

1259
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,880
You see?

1260
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,080
So there are no documents, you don't
actually have anything here?

1261
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,880
Oh, sometimes
I send out for something,

1262
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,600
if I really need it,
but mostly I just remember it all.

1263
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,720
I don't understand.

1264
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,560
You should have that on a T-shirt.
You just remember it all?

1265
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,360
It's all about knowledge,
everything is. Knowing is owning.

1266
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,520
But if you just know it,
then you don't have proof.

1267
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,240
Proof? What would I need proof for?

1268
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,360
I'm in news, you moron.

1269
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,440
I don't have to prove it,
I just have to print it.

1270
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,360
Speaking of news...

1271
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,240
You'll both be heavily
featured tomorrow.

1272
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,600
Trying to sell state secrets to me.

1273
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,640
Tut tut.

1274
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,800
Let's go outside.
They'll be here shortly.

1275
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,600
Can't wait to see you arrested.

1276
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,680
Sherlock, do we have a plan?

1277
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,280
Sherlock?

1278
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,720
They're taking their time,
aren't they?

1279
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,160
I still don't understand.

1280
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,320
And there's the back of the T-shirt.

1281
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,640
You just know things -
how does that work?

1282
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,240
I just love your little soldier
face. I'd like to punch it.

1283
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,600
Bring it over here a minute.

1284
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,320
Come on. For Mary.
Bring me your face.

1285
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,080
HE CLEARS THROAT

1286
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,680
Lean forward a bit
and stick your face out.

1287
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,720
Please.

1288
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,800
Now, can I flick it?

1289
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,720
Look at me. Can I flick your face?

1290
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,040
I just love doing this.
I could do it all day.

1291
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,320
Well, it works like this, John.

1292
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,480
I know who Mary hurt and killed.

1293
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,480
I know where to find
people who hate her.

1294
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,960
I know where they live,
I know their phone numbers.

1295
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,120
All in my mind palace, all of it.

1296
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:46,520
I could phone them right now
and tear your whole life down...

1297
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,720
...and I will,

1298
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,120
unless you let me flick your face.

1299
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,200
This is what I do to people.

1300
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,280
This is what I do to
whole countries.

1301
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,040
Just because I know.

1302
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,160
Can I do your eye now?

1303
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,240
See if you can keep it open, hmm?

1304
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,400
Come on, for Mary. Keep it open.

1305
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,720
Sherlock?

1306
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,720
Let him. I'm sorry, just... let him.

1307
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,080
Hmm? Come on, eye open.

1308
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,960
MAGNUSSEN CHUCKLES

1309
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,280
It's difficult, isn't it?

1310
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,800
Janine managed to once.
She makes the funniest noises.

1311
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,840
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man.

1312
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,000
Here we go, Mr Holmes.

1313
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,240
To clarify, Appledore's vaults only
exist in your mind,

1314
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,400
nowhere else, just there?

1315
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,640
They're not real,
they never have been.

1316
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:06,040
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
step away!

1317
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,960
It's fine, they're harmless.

1318
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,640
'Target is not armed,
I repeat target is not armed.'

1319
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,920
Sherlock, what do we do?

1320
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,000
Nothing. There is
nothing to be done.

1321
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,840
Oh, I'm not a villain,
I have no evil plan.

1322
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,560
I'm a businessman, acquiring assets.
You happen to be one of them.

1323
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,480
Sorry, no chance for you to be
a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

1324
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:34,040
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man. Do it now!

1325
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,160
Oh, do your research.

1326
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:41,320
I'm not a hero,
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

1327
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,280
Merry Christmas!

1328
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,360
GUNSHOT

1329
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,440
'Man down, man down.'

1330
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,560
Get away from me,
John! Stay well back!

1331
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,560
Christ, Sherlock!

1332
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,720
Don't fire! Do not
fire on Sherlock Holmes!

1333
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,720
Do not fire!

1334
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,600
Oh Christ, Sherlock!

1335
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,840
Give my love to Mary.
Tell her she's safe now.

1336
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,280
Oh, Sherlock.

1337
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,000
What have you done?

1338
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,160
As my colleague is
fond of remarking,

1339
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,400
this country sometimes needs
a blunt instrument.

1340
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,160
Equally,
it sometimes needs a dagger,

1341
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:04,520
a scalpel wielded with precision
and without remorse.

1342
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:11,200
There will always come a time
when we need Sherlock Holmes.

1343
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:15,320
If this is some expression
of familial sentiment...

1344
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,520
Don't be absurd.

1345
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,560
I am not given to
outbursts of brotherly compassion.

1346
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,440
You know what
happened to the other one.

1347
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:28,160
In any event, there is no prison in
which we could incarcerate Sherlock

1348
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,520
without causing a riot
on a daily basis.

1349
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:37,240
The alternative, however,
would require your approval.

1350
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,160
Hardly merciful, Mr Holmes.

1351
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:44,280
Regrettably, Lady Smallwood,
my brother is a murderer.

1352
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,760
You will look after him for me,
won't you?

1353
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,880
Hmm. Don't worry.
I'll keep him in trouble.

1354
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,000
That's my girl.

1355
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,320
Since this is likely to be the last
conversation I'll have with John Watson,

1356
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,240
would you mind if we took a moment?

1357
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,960
So here we are.

1358
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,000
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.

1359
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,120
Sorry?

1360
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,640
That's the whole of it.
If you're looking for baby names.

1361
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,960
WATSON CHUCKLES

1362
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,800
No, we've had a scan,
we're pretty sure it's a girl.

1363
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,200
Oh. OK.

1364
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,400
Yeah.

1365
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,000
You know, actually, I can't
think of a single thing to say.

1366
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,360
No, neither can I.

1367
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,400
The game is over.

1368
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,280
The game is never over, John.

1369
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,320
But there may be some
new players now.

1370
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,880
That's OK, the East Wind takes us
all in the end. What's that?

1371
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,120
It's a story my brother told me
when we were kids.

1372
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:10,640
The East Wind is a terrifying force
that lays waste to all in its path.

1373
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:14,080
It seeks out the unworthy
and plucks them from the earth.

1374
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,280
That was generally me.

1375
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,720
Nice(!)
He's a rubbish big brother.

1376
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:24,200
So what about you, then?
Where are you actually going now?

1377
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,800
Oh, some undercover
work in Eastern Europe.

1378
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,200
For how long?

1379
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:33,400
Six months, my brother estimates.
He's never wrong.

1380
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,480
And then what?

1381
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,080
Who knows?

1382
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:51,160
John, there's something I should
say, I've meant to say always

1383
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,600
and I never have.

1384
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,520
Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet
again, I might as well say it now.

1385
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,480
Sherlock is actually a girl's name.

1386
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,080
It's not.

1387
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,280
It was worth a try.

1388
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,520
We're not naming our daughter
after you.

1389
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,040
Oh, I think it could work.

1390
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,520
To the very best of times, John.

1391
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,200
TV: 'Smith brings it inside.
This looks good.

1392
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,160
'Cassandra comes in for a shot.
Ooh, he missed it!'

1393
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,760
Oi, there's something wrong with the telly.
There's something wrong with the telly, mate.

1394
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,280
Who's that?

1395
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,840
DISTORTED VOICE: Did you miss me?

1396
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,080
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1397
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,760
How is this possible?

1398
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,600
We don't know, but it's on every
screen in the country.

1399
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,080
Every screen simultaneously.

1400
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,000
Has the Prime Minister been told?

1401
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,360
And Mycroft?

1402
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,440
But that's not possible. That is
simply not possible.

1403
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:47,600
What's happened?
Sir? It's your brother.

1404
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,680
Mycroft?

1405
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,120
'Hello, little brother.
How's the exile going?'

1406
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,600
I've only been gone four minutes.

1407
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,800
Well, I certainly hope you've
learnt your lesson.

1408
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,640
'As it turns out, you're needed.'

1409
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,760
Oh, for God's sake,
make up your mind!

1410
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,120
Who needs me this time?

1411
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,720
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1412
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,320
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?'

1413
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,880
England.

1414
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,480
But he's dead. I mean, you told me
he was dead, Moriarty?

1415
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,360
Absolutely. Blew his own brains out.

1416
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,360
So how can he be back?

1417
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:24,640
Well if he is,
he'd better wrap up warm.

1418
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,120
There's an East Wind coming.

1419
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,480
Miss me?

1420
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,060
