1
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,700
- But if we...

2
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,497
but how can...

3
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:29,230
- jesus christ.

4
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,996
- So this means that,
uh...

5
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,196
- so no one killed
any homeless men.

6
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,028
- No serial killer.

7
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:43,761
Some were random killings,
some were natural deaths

8
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,893
That were likely manipulated.

9
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,427
But they're not linked
in any way.

10
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:48,760
- But why?

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,460
- The detectives used
the money to fund a case

12
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,926
Against the drug
traffickers responsible

13
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:53,826
For the slayings in
the vacants a year ago.

14
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,825
- Last week's arrests and
seizures were a direct result.

15
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,891
- So let me just
understand this...

16
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,790
so i've been going out there
for weeks,

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,957
Slamming the governor for
his neglect of the

18
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:08,558
Homeless and declaring
how we will stop

19
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:09,656
At nothing to findhe
person responsible for

20
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:11,889
Preying on the homeless
and all the while--

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,556
Hey, norman,
this is my ass here.

22
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,522
- That's true, boss.

23
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,955
But it does have a
certain charm to it.

24
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,254
They manufactured
an issue to get paid,

25
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:23,987
We manufactured an
issue to get you

26
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,354
Elected governor.

27
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:28,387
Everybody's gettin'
what they need behind

28
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,287
Some make-Believe.

29
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,953
- The detectives involved
will be suspended and

30
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,486
Ultimately fired,
at the least.

31
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,553
Beyond that,
a criminal prosecution

32
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,752
On fraud and perjury
charges is probable.

33
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:39,951
- So, what, you're saying
we call a press conference

34
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,251
And we say,
"hey, by the way,

35
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,951
"All that stuff about homeless
people getting killed and

36
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,917
"The governor cutting
the safety net and us doing

37
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:49,184
"Everything in our power
to catch the guy,

38
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,582
Hey, guess what,
the joke's on us?"

39
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:53,383
- Not to mention that
the evidence against

40
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:56,715
The traffickers arrested
last week is tainted.

41
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,981
That case could
collapse as well.

42
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:00,581
- I don't fucking
believe this.

43
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:03,215
You two are on point here.

44
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:04,680
Word of this gets
down to annapolis,

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,181
The governor's
gonna wreck me with it.

46
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,548
And if it comes to that,
you guys drop on your swords,

47
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:09,548
So help me.

48
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:10,646
- How does word
not get out

49
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:14,280
Once we suspend
the detectives?

50
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,045
Never mind sending it
to the grand jury

51
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:20,245
- The cops that did this,
they gotta go.

52
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,244
You cannot be telling me
i have to live with this.

53
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,811
- Deputy, counselor...

54
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,278
if you two will excuse us,
we are going to

55
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,743
Discuss this first as
a matter of public policy.

56
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,643
Until we can reason the
best way to address this,

57
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:34,009
Do nothing and speak
to no one

58
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:35,443
About any of this.

59
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:38,242
- If this becomes
public in the wrong way,

60
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,108
A lot of people who
were legally responsible

61
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:41,908
For the situation,
good people

62
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:45,308
Who were nonetheless in a
supervisory role here...

63
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:47,207
are going to suffer.

64
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:49,174
And that's not the
outcome that anyone wants.

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,839
- What mike is saying is
that we need to

66
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,339
Be very careful
about how to proceed.

67
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,071
- I wish i was still
at the newspaper

68
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,737
So i could write
on this mess.

69
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,936
It's too fuckin' good.

77
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:07,583
We don't have anything
scheduled from you today,

78
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,451
I don't think...

79
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,183
- 40,000 from the showboat
on the boardwalk.

80
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:20,149
26 at the borgata.

80 over the last
year at the taj mahal...

82
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,148
and that's just the
atlantic city casinos.

83
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:29,014
- I like to play. So what?

84
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,347
- You lost three times
your salary over

85
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:32,746
The last two years.

86
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:35,780
I ran you through sentinel
title and came back

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,346
With seven pages of liens
and a third mortgage

88
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,545
You folded on two months ago.

89
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,278
Gary, you're done.

90
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,512
- What do you mean?

91
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,711
- We found sealed grand
jury papers in the houses

92
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,210
Of drug dealers.

93
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,210
And we've got people
naming you on it.

94
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:56,143
You have a problem, gary.

95
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,143
But you have friends
in this courthouse,

96
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:00,709
Lifelong friends.

97
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:03,409
Cop to the problem,
give up the names of those

98
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,275
That bought from you.

99
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,573
Disbarred? Yeah, no doubt.

100
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:10,707
But you play it clean
from this moment on,

101
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,273
And we both know
you'll probably walk.

102
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,706
- Why did you look at me?

103
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:18,407
- I ran the finances
on everyone who worked

104
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:20,339
This unit over the
last couple years.

105
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:21,738
You were the only bogie.

106
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:23,439
If the s.A.O. Weren't
so screwed up,

107
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,972
They'd have been
running background

108
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:26,204
Checks as a routine.

109
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,804
But i guess you knew that.

110
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:32,404
- I always wondered if they'd
get their shit together.

111
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:34,504
But that's baltimore,
isn't it?

112
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:40,269
So what happens now?

113
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,102
- Well, for starters...

114
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:48,534
you're gonna make
a phone call.

115
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,334
- Mcnulty, freamon,

116
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:54,666
Sydnor,

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,433
Anyone who has the smell of
this on them should be gone.

118
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,366
Before the close of business,
they should be suspended

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,099
And before the end
of the week, indicted.

120
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,298
- I know, but...
- But what?

121
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,831
We're gonna let this shit
stand because it'll

122
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,465
Hurt carcetti to air it out?

123
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,064
Instead of cleaning
house like we need to,

124
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,663
He's up there figuring
out how to hide the dirt.

125
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,131
I swear, i gotta mind
to call the governor myself

126
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,131
And just let it fly.

127
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,196
- Cedric, you can't.
- Why not?

128
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,996
If i let this thing stand,
i might as well just

129
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,996
Roll over and play dead
for every police

130
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:20,195
Who knows about this.

131
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,229
We cover this up...

132
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,727
- cedric, you can't
do anything.

133
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:28,727
Those are your detectives.

134
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,395
They need someone to blame,
they will measure you for it...

135
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:32,993
- i don't give a fuck.

136
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:37,394
- And they'll fire me.

137
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,292
You heard steintorf...

138
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:48,524
i was in charge of this thing.

139
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,524
I was on that wiretap...

140
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,656
this is my career.

141
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:55,957
This is everything.

142
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:05,621
You go public,
and it hurts carcetti.

143
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,688
Maybe he doesn't get
to be governor.

144
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:12,021
But he is still the mayor
and bond is still my boss

145
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,886
And you know the weight
will not fall on them.

146
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,186
It never does.

147
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,353
- Christ.

148
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:20,819
- Everything
i've worked for, all those years

149
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,618
In that courthouse...

150
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,084
please.

151
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:36,683
- 25 cents.
"Baltimore sun."

152
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,383
Sir, "baltimore sun."
One quarter.

153
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:48,647
- Keep it.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

154
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:52,314
- People tip pretty good,
don't they?

155
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,447
- Paining for what
he had done to us.

156
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,447
I'm sorry for him, man,
really, but i still

157
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,645
Can't let him come up
from the basement.

158
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,778
You gonna put all
that in the paper?

159
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,711
- That's the plan.

160
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,544
- Even the parts
about sherrod?

161
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:10,877
- Yeah.

162
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,411
- What good is...

163
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,609
what good is a story
like that?

164
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,176
- Like what?

165
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:20,709
- Me, sherrod.
Gettin' high. Not gettin' high.

166
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,142
My sister,
all that shit in there.

167
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,142
What good do any of that
do to put it in the newspaper?

168
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,575
- People read it,
they think about it.

169
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:27,608
Maybe see things different.

170
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,774
- I don't know, man.

171
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:30,907
- Bubs, you don't
want me to do this,

172
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,041
I won't do it.

173
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,506
- I don't know.

174
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,973
"Baltimore sun."
A little bit of sun.

175
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:41,406
Sun paper.

176
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:42,705
- Look, rupert,
you can go public with

177
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:43,772
This thing if you want,

178
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:46,006
But your shop is going
to come out looking

179
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:47,271
Worse for letting it
happen in the first place.

180
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,504
- The better move is
to shut it down quietly

181
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:50,904
And then deal with
those responsible

182
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,437
Through back channels.

183
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,170
We'll bury these guys softly,

184
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,870
And in a hole so deep
no one will ever get close

185
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,204
To digging them up.

186
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:03,535
- I can see that.

187
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,801
- Commissioner,
do you agree?

188
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:10,035
- Well, it is a
little more problematic for me.

189
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,633
The offenders are in my shop,
are they not?

190
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:19,433
- Can i have a word with you
in private, bill?

191
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:22,733
- Hey, if rawls isn't in,
i'm not either.

192
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,165
- Oh, i wouldn't worry
about bill rawls.

193
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:27,531
I believe he's about to
have one of those road

194
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,931
To damascus moments....

195
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,264
- i can see what
you're thinking in there.

196
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,629
I can see the gears
grinding in that head

197
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,997
Of yours.

198
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,996
You're thinking, hey,
i might have some wood

199
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,495
On carcetti here.

200
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:44,829
After all, there's no way
they can pin the blame

201
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,795
On me for this fiasco
without doing their

202
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,395
Boy daniels, too, right?

203
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,828
You're thinking we'd have
to fire daniels

204
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,761
To fire you and
that wouldn't sit well

205
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,394
Given how much we've
already sold daniels.

206
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,693
Isn't that what you're thinking?

207
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:56,827
And so you're telling
yourself maybe there's

208
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:58,626
A way for you
to leverage this.

209
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,859
To get yourself a full
term as commissioner,

210
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,293
To delay daniels a
few more years in

211
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:04,026
Exchange for you
shutting the fuck up

212
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,459
And doing what
you're told.

213
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:08,359
And you know what, bill?
You're not far off.

214
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,292
You do have a little
leverage here,

215
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,623
But just a little.

216
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:14,490
And i wouldn't overplay
your hand.

217
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,191
- How would you play it?

218
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,490
- I'd shut the fuck up
and wait your turn,

219
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:18,856
And when tommy gets
to the statehouse,

220
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:20,756
He brings you
with him to be state

221
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,990
Police superintendent,

222
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,822
Because while you may be
a shade too white

223
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:28,022
To run the baltimore
department,

224
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:35,388
You're just about right
for the m.S.P.

225
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,786
- I have your word?

226
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:38,486
- And i have yours.

227
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:50,784
- Back channel is
the way to go.

228
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:51,918
- See?

229
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:54,783
The police commissioner
done fell off his ass.

230
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,016
- Can i help you?

231
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:06,349
- Um, i need to see
mr. Prezbo.

232
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:08,848
- Someone will come down.

233
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,345
- Are you a student here?

234
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,978
- Ms. Donnelly, it's me,
duquan.

235
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,044
- Well, it's good to see
you, duquan,

236
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:37,676
But you're not a student
here so i can't

237
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:39,643
Let you inside.

238
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,010
- I just came past to see
mr. Prezbo.

239
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,475
- Well, he's teaching
right now.

240
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:46,909
- I know. I can wait.

241
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,775
- Well, you're gonna
have to stay outside,

242
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:50,574
And after the bell,
i'll tell

243
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,408
Mr. Pryzbylewski you're out
here for him, okay?

244
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,839
- I'm going to surprise
you with something.

245
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,205
- You already have.

246
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:09,705
- I got a tip from
an informant about a

247
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,072
Leak out of the grand
jury unit,

248
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,004
Sad to say it's
checked out.

249
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,204
- We know about the leak.

250
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:17,171
- Yeah, but do you
know who it is?

251
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,237
Gary dipasquale.

252
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,337
Decent enough guy,
but he's got a bear of

253
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:23,103
A gambling problem
and a bank of

254
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,669
Drug lawyers who are
willing to pay for

255
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,035
Their look-Sees.

256
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,302
Troy sanders, marvin bronfman,

257
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:31,500
Dennis cray, sid silverstein.

258
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,801
And the pick
of the litter? Maurice levy.

259
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:38,334
I kid you not.

260
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,833
- Gary is their leak?

261
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,033
- He broke right away.

262
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,799
He was ready to give it up.
He needed to.

263
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,966
One-Party consent
call implicating maury levy.

264
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,432
- Where's gary now?

265
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,165
- He went up to the second
floor to hand

266
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,931
In his letter of
resignation, then he went home

267
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,231
To wait for the sword
to drop.

268
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:59,697
He's oy,
he's better than you'd think.

269
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,629
You know, if we can turn
levy and some of these

270
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:05,229
Other drug lawyers,
we can route the drug

271
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,262
Money all over town.

272
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,661
It's sad business,
i know, but at least

273
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:13,429
We know the truth now,
right?

274
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,428
- The truth, you say?

275
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,458
- Hey.
- Duquan, hello.

276
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:27,458
- Snatch-Pops.

277
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:30,326
- Hey!- Damien. You lost

278
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,391
- But i said snatch-Pops.
- I don't care what you said.

279
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,857
You're gonna buy him
a new sandwich,

280
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,958
And past that, you're gonna
go inside and ask mr. Williams

281
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:37,358
For a broom to clean that up,
you understand?

282
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,690
- But, mr. P...

283
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,057
- right now, damien,
orou're mine for another

284
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,190
Week of detention.

285
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,790
I don't want to hear
another word.

286
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,922
- Looks like you got
the hang of it.

287
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,088
- What's up with you, duquan?

288
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,088
- Oh, ain't nothing.

289
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,422
- You still at southwestern?

290
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:58,720
- Well, i'm, like, needing
a semester off,

291
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,987
You know?

292
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:02,054
I'm outdoors now.

293
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:05,619
And, um...

294
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:08,420
i was hoping maybe i
could get with you

295
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,952
And borrow some money,

296
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,651
So i could get a place
and some clean clothes

297
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:14,685
And get myself
settled so i can go back

298
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:16,951
To school.

299
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,450
- You're on the street?

300
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,884
- I mean, i got some people
ready to give me

301
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,350
A really, really good place
if i can come up

302
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:22,716
With some money for it.

303
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,416
- How much do you need?

304
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,282
- Couple hundred.

305
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:32,416
But if you could go
one fifty more,

306
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,014
I could enroll
in the g.E.D. Program

307
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,514
Down b.C.C.C.

308
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,214
Then i could get my
g.E.D. Without having

309
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:39,513
To go back to southwestern,

310
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,113
Then i could get
my work permit.

311
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,213
- I don't think
you're eligible for

312
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,812
A g.E.D. Program if
you're still of age

313
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,912
To attend high school,
duquan.

314
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,679
- Yeah, you are.

315
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,178
- I'll tell you what.

316
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,843
Give me a couple minutes,
i'll drive you down there.

317
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:00,044
And if you are eligible,
i'll write a check

318
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:01,344
Right to the bursar's
office down there.

319
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,510
- Naw, mr. P., you ain't
got to through all that.

320
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,742
Besides, i really ain't
got the time to

321
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,609
Go down there today.

322
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,209
But, you know, i'm gonna.

323
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,608
- I can do it, duquan,
if that's what you want.

324
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,640
And i don't even care
about the money.

325
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,874
But understand i'm gonna
go down to b.C.C.C.

326
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:24,173
In a few days and find
out if you're enrolled.

327
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:26,572
If you are,
i'm gonna say, "great,

328
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:28,471
"Duquan can come past
with his certificate

329
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,438
"When he gets it,
and we're still friends

330
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:33,939
And he can still
rely on me."

331
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:38,271
But if you aren't enrolled,
then...

332
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:41,103
well, i imagine i'm not
gonna see you again,

333
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:42,270
Am i?

334
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,304
- No, mr. P.

335
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,070
I'm definitely gonna enroll.

336
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:47,735
You'll see.

337
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,068
- I'll get my stuff.

338
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,402
I'll meet you in the lot
and we'll go find

339
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:56,701
A bank machine.

340
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,034
- Jay, all i'm saying
is we've run down

341
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:05,732
All the leads we had,
all the office reports

342
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:08,099
Are in and at this point,
barring any new developments,

343
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,266
I don't need all
this fucking manpower.

344
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:11,765
- Fuck me, jimmy.

345
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,365
Last week you were crying
for every swinging

346
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:14,598
Dick you could get
your hands on.

347
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:15,998
- Well, the case
has gone quiet.

348
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,031
There's no red ribbons.
There's no bodies.

349
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,298
There's no disappearances.

350
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,398
There's not a fucking
word on the cell phone.

351
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,630
This thing's fucking
thing is useless.

352
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,896
- So what? You don't want
the wiretap either now?

353
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:25,763
- Well, the judge gave
us 60 days,

354
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:27,096
Once that runs out,
then...

355
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:28,330
- motherfucker,
you were the one who was

356
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:30,628
All semper fi for this
serial killer

357
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,929
And now you're fuckin'
the dog.

358
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:33,528
- Jay, i'm ready
to work the case.

359
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:35,560
But short of any new
leads or developments,

360
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,361
What the fuck do you
want me to do?

361
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,927
I can't make shit up,
can i?

362
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,860
It is what it is.

363
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,526
- If i send the
surveillance teams back, jimmy,

364
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,792
Don't come crying for
more manpower tomorrow.

365
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:48,926
You hear?

366
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,959
- Shit is like a war,
ain't it?

367
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,358
Easy to get in,
hell to geout.

368
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,855
- Pearlman
knows everything. Daniels, too.

369
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:18,021
They figured it out.

370
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,687
- How?
- I don't know.

371
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,954
- Jesus.
What are they...

372
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:24,920
- i don't know.

373
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,120
She made it clear
in no uncertain terms

374
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,387
There are not to be any
further homeless killings.

375
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:30,518
Nothing more on this
case whatsoever.

376
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,585
- Does she know about marlo,
that our case--

377
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:33,785
- She knows everything.

378
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:36,285
Daniels knows.

379
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,318
They went down to the
e.C.U., dialed up the wiretap

380
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,784
Number and up pop's
marlo's cell phone.

381
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:43,950
- Why aren't we fired?
Why aren't we in fucking
bracelets?

382
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,250
- I don't know.

383
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:48,149
- Oh shit, lester.

384
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:50,649
We gotta get outta here.

385
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,182
We gotta think this
thing through.

386
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:54,547
Oh, jesus fucking christ.

387
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:56,348
- Look, meet me down
at kavanaugh's in ten minutes,

388
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:57,714
All right?

389
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:09,679
- Jimmy?

390
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,009
- How much?

391
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:41,674
- Two hundred.

392
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:42,908
- Damn, boy.

393
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,140
Teacher must love
your black ass.

394
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,307
C'mon with it.

395
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,472
They gonna put out testers
up on poplar grove.

396
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,006
We gonna be late for it.

397
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,703
C'mon, boy. C'mon.

398
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:04,904
C'mon.

399
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,767
- Deputy...

400
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,663
- to be continued.

401
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,363
- Fuck fuck fucking fuck.

402
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,394
- Ah, what's the matter?

403
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:58,461
Cottage cheese for lunch
again there, carl?

404
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,426
- Just because it happened
doesn't mean it's news.

405
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,960
There's always a
salmonella outbreak somewhere.

406
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,893
I don't see why we have to
cover this one...

407
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:12,093
- what's the first rule
of rewrite, spry?

408
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:13,525
- Shoot it down.

409
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,892
- Did you read this?

410
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:20,390
We are crediting our
own coverage with

411
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,291
Changing the
governor's mind?

412
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,157
I'm already to the jump
and there's not a

413
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,589
Quote from anyone
crediting us

414
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:28,789
With anything of the sort.

415
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,956
- Yeah, the guv
is restoring funding, all right.

416
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,622
That's 'cause carcetti's
been beating the shit

417
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,289
Out of him
on this issue.

418
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:35,755
We're just an afterthought.

419
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:38,289
- Whiting can smell the
public service pulitzer, huh?

420
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,687
- Seems so.

421
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:40,854
- You get a chance yet?

422
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:42,754
- Yeah, yeah. I read it.

423
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:43,954
- And?

424
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,120
- Beautiful.

425
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:49,887
No, no, no. I mean it.

426
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,652
You got some real joe mitchell
stuff on the page there.

427
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:55,585
Really makes me feel like
i know this guy and his world.

428
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:57,851
You just pulled it all
through the keyhole.

429
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,051
- Thanks, gus.

430
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,751
- We get some good art,
i'm gonna push for

431
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:01,885
The sunday front.

432
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:03,084
- Well, the thing is,
i gotta make sure

433
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:04,284
The guy is good
with it.

434
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:05,583
- What do you mean?

435
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:07,217
- The part of the story about
the kid still bothers him,

436
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:09,250
And when he told me about it,
he was just talking...

437
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:10,782
- you told him you were
writing about him, right?

438
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:12,216
- I know, but...

439
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:13,415
i'm putting the guy's
life out there.

440
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:14,682
I just wanna feel
clean about it.

441
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:16,615
You know what i'm sayin'?

442
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,315
- I remember clean.

443
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,014
- Obviously,
they're not in a hurry

444
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:24,513
To go public
'cause we ain't cuffed.

445
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:26,413
- They're pretending on this
case like we're pretending.

446
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,713
Why?

447
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,579
- Carcetti.
He's exposed on this.

448
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,945
- How? Just blame it all on us,
on the department.

449
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:38,112
- To kill us, they'd
have to kill rawls, daniels,

450
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:39,744
And half the chain
of command.

451
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:42,444
And he made those guys.
It's his police department.

452
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,311
So he opens himself
up right when he's out

453
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,710
There running for governor.

454
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:48,310
- So they want us
to do what?

455
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,543
Run this thing down quietly?

456
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:50,643
That's no problem.

457
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:52,209
- Six months from now,
after the election,

458
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:55,042
They might decide to open up
and grand jury us.

459
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:58,275
We could still go to jail,
and if not,

460
00:22:58,374 --> 00:23:00,342
I'd expect to be back
in the pawn shop unit

461
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:01,507
And you, my brother,
are gonna ride the boat.

462
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:05,241
- So what?
It was worth it.

463
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:06,406
Wasn't it?

464
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:08,840
- Depends.

465
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,672
Are they gonna let
the case against marlo

466
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:13,973
And his people stand,
knowing what they know?

467
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,106
- Why wouldn't they?

468
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,671
It still works on the
seizures and cell phones.

469
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,005
It works without
the illegal tap.

470
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:19,571
- Yeah, it does.

471
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:21,938
And they made a big deal
about dropping marlo.

472
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:23,503
They called that press
conference

473
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:25,004
And linked him to
all the bodies.

474
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,137
- For them to drop
the case now...

475
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:30,402
- you know, you think
about it...

476
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:35,302
we've got almost as much
on them as they do on us.

477
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,102
- That tom wolfe wannabe
thinks he's gonna

478
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:39,468
Get a phrase like that
past me?

479
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:41,134
No fuckin' way,
motherfucker.

480
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:50,100
- It's like a sweater with
the threads hanging off.

481
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,599
Pull any thread...

482
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,266
mostly exaggerations
and too-Perfect quotes,

483
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,999
Sometimes on-The-Record.

484
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:59,464
I called some of them back,

485
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:02,798
Asked if they really
said those things.

486
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:03,931
You know what the city
housing commissioner told me

487
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:05,563
About the quotes in
the flipping story?

488
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:06,563
- Hmm?

489
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,563
- He wished he'd said
some of them,

490
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,963
But that he'd never been
that smart in his life.

491
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,696
Somee takes
the time to...

492
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:16,495
re-Report this stuff,
it'll get ugly.

493
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,828
What're you gonna do?

494
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:22,329
- I don't know, robert.
I don't know.

495
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,827
- Keep my name out of it.

496
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:36,259
- No bail.

497
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:37,992
They're claiming a
propensity for violence and

498
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:40,092
Witness intimidation at
the bail review,

499
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,924
Trying to have you held
as the kingpin.

500
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:42,991
- They can do that?

501
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:44,058
- They can try.

502
00:24:44,158 --> 00:24:47,325
Depends on which
judge they draw.

503
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:49,324
- So they ain't got no
bail for chris, right?

504
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,523
I mean, he got the
murder warrant.

505
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,023
- Monk neither.

506
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,022
Too much weight in his car
and he's on parole from

507
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:55,223
The '04 charge.

508
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:58,056
Best i could do was spring
mr. Wagstaff on 300,000.

509
00:24:58,189 --> 00:24:59,323
- He show that kind
of money?

510
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:00,554
- Put up his uncle's house
on surety bond

511
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:01,654
For a third of it.

512
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:04,188
Bondsman is fronting
the rest on a fake lien.

513
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,720
Right now, the important
thing is not bail,

514
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,753
The important thing
is this...

515
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,919
i need you to tell me who
else knew your clock code.

516
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,552
- I told you.

517
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:20,918
Me, cheese, monk, chris
and the supply. That's it.

518
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,085
- No one else.

519
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:23,351
- No one else even had
my cell number.

520
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,117
Except you.

521
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:30,317
What?

522
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,482
- There's a lie
in here somewhere.

523
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,549
- I ain't lyin'.

524
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:34,783
- I don't mean you.

525
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:37,481
Look, the police say
a source told them

526
00:25:37,615 --> 00:25:39,715
That you were re-Upping
on the day,

527
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:41,115
And word of that
might have slipped out.

528
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,581
That's possible.

529
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,215
I mean, if you were
wholesaling all over town...

530
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:46,380
but they only grab your
cells when they arrest you

531
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:49,247
And then they have to
go get warrants

532
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:51,580
Before they can look at
the photos on the phones.

533
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,913
And it's only when they
get to the photos

534
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,079
And break the code

535
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,846
That they have enough to
type a charging document

536
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,512
For you or chris, right?

537
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:01,744
I mean, you aren't
caught with drugs.

538
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,411
But they had the arrest
warrants on both of you

539
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:05,111
Within a couple hours.

540
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:09,211
Which means that they broke
the code almost instantly,

541
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:11,376
In no time at all.

542
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:13,709
- They wiretapped me.

543
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:16,442
- My investigator
thinks so.

544
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,843
But he says he doesn't
know for sure which

545
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,641
Unit ran the tap,
or who manned it.

546
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:22,808
It doesn't add up.

547
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:31,706
- You gettin' out.

548
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,339
You ain't.

549
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,072
You hit the streets,
you round up as much

550
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:40,638
Muscle as possible
and get that boy.

551
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,371
- He did snoop cuz
he knew we was on him.

552
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,971
- He knew we was on him cuz
he the one talked about

553
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,271
The damn re-Up.

554
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,037
Get your shit together,
man.

555
00:26:51,137 --> 00:26:53,204
The bondsman came in
with levy.

556
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,070
- A'ight. I'm on it.

557
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,267
- Hey, man, you got a dollar?

558
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,800
C'mon.

559
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:38,095
- Hey, pal.

560
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:39,628
Hey.

561
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:42,129
Hey.

562
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,862
Pal, you all right?

563
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:47,961
- Okay, here it comes...

564
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:50,793
the dreaded crab claw.

565
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:55,526
You know what happens
when crab claw goes...

566
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,859
it's all crab tonight...
- No crab claw!

567
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,026
- Yes, crab claw!

568
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:02,825
Yeah!
Crab claw does it again.

569
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,091
Six!

570
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:05,192
Six and i'm out...

571
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,323
yeah?

572
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,390
Where?

573
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:16,422
You're fucking kidding me.

574
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:18,556
It's more bull...

575
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,621
it's bogus, jay.
I'm telling you...

576
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:26,454
okay.

577
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,121
I gotta go.

578
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,986
I have to keep
running the string out.

579
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,220
I have no choice.

580
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,753
- You said
the bosses know.

581
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:38,220
- Yeah.
Some do, some don't.

582
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,052
The ones that do
want us to keep pretending.

583
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,785
We stop pretending,
then...

584
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,084
listen, we'll finish
this tomorrow night, okay?

585
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:51,650
I'll see you in a bit.

586
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:03,215
- What do you think?

587
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:08,314
I mean, puttin' my shit
in the streets, huh?

588
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,247
- Well, it's you.

589
00:29:13,346 --> 00:29:14,513
He's got you.

590
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:17,146
- Yeah, well...

591
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,879
- i mean he's got
what you're about.

592
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:22,945
The guy likes you,
that shows through.

593
00:29:23,045 --> 00:29:25,112
I mean, you know,
he's saying this giving

594
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:26,912
Back that you're doing,
he's putting

595
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:29,443
That up against sherrod.

596
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:33,244
And he ain't lettin' you
off the hook for shit, but...

597
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:34,277
he's just puttin'
it all out there.

598
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:35,709
You know, the good
and the bad.

599
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,277
- Know what?

600
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:42,142
The bad don't bother me
to have out there.

601
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:44,209
Shit, i know the bad.

602
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:47,108
I ain't lyin' to no one
about the bad.

603
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,474
- Scared of somebody
callin' you good?

604
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,274
- A lot of folks
volunteer places.

605
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:55,807
A lot of people
share at meetings.

606
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,040
Plenty of motherfuckers
wake up every day

607
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,906
And not get high.

608
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,839
Man makin' me sound special
for doin' what the fuck

609
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:02,139
I need to be doin'.

610
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,671
- Read it, sucka.

611
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:19,170
- "You can hold back from
the suffering of the world,

612
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,302
"You have free
permission to do so,

613
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,568
"And it is in accordance
with your nature,

614
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,802
"But perhaps this very
holding back is the one

615
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:29,201
Suffering you could
have avoided."

616
00:30:30,268 --> 00:30:32,867
Fan-Zee kafka.

617
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,034
Who's he?

618
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,499
- Some writer.

619
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,633
- You read his books?

620
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:39,033
- Fuck no.

621
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,199
But you remember flubber?

622
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,999
He handed that to me
the night that

623
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,931
He had me start leading
the saint martin meeting.

624
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:50,297
I kept it ever since.

625
00:30:51,764 --> 00:30:53,296
- What it mean to you?

626
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,529
- You want these?

627
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:01,562
- Yeah, my man say he
need it back and

628
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:02,929
Not to make any copies.

629
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,995
He sayin' he ain't
supposed to show it

630
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:07,928
To me before it goes
in the paper.

631
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:09,327
I mean, if i let him.

632
00:31:09,427 --> 00:31:10,828
- You gonna?

633
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,660
- Thanks for the crabs.

634
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,859
- Yep.

635
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,725
- Gray van.

636
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:26,525
You get the tag?

637
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,491
- I couldn't see it
from where i was.

638
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:30,057
- Describe the driver.

639
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,024
- White. Six foot.

640
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:35,124
Not heavy,
not skinny either.

641
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:36,422
- Clothes?

642
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:38,823
- Nothing i noticed.
Kinda non-Descript.

643
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:40,422
- Non-Descript?

644
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,855
- I was surprised, i guess.

645
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:43,688
I ju thought, whoa,
what's he doing?

646
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,822
- Funny it bein'
you to see this.

647
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,821
- It's weird. If an interview
doesn't run late,

648
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:50,654
I'm not even here tonight.

649
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:52,888
You mind if i get inside?
I gotta check in with my desk.

650
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:55,120
You need anything else,
you got my number.

651
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,254
- Yeah.

652
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,719
- That guy's an asshole.

653
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,317
This smokehound
can't remember a thing.

654
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:07,484
Only motherfucker he
remembers messin'

655
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:09,284
With him is the fella
that found him.

656
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,785
Whatever happened before
that is anyone's guess.

657
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,750
- Hey.

658
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,750
Someone try to kidnap you?

659
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:19,083
Drag you into a van?

660
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:20,183
- Ok.

661
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:22,682
- Who was trying to hurt you?
- My father.

662
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,681
But he was a drunk.

663
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:26,548
- Detective,
there's a vagrant over here

664
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,214
- What did you see, fella?

665
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:40,713
- Mcnulty?

666
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:43,378
Johnny weaver. Tactical.

667
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:44,812
- Fuck you.
Why didn't you say so?

668
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:45,812
- J.W.

669
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:47,246
Tryin' to keep your cover,
huh?

670
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:48,278
It's better for everyone
down here thinks i'm

671
00:32:48,377 --> 00:32:50,211
One of the regulars,
right?

672
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,344
Anyway, what's the
ruckus with petey?

673
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:54,310
-The drunk?
- Yeah.

674
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:57,543
Sun reporter says he's
going into his building,

675
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:58,610
He sees a guy trying
to drag him into

676
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,575
A grey van.

677
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:01,976
It's bullshit, right?

678
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:03,509
- Yeah. Petey was layin'
there forty-Five minutes

679
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,308
Before that preppy cocksucker
even parks his car.

680
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:08,075
- Thanks.
- No problem.

681
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,574
Hey, gimme a dollar,
make it look right.

682
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,340
- Thank you, johnny.

683
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:18,273
- What about the reporter?

684
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:22,639
You could charge
false statement, you know.

685
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,773
- You lock up every liar,
there's no room in b.D.C.

686
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:26,838
For anyone else, right?

687
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,172
More trouble than it's worth.

688
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:31,171
Jay, it's horseshit.
I'm goin' home.

689
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,138
Yeah.

690
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:15,930
- Brought home some crabs.

691
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,964
- I already made dinner.

692
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:18,964
- Put 'em in the fridge.

693
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:20,429
Cold for lunch tomorrow
if you like.

694
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:22,629
I can't eat 'em all.

695
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,494
- We don't run this shit,
especially not off the front.

696
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:37,827
- I saw what i saw.

697
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:40,593
- Alma is on the phone
with police p.I.O.

698
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:42,960
And they are telling us
on the record and off

699
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,992
That they are
discounting any report of

700
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:46,658
A possible abduction.

701
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,492
- That may be.
But that doesn't mean
they're doing their job,

702
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:49,492
And it doesn't mean
we shouldn't be--

703
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:50,924
- Our job is to report
the news,

704
00:34:51,024 --> 00:34:52,324
Not to manufacture it.

705
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,556
- Nice.

706
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:05,255
- I know that they're
jealous of how much play

707
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,255
His stories get,
but the truth is...

708
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,588
- we cannot run this shit.

709
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,755
- Are you suggesting that
scott made any of this up?

710
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:19,386
- You ever notice that
the guys who do that...

711
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,452
the blairs, the glasses,
the kelleys.

712
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,419
They always start
with something small,

713
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,252
You know, just a little
quote that they clean up,

714
00:35:25,352 --> 00:35:27,284
And then, then it's
a whole anecdote,

715
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:30,485
And pretty soon they're seeing
some amazing shit.

716
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,284
They're the lucky ones
who just happen

717
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,784
To be standing on the
right street corner

718
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:37,184
In tel aviv when
the pizza joint blows up

719
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:38,684
And the human head rolls
down the street

720
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:39,716
With the eyes still blinking.

721
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:41,549
- Those pictures were
sent to him.

722
00:35:41,649 --> 00:35:42,950
The police have confirmed...

723
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,248
- it always starts
with something true,

724
00:35:46,348 --> 00:35:48,381
Something confirmed.

725
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,281
But then you've got a
son of a bitch who just

726
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,481
Happens to be walking
in the guilford entrance

727
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,447
When the mysterious
gray van comes--

728
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:58,246
- Gus, this has gotten
personal between you and scott

729
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,913
And it's affecting
your judgment.

730
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,379
I'm moving the story
through the state desk.

731
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,812
You should go home,
think this through.

732
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:08,079
We'll talk in the morning.

733
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,977
- Maybe you win a
pulitzer with this stuff.

734
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,509
And maybe you gotta
give it back.

735
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:26,275
- It's in my notes, gus.
Everything that happened.

736
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,875
Everything that guy said
when i got to him.

737
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:31,575
Every last word is
in my notes.

738
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:55,537
- Home earlier than
i thought.

739
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:58,004
- Yeah. Home.

740
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:15,001
- He hit again.
- Who did?

741
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:17,000
- Serial killer.

742
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,500
- Get a grip, motherfucker.

743
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:22,067
- You don't believe me?
Check out his left wrist.

744
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:31,665
- You fuckin' with me again,
bunk?

745
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,099
- Copycat.

746
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,530
Call mcnulty.
Get him down here.

747
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:44,996
- Ronnie.

748
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,262
- Maury.

749
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:47,962
- Been going over the
charging documents on the

750
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,729
Partlow-Stanfield drug arrests.

751
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:52,029
Problematic to say the least.

752
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:53,294
- How so?

753
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,061
- They grab the phones
and minutes later

754
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:56,961
They've cracked an
elaborate code that

755
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:58,461
Implicates everyone.

756
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:00,127
No one's that brilliant.

757
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:03,259
Not in the b.P.D.
Anyway.

758
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,992
- You don't know
lester freamon.

759
00:38:05,093 --> 00:38:07,059
- I know what i know.

760
00:38:07,193 --> 00:38:10,392
And this feels to me
like an illegal wiretap.

761
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:12,324
Your guys were up on those
phones and tracking

762
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:14,357
My clients long before
they went near any drugs.

763
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,991
- Untrue.

764
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:18,824
- We get into discovery and
i'm going to have no problem

765
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:22,590
Knocking down that bullshit
about a source of information.

766
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:25,056
And my sources around here
tell me that with all

767
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,723
The budget cutbacks,
the only wiretap

768
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:28,789
You all have
had up this year

769
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,922
Has been on
the homeless killer thing.

770
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:33,822
Whatever else you're
running is illegal.

771
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,787
- Sources?

772
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:39,987
Title threes are supposed
to be secret, maury.

773
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:41,986
Are you saying you have
a source of information

774
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,920
Inside the courthouse?

775
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,120
- It's a figure of speech.

776
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:48,351
What i'm saying is that
there's shit in the

777
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:49,652
Blood of your case.

778
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,152
And if you wait until this
goes past indictments,

779
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:54,018
I'm gonna run wild with it.

780
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,551
We should talk.

781
00:38:57,651 --> 00:38:59,018
Out of court.

782
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,850
- Oh, fuck me.

783
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:08,549
- Is it enough?
Do you have enough?

784
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,183
- It has to be.

785
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:11,382
It should be.

786
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,981
I mean, you can't look
at everything that robert

787
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,247
Found at the pattern,

788
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:16,314
And not see what this
fucking guy's about.

789
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:19,213
You know that.
I know that.

790
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:21,547
What you don't think so?

791
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,413
- I think that if you do this,

792
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,479
These son of a bitches
will do you.

793
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,646
- Come.

794
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:30,945
- Sorry. There's been another
homeless murder.

795
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:32,478
South baltimore.

796
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:37,078
- Careful, gus.

797
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,544
I can't protect you.

798
00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:47,309
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

799
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:51,109
- No fucking way.

800
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,508
- Dead for a while.

801
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:53,942
And i can assume, jimmy,

802
00:39:54,076 --> 00:39:55,874
From the fact that
the ribbon ain't red

803
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:57,274
And the simple fact
that you don't need

804
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,141
Another body because
marlo is locked up...

805
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:00,441
- i got nothing
to do with this.

806
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:01,673
- Wonderful.

807
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:03,440
We've eliminated
one suspect.

808
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,174
You see what you
started here?

809
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:06,939
- The bosses are gonna
toss it back to you,

810
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,073
No doubt.

811
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,106
- The bosses know
it's bullshit.

812
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,372
- What?

813
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:11,939
- Daniels knows.
Pearlman, too.

814
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,538
- How the fuck you...

815
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:18,705
how much longer does this...
- Can you give us a minute?

816
00:40:18,805 --> 00:40:21,904
- You turning the world
upside down with your bullshit.

817
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,171
How are you not in jail?

818
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,403
- I don't know.

819
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:26,469
The lie's so big, people
can live with it, i guess.

820
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:28,569
- Jesus fucking christ, jimmy.

821
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:29,869
I told you.

822
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,301
I fuckin' told you it was
going to come to this.

823
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:35,135
You played with fire,
didn't you?

824
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:36,735
And now we're all
getting burned...

825
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:39,467
- reporting live
from south baltimore

826
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,267
Where police have found the body
of what appears to be

827
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:43,134
Another homeless man.

828
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:45,167
This one killed and left
in a vacant lot...

829
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,766
...short while ago
have refused so far...

830
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,965
- did somebody not
get the message?

831
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:31,459
- You're not killing
them yourself, mcnulty.

832
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,792
At least assure me of that.

833
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:38,757
And the one you disappeared.

834
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,524
- He's okay, last i checked.

835
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:43,857
- Good. That's a start...

836
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:46,356
i guess.

837
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:47,990
- I thought you got
a message.

838
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,655
- Copycat.

839
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:52,221
I got nothing on this one.

840
00:41:53,422 --> 00:41:54,455
- Jesus.

841
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:55,722
- How did you do it?

842
00:41:55,855 --> 00:41:58,220
How did you get 'em by
the medical examiner?

843
00:41:58,354 --> 00:41:59,688
- Some were real and
i just linked 'em

844
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:00,954
With the ribbons.

845
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:02,987
Some i juk as
strangle jobs.

846
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:07,520
If it matters, i know now...

847
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:09,053
- fuck what you know now.

848
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:10,719
This was all for money,
mcnulty?

849
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:12,153
You couldn't live
without the o.T.?

850
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:16,085
- The stanfield case.
It was that.

851
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:19,317
- I know where it went,
but you got paid, too.

852
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:21,717
You and freamon and
maybe a dozen other guys.

853
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:23,984
- It wasn't about the money.

854
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:35,149
- Down the road,
when we settle on this--

855
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,515
And we will settle on this--

856
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:39,781
I don't expect any of you
will ever see another hour

857
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,881
Of o.T. Again.

858
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:43,380
I don't expect any of
you will be doing

859
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:45,413
Police work ever again.

860
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:46,746
And the only reason
this isn't before a

861
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:50,179
Grand jury right now
is because our mayor

862
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,445
Can't live with that.

863
00:42:51,545 --> 00:42:53,345
Oh, yeah.

864
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,912
The mayor knows your name.

865
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:57,878
- So this is your last case.

866
00:42:57,978 --> 00:42:59,377
Work it.

867
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,177
- If you're half the
detective you think you are,

868
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:03,310
You'll put this one down
fast and take us all

869
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,643
Off the hook.

870
00:43:04,743 --> 00:43:06,243
The longer this goes on,

871
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:19,775
The worse the payback's
gonna be.

872
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:26,874
The worse the payback's
gonna be.

873
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,706
- But what does he
really know?

874
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,406
- What he knows now isn't
half of what he'll learn

875
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:32,739
When we get to discovery.

876
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:34,405
They won't be able to
produce a credible source

877
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:35,738
Of information...

878
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:37,805
- they don't have to if
it's not a registered c.I.

879
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:39,438
A source of information
is only--

880
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:41,071
- If he can raise doubts
in a judge's mind,

881
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,671
We could be compelled
to reveal our source.

882
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:45,871
At that point,
we're giving up the wiretap.

883
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,070
- And he gets the paperwork
from the phone company...

884
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:50,836
- which has stanfield's
number on it.

885
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,102
- God.

886
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:56,102
- The only thing we
can do is barter.

887
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,234
- Then barter.
This can't go to court.

888
00:43:58,334 --> 00:43:59,768
- We do have some leverage.

889
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,001
- What?

890
00:44:03,668 --> 00:44:06,000
- Let's just say mr. Levy
has problems of his

891
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:08,400
Own to deal with.

892
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,332
- Make this go away...

893
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:13,799
and the mayor will not
forget that you did so.

894
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:16,464
Nor will i.

895
00:44:19,398 --> 00:44:21,898
Jimmy, ass up an'
help with this.

896
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:24,630
- Shit is funky.

897
00:44:29,596 --> 00:44:32,629
- Aw, man, we should take
this into the box.

898
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:33,696
- Where's the
pocket contents?

899
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,261
- We have questions
about the report

900
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:37,062
Of the kidnapping...

901
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:38,261
- those two bags there.

902
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:39,361
- Yes, ma'am.

903
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:43,661
Well, that would seem to
be the newspaper's problem.

904
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:47,726
I get another fucking
call about a gray van

905
00:44:47,826 --> 00:44:49,359
And i'm burning that
fucking newspaper building

906
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:51,226
To the ground.

907
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,726
- Huh.

908
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,059
- What?

909
00:44:57,325 --> 00:44:58,992
- Your homeless guy
from days ago.

910
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,125
What was in his pockets?

911
00:45:00,224 --> 00:45:01,457
- Bullshit.

912
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:03,324
- You got business cards?

913
00:45:03,457 --> 00:45:05,058
- Yeah, but every card
has an alibi.

914
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:06,423
- Let me see.

915
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:07,990
- I thought we
were done with this.

916
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:20,821
So, where you going with this?

917
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,320
- Motherfucker,
you ain't that good.

918
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:33,185
- Mcnulty,
what's up with this?

919
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:34,786
- You okay, gus?

920
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:36,085
- Hmmm?

921
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:39,451
Yeah, i'm great.

922
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:49,683
What?

923
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,882
Alma, what's up?

924
00:45:56,415 --> 00:45:57,682
- It's empty.

925
00:45:57,815 --> 00:45:58,749
- What's empty?

926
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:00,481
- The pad he waved at you,

927
00:46:00,581 --> 00:46:03,180
Saying it was all
filled with notes.

928
00:46:03,314 --> 00:46:05,814
It's empty. Every page.

929
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:08,747
- Thanks.

930
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,010
- What the fuck
is that about?

931
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:41,508
Uh-Oh.

932
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:43,907
Alma, t.V. Has police
on a sweep of the homeless

933
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:45,841
Under hanover street.

934
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:55,405
- I'll get right
to the point.

935
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:57,072
- Please do.

936
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:01,304
- Maury, hey.
- Yeah, hi.

937
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,237
- You have stanfield, right?
He's your client?

938
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:04,804
- Yeah, him and his people.

939
00:47:04,904 --> 00:47:06,771
- Well, i have some stuff,
straight from the grand jury

940
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:09,104
That you're gonna wanna
see sooner rather than later.

941
00:47:09,203 --> 00:47:10,670
- Is this a title
three case?

942
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,203
- You're gonna
find it interesting, i promise.

943
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:13,369
- All right.
When can you meet?

944
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:15,569
- Tomorrow, after work.
Same money, right?

945
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:21,301
- Yeah, the money's the same.
- Good.

946
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:24,201
- We can grand jury
gary dipasquale tomorrow,

947
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:27,001
Along with that
one-Party consent call.

948
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:30,834
Or...here's the deal.

949
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,666
No court trials.

950
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:36,566
Partlow pleads to all of
the bodies in the vacants

951
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,598
And takes life,
no parole.

952
00:47:38,698 --> 00:47:40,264
We'd want the
second shooter too,

953
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:42,032
But pearson's
beyond that now.

954
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:45,464
Metcalf and wagstaff plead
to possession with intent.

955
00:47:45,564 --> 00:47:47,797
Stanfield takes ten years
on conspiracy.

956
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,262
- You're blackmailing
an officer of the court.

957
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:55,962
The moment you came in here
and offered that quid pro quo

958
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:58,228
You were guilty of
obstruction of justice.

959
00:47:58,328 --> 00:47:59,495
- You're right.

960
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:02,894
I could get six to
eight years.

961
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:07,160
And for bribery of a state's
attorney and the violation

962
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:10,960
Of grand jury secrecy,
you could see ten to twelve.

963
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,692
I'll be out a couple
years before you, maury.

964
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,692
You come home,
first round's on me, i guess.

965
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,725
- So you'll let me walk
to keep this case out of

966
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:22,191
Open court?

967
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:25,092
That file must be dirty
as hell. Huh?

968
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:27,123
The conspiracy charge
on stanfield falls

969
00:48:27,223 --> 00:48:29,223
Without the cell phones,
and you and i both know

970
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,057
That if someone does
some digging,

971
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:32,689
They're gonna find an
illegal wiretap and

972
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:34,422
You're gonna lose
the phones.

973
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:37,155
- Everhart, two-Seventy-Four,

974
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:38,588
Maryland four-Fifty-Nine.

975
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:40,555
Or ceccolini,
four-Thirty-Five,

976
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:41,955
U.S. Two-Sixty-Eight.

977
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,153
Lying cops don't
automatically kill a case.

978
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:50,054
- But that's a lot of risk
on appeal...

979
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:52,419
and a lot of dirt for
your office to show.

980
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:55,252
No.

981
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,118
You're scared
of the light.

982
00:48:57,218 --> 00:49:01,485
Partlow takes his chances
on the legit murder charge only.

983
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,951
The conspiracy count
goes and stanfield

984
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:05,517
And the rest walk.

985
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:07,085
- Stanfield walks.

986
00:49:07,184 --> 00:49:10,116
But the case goes on
the stet docket,

987
00:49:10,216 --> 00:49:11,883
Not dismissed outright.

988
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:14,350
And although i can tell
you there are people

989
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,716
In this city who can't
tolerate a scandal at

990
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:17,749
This particular moment,
that dynamic changes

991
00:49:17,882 --> 00:49:19,115
After november.

992
00:49:19,215 --> 00:49:20,282
- The elections...

993
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,615
- after november,
no one is going to care

994
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:25,348
As much about showing dirt.

995
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:27,580
If carcetti wins,
he's in annapolis.

996
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,347
If he loses,
he's an incumbent mayor

997
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,413
Who can take a hit or two.

998
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:32,847
So you tell
mr. Stanfield that this

999
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:35,746
Is his only window.

1000
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:38,179
Partlow pleads to all
the murders

1001
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,411
And both lieutenants
plead to the drugs.

1002
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,278
Then stanfield retires.

1003
00:49:44,378 --> 00:49:45,844
He's done.

1004
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:48,544
We even get the scent of him
on the street ever again,

1005
00:49:48,644 --> 00:49:51,977
This case comes off stet
and goes to trial.

1006
00:49:52,077 --> 00:49:53,743
And if we have to put
a few cops in jail

1007
00:49:53,843 --> 00:49:55,676
Right behind him, so be it.

1008
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,141
We'll bring the evidence
and take a hit.

1009
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,308
Your client walks
away now...

1010
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:04,307
or the both of you
don't walk at all.

1011
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,971
- Let's go. Get up.

1012
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:48,567
- That's mine.

1013
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:51,233
- It's yours. I know.

1014
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:05,931
- Do you have a card?

1015
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:17,829
That's not a card.

1016
00:51:19,862 --> 00:51:22,596
- We met before,
you remember?

1017
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:24,227
- Liar.

1018
00:51:26,294 --> 00:51:28,628
Black liar.

1019
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,493
- Why'd you kill
your friend?

1020
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:36,492
- He drinks...

1021
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,693
he's always drinking.

1022
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:41,325
- But you put a
ribbon around his wrist.

1023
00:51:41,425 --> 00:51:42,592
Like the others.

1024
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,091
- Yeah.

1025
00:51:45,158 --> 00:51:46,558
- Did you see that
on television?

1026
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:49,891
The ribbon on the wrist?

1027
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:52,791
Did you hear about that
from other people?

1028
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:55,189
Why'd you do the thing
with the ribbon?

1029
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:56,590
- Nobody understands.

1030
00:51:59,057 --> 00:52:00,455
You don't understand.

1031
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:05,721
I always know what
i'm going to do...

1032
00:52:07,588 --> 00:52:10,588
before i do it. Okay?

1033
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:13,320
I always know what
i'm going to do.

1034
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,153
- Did you kill the others?
Did you kill all of them?

1035
00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:17,519
- Every one of them.

1036
00:52:21,953 --> 00:52:25,052
I did it because i knew
i was going to do it.

1037
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:33,450
I've killed millions.

1038
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:37,983
Okay?
And they all killed me.

1039
00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:40,016
- So you did all
the murders, huh?

1040
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:46,114
- You're a coward.

1041
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:49,747
I can tell.

1042
00:52:53,048 --> 00:53:00,245
Hey, do you have
a card?

1043
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:04,745
- Jimmy, reporter's in there
waiting for a photo array.

1044
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,411
- What?

1045
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:08,444
Jay, he's bullshit.

1046
00:53:08,544 --> 00:53:09,978
- I know he is.

1047
00:53:10,077 --> 00:53:11,744
But the newspaper made
such a fuss the major

1048
00:53:11,844 --> 00:53:13,944
Wants us to jerk him off,
just to say we did.

1049
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,975
- Hey, detective.

1050
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:36,540
Um...

1051
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:44,805
- no gray van either.

1052
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:45,872
- W-What...

1053
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,405
- he doesn't have a grey van.

1054
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:57,970
No gray van.

1055
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,202
And he didn't call you
on the phone either, did he?

1056
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,068
He didn't call you
the first time

1057
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:03,435
And he didn't call
you the second.

1058
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:05,302
I did that.

1059
00:54:05,402 --> 00:54:08,434
Yew mortify me
in fronta my fatha...

1060
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:10,200
and those pictures y got.

1061
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:11,734
I took those.

1062
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:14,366
And the missing guy?
He's my second cousin.

1063
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,233
We sent him up to atlantic city
with a roll of quarters.

1064
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:20,198
And you know why i can
tell you all this?

1065
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,632
Because,
you lyin' motherfucker,

1066
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:24,799
You're as full
of shit as i am,

1067
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:26,298
And you've got to live
with it and play it out

1068
00:54:26,398 --> 00:54:29,898
For as long as it goes.
Right?

1069
00:54:29,998 --> 00:54:31,630
Trapped in the same lie.

1070
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:35,864
Only difference is
i know why i did it...

1071
00:54:35,964 --> 00:54:37,263
and fuck if i can
figure out what it gets you

1072
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,062
In the end.

1073
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:41,863
But hey, i ain't part
of your tribe.

1074
00:54:41,963 --> 00:54:42,896
- You're not serious...
you can't...

1075
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:44,061
- no.

1076
00:54:45,328 --> 00:54:46,828
No, i'm a fucking joke...

1077
00:54:48,428 --> 00:54:49,894
and so are you.

1078
00:54:54,193 --> 00:54:55,960
Now get the fuck
out of here.

1079
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,120
- You walk.

1080
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,687
Chris eats the murders,
every last one,

1081
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,085
Takes life with no parole.

1082
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:40,786
- No parole?
- No shot.

1083
00:55:40,886 --> 00:55:43,020
But they've got him cold
on the one with the d.N.A.

1084
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,652
Can you sell that?
Is chris loyal?

1085
00:55:44,752 --> 00:55:46,118
- Yeah.

1086
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:49,919
As long as i take care
ofis people.

1087
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,684
- Cheese and monk are
looking at up to twenty

1088
00:55:51,784 --> 00:55:53,183
For the drugs.

1089
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:55,584
But there's gonna be no
assets investigation

1090
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:57,283
And you come home
with all your money.

1091
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:00,950
- Why they letting me walk?

1092
00:56:01,082 --> 00:56:03,448
- They don't want to,
but there's some shit

1093
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:04,715
In their case and
they'd rather not show

1094
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:06,415
It in court.

1095
00:56:06,515 --> 00:56:07,749
But here's the rub:

1096
00:56:07,882 --> 00:56:09,814
If you stay in the game,

1097
00:56:09,948 --> 00:56:12,015
They will.
They definitely will.

1098
00:56:12,114 --> 00:56:13,981
Right now, with an
election going on,

1099
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,747
They're willing to
give you a buy.

1100
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:17,780
But after november,
if they even think

1101
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,713
You're still a player,
they can take this case

1102
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:22,679
Down off the shelf and
the shit in the case

1103
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,512
Might not be enough
to keep you free.

1104
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:27,978
Do you understand?

1105
00:56:28,111 --> 00:56:29,344
- Give up the crown.

1106
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:35,610
- Well, that's the deal,
kiddo.

1107
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,243
There's not a lawyer who
could get better for you.

1108
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:53,941
- How'd that go, boss?

1109
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,740
- Kiddo, you are a goldmine
to me. You know that?

1110
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,873
You've taken this law firm
to a whole new level.

1111
00:57:01,973 --> 00:57:03,206
- Me?

1112
00:57:03,306 --> 00:57:04,805
- You don't tip me to
that bad wiretap,

1113
00:57:04,906 --> 00:57:05,972
I've got all kinds
of trouble.

1114
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:07,739
But now, if marlo
takes the deal,

1115
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,271
He's gonna get a walk
after being charged

1116
00:57:10,371 --> 00:57:12,237
In a multimillion
dollar drug seizure.

1117
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:14,371
That doesn't happen
very often,

1118
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:16,403
And when it does happen,
the name and number

1119
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:18,103
Of the defense attorney
goes in the front

1120
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:20,203
Pocket of every respectable
drug trafficker.

1121
00:57:21,537 --> 00:57:23,402
You're a genius for what
you brought me on this.

1122
00:57:23,536 --> 00:57:24,736
- I'm just doin'
what i do, right?

1123
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:27,536
You need to know something,
all you gotta do is ask.

1124
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:29,101
That's what a detective is,
right?

1125
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:30,401
- Here.

1126
00:57:30,501 --> 00:57:32,701
You should come over
for dinner tonight.

1127
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,367
Yvette's making brisket.

1128
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:35,667
- Your house?

1129
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,166
- You're mishpucha now.

1130
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:46,932
- If you say so.

1131
00:57:58,163 --> 00:57:59,463
- It's down.

1132
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,796
- Not that this thing
is ever going to trial.

1133
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:02,863
Guy has n.C.R. Written
all over him.

1134
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:04,263
- Can't argue.

1135
00:58:04,363 --> 00:58:06,228
A padded room at clifton t.
Perkins is definitely

1136
00:58:06,328 --> 00:58:07,829
Called for.

1137
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:09,295
- He go for all of them?

1138
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:10,594
- No, sir.
Just the last two.

1139
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:11,828
- He deny the others?

1140
00:58:11,928 --> 00:58:13,861
- He ain't exactly
denying anything in there.

1141
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:16,261
I mean, he'll cop to
anything we damn please...

1142
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:17,793
- then go back and get it.

1143
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,527
- Excuse me?

1144
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:22,059
If he's n.C.,
what the fuck is

1145
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:24,158
The difference if he
cops to two or six?

1146
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:26,792
Either way, they tie his
arms and feed him green jell-O.

1147
00:58:26,893 --> 00:58:28,259
- Sir, he did the last two.

1148
00:58:29,992 --> 00:58:33,658
- Motherfucker,
you are a cunt hair away

1149
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:36,090
Fromndictment and you
see fit to argue with me?

1150
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,256
- I did what i did.
I know.

1151
00:58:41,356 --> 00:58:43,422
And now, i'm standing
responsible for two fresh
murders.

1152
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:45,122
I know what
i've done here.

1153
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,655
But i'm not doing this.

1154
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:59,153
- This is over.

1155
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,052
And all of our citizens
can rest soundly

1156
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:04,086
In the knowledge that
the man responsible

1157
00:59:04,186 --> 00:59:06,519
Has been apprehended
by the diligent

1158
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,752
Efforts of investigators.

1159
00:59:07,852 --> 00:59:09,752
- Mr. Mayor,
is he being charged with

1160
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:11,718
All of the murders,
or just two...

1161
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:16,684
- um, it is my
understanding that, uh...

1162
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:20,517
- uh, we are charging
the last two incidents,

1163
00:59:20,617 --> 00:59:22,083
But it is my
understanding that

1164
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,115
He is suspected in
all of the crimes.

1165
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,082
And we're waiting for
dna test results.

1166
00:59:26,215 --> 00:59:28,549
Indications are that he
may be mentally incapacitated

1167
00:59:28,682 --> 00:59:32,348
And therefore
additional prosecutions would

1168
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:33,781
Prove redundant.

1169
00:59:33,882 --> 00:59:35,214
- I'd also like to credit
deputy commissioner for

1170
00:59:35,314 --> 00:59:38,146
Operations daniels
with not only bringing these

1171
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:39,847
Cases to their
proper conclusion,

1172
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:42,713
But but also for solving
last year's slayings

1173
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:44,713
In the vacant rowhouses.

1174
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,946
He has given us such
excellent work that

1175
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:49,578
I think that now is as good
a time as any to announce

1176
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:52,411
That we will be sending
the deputy's name forward

1177
00:59:52,512 --> 00:59:54,711
To the city council
for confirmation as

1178
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:55,978
Baltimore police commissioner.

1179
00:59:59,477 --> 01:00:00,877
Acting commissioner rawls,
to whom i am also

1180
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:03,543
Extremely grateful,
will serve in an

1181
01:00:03,676 --> 01:00:05,776
Advisory capacity pending
new responsibilities

1182
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,275
At city hall.

1183
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,139
- Scott, you should be
working the main bar

1184
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,439
On the arrest with alma.

1185
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:26,739
- I am...

1186
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,472
- we're going to want
your byline in this coverage.

1187
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,304
- Yeah, i don't feel
so wel

1188
01:00:31,404 --> 01:00:32,638
My stomach...

1189
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:36,271
i think i gotta go home.

1190
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,704
Sorry.

1191
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:26,863
- Having ducked the bullet
on that homeless mess,

1192
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:29,295
I want you to know that
the mayor and i both

1193
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:31,728
Appreciate your discretion.

1194
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:33,862
But right now we can't
take our eyes off

1195
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:36,695
The ball when it comes
to crime overall...

1196
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:39,660
looking at your weekly
u.C.R.S from the districts,

1197
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,460
I am not seeing the kind
of decline that's going

1198
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,459
To measure out to a ten
percent drop in the quarter.

1199
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:46,960
- They're clean.

1200
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:48,025
- Excuse me.

1201
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,024
- The stats are clean.

1202
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,325
They're gonna stay clean.

1203
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:55,325
Either we fix this
police department

1204
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:57,057
And the crime goes down,
or we don't

1205
01:01:57,157 --> 01:01:59,390
And the crime stays up.

1206
01:01:59,524 --> 01:02:03,122
- Commissioner, we're
talking about a little help

1207
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:04,523
In the next couple quarters.

1208
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:05,690
That's all...

1209
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:09,021
- no. I can't.

1210
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:10,388
- You're quiet on
the homeless fiasco,

1211
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:11,789
But this makes
you squeal?

1212
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:12,889
What the--

1213
01:02:12,988 --> 01:02:15,321
- Tell the mayor his
stats will be clean.

1214
01:02:15,421 --> 01:02:19,521
Before the election,
after the election...

1215
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:24,854
- you're right.
They can't fire you.

1216
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:27,886
Not without it bouncing
back on city hall.

1217
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:30,452
If you don't mind being
buried in some backroom unit,

1218
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:32,651
You can stay for as
long as you can stand it.

1219
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,818
Or until you get the pension.

1220
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:41,417
But at the same time,
i can't let you do police work.

1221
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,650
Not anything that's
going to find its way

1222
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,916
Into a courtroom.

1223
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:47,816
I won't do that.

1224
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:51,315
For both of you,
that's over.

1225
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:00,814
- So marlo walks.

1226
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:03,012
- Or you go to jail.

1227
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,580
- And you couldn't do
any better with levy, huh?

1228
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:08,613
I mean, giving up
the money...

1229
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:11,645
- i got what i could.

1230
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,811
You lost the money trail,
lester,

1231
01:03:17,945 --> 01:03:20,811
When you decided to start
coloring outside of the lines.

1232
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,476
This isn't on me.

1233
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:33,875
- What the fuck you mean
you selling?

1234
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:35,174
- I'm sellin' the connect.

1235
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:36,575
- How much, yo?

1236
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
- Ten million.

1237
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,807
- Goddamn.

1238
01:03:42,907 --> 01:03:44,607
- Or a high bidder if
i hear ten from more

1239
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:46,172
Than one of y'all.

1240
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:47,573
If you all think it
ain't worth that,

1241
01:03:47,706 --> 01:03:49,573
I stick that shit back
in my pocket and y'all

1242
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,505
Can go back to runnin'
that stepped-On new york shit.

1243
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:57,305
- You don't mind me askin',
why you sellin'?

1244
01:03:57,405 --> 01:04:00,304
I mean, even from inside
here, you can take a slice

1245
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:02,003
For just layin'
in the cut, nigga.

1246
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:03,671
- I ain't gonna be
in here long.

1247
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,870
Case they got against me
already fallin' apart.

1248
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:11,569
But the truth is,

1249
01:04:11,669 --> 01:04:14,268
I'm done with this
gangsta shit.

1250
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,234
I've been there,
done that.

1251
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:18,935
- You somethin' else
other than a gangsta?

1252
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:22,366
- Businessman.

1253
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,133
Yeah, tall man,
i can't get that shit wrapped

1254
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:25,467
Around my head neither.

1255
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:31,132
Anyway, y'all can't get
my price up,

1256
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:32,499
Maybe y'all pool your money.

1257
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:38,097
But supply only gonna deal
with y'all after

1258
01:04:38,198 --> 01:04:39,665
I make the intro.

1259
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:43,931
Then i'm out.

1260
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:45,831
- You've got a problem.

1261
01:04:47,196 --> 01:04:48,429
I thought daniels was
your boy.

1262
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:50,396
- We've both got a problem
if crime doesn't drop.

1263
01:04:50,496 --> 01:04:52,994
Carcetti loses the
statehouse and you aren't mayor.

1264
01:04:53,094 --> 01:04:56,161
And even if he wins,
nerese, you're stuck with

1265
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:58,527
A police commissioner
that won't work with you.

1266
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,427
- Oh, i'm not stuck
with anything.

1267
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:02,527
Daniels either comes
around or he's done.

1268
01:05:02,661 --> 01:05:03,761
- We just anointed him.

1269
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:05,893
We can't go back
on that now. He knows it.

1270
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:10,259
- Either he learns his place
or he'll be offering to resign.

1271
01:05:10,393 --> 01:05:12,659
Oh, you ain't the only one
knows how to play this game.

1272
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:25,423
- What to say about
this piece of work?

1273
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,622
Fuck if i don't find
myself without the right words.

1274
01:05:29,722 --> 01:05:33,322
Me, as gifted a golden throat
as any of you cocksuckers,

1275
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:34,689
Being loosed from religion,
are ever likely to hear.

1276
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:38,588
What can i say about
the dearly departed?

1277
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:40,521
I mean, really...

1278
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:42,520
- he died young. Too young.

1279
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:43,687
- Not even forty years old.

1280
01:05:43,787 --> 01:05:44,887
- Though had it lived,
his dick woulda been

1281
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:46,020
A hundred and thirty-Four...

1282
01:05:47,553 --> 01:05:48,586
- shut up.

1283
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,152
It's coming to me...

1284
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:57,318
he was the black sheep,
the permanent pariah.

1285
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:01,217
He asked no quarter of
the bosses and none was given.

1286
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:05,850
He learned no lessons,
he acknowledged no mistakes,

1287
01:06:05,982 --> 01:06:08,249
He was as stubborn a mic
as ever stumbled out of

1288
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:10,917
The northeast parishes to
take a patrolman's shield.

1289
01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:12,615
He brooked no authority.

1290
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:13,816
He did what he
wanted to do

1291
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,382
And he said what he
wanted to say

1292
01:06:16,482 --> 01:06:19,848
And in the end,
he gave you the clearances.

1293
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:24,146
He's natural police.
Yes, he was.

1294
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,480
And i don't say that
about many people.

1295
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,814
Even when they're here
on the felt,

1296
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:30,045
I don't give that one up
unless it happens to be true.

1297
01:06:31,712 --> 01:06:33,679
Natural poh-Leece.

1298
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,677
But christ,
what an asshole.

1299
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:50,543
And i'm talkin' about
the ordinary,

1300
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:53,276
Gaping orifice that
all of us possess.

1301
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:57,275
I mean an all-Encompassing,
all-Consuming,

1302
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:59,208
Out of proportion to every
other facet of his

1303
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:01,641
Humanity chasm.

1304
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:04,007
From whose borne,
if i may quote shakespeare,

1305
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,140
No traveler has ever returned.

1306
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,373
- The fuck did i do?

1307
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:10,939
- Shut the fuck up.
You're dead to us now.

1308
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,373
- Hey, hey...

1309
01:07:12,472 --> 01:07:15,405
- ho, here's his
partner in crime.

1310
01:07:18,238 --> 01:07:20,104
- Now, now. Be gentle.

1311
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:21,271
Be gentle.

1312
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,438
I'm a civilian now.
Be gentle.

1313
01:07:23,538 --> 01:07:25,069
- Your papers went in,
huh?

1314
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,069
- Yeah, this afternoon.
Thirty-Two years..

1315
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,703
- And four months.

1316
01:07:29,936 --> 01:07:31,269
- Mmm mmm.

1317
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,669
Y'all did a
fine job with him, you did.

1318
01:07:33,769 --> 01:07:35,602
He look to be about ten
years younger than i remember.

1319
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:39,967
- C'mon, there's enough room
for both of you to be laid out.

1320
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:45,000
- One at a time.

1321
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,467
You don't crowd a man
at his own wake.

1322
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:49,699
- Come on, lester?

1323
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,833
Come and snuggle.

1324
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:53,566
- Keep our secrets, jimmy.

1325
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:55,231
I got shardene with me tonight.

1326
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:58,131
- If you gentlemen
will spare us

1327
01:07:58,265 --> 01:07:59,964
This unfortunate
homoerotic lapse,

1328
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:02,297
I will conclude my
elegiac remarks...

1329
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,197
- then do it,
you gabby motherfucker...

1330
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:08,663
- to conclude...
to conclude, i say...

1331
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:11,929
he gave us thirteen
years on the line...

1332
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:13,762
not enough for a pension...

1333
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:15,529
but enough for us to
know that he was..

1334
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:17,228
- Put the fucking
song on, hue...

1335
01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:19,861
- despite his negligible
irish ancestry...

1336
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,927
his defects of
personality...

1337
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:25,593
and his inconstant
sobriety and hygiene...

1338
01:08:27,693 --> 01:08:30,860
a true murder police.

1339
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:33,225
Jimmy...

1340
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:36,125
i say this seriously.

1341
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:38,691
If i was laying there dead
on some baltimore street corner,

1342
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,425
I'd want it to be you
standing over me,

1343
01:08:40,525 --> 01:08:41,491
Catching the case.

1344
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:42,625
- Bullshit.

1345
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:48,223
- Because, brother,
when you were good,

1346
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:50,556
You were the best we had.

1347
01:08:52,856 --> 01:08:54,856
- Shit, if you was layin'
there dead on some corner,

1348
01:08:54,955 --> 01:08:56,655
It was probably jimmy
that done ya.

1349
01:08:58,655 --> 01:08:59,755
- Fuck you!

1350
01:08:59,855 --> 01:09:01,221
If you caught the case,
you'd be standing there

1351
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:02,554
Pissin' in my ear.

1352
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,174
- How did nerese campbell
get it?

1353
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,807
- You think i asked?

1354
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:30,540
Do you think it even matters?

1355
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:33,572
She gave it to me because
she thought you'd listen to me.

1356
01:10:33,672 --> 01:10:36,372
- So now they want
me to go.

1357
01:10:36,472 --> 01:10:38,706
- The way she expressed it
is that she wanted you

1358
01:10:38,806 --> 01:10:41,071
To stay if you could come
to your senses.

1359
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:42,805
- Come to my senses.

1360
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:47,570
She wants me to juke
the stats for carcetti.

1361
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,036
This quarter and the next...

1362
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:51,570
hide the crime,
get him elected as governor

1363
01:10:51,703 --> 01:10:53,436
And make her the mayor.

1364
01:10:53,536 --> 01:10:54,870
- So do it.

1365
01:10:54,969 --> 01:10:56,503
Burrell juked
them before you.

1366
01:10:56,603 --> 01:10:58,101
Warren frasier
before him.

1367
01:10:58,201 --> 01:10:59,635
And after you're gone,
rawls or whoever

1368
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,835
Will juke them. So what?

1369
01:11:01,968 --> 01:11:04,768
- I'll swallow a lie
when i have to.

1370
01:11:04,868 --> 01:11:07,234
I've swallowed a few
big ones lately.

1371
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:09,567
But the stat games...

1372
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:12,466
that lie, it's what ruined
this department.

1373
01:11:12,566 --> 01:11:15,066
Shining up shit and
calling it gold,

1374
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,665
So majors become colonels
and mayors become governors.

1375
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:20,898
Pretending to do police work
while one generation fucking

1376
01:11:20,998 --> 01:11:22,331
Trains the next how not
to do the job.

1377
01:11:22,431 --> 01:11:23,731
And that...

1378
01:11:27,731 --> 01:11:30,463
i looked carcetti
in the eye.

1379
01:11:30,563 --> 01:11:31,730
I shook his hand.

1380
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,396
I asked him if
he was for real.

1381
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:37,763
This is the lie
i can't live with.

1382
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:40,095
If i do, then nerese has me
in her pocket whenever

1383
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:41,428
She wants me.

1384
01:11:41,528 --> 01:11:44,361
And i'm no good to
anyone like that.

1385
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:46,061
- Then go.

1386
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:50,293
Withdraw for personal reasons,
or health reasons.

1387
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:51,761
Whatever.

1388
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:54,493
You've got your law degree.
You're not going to starve.

1389
01:11:56,226 --> 01:11:59,658
But if you don't go,
they'll wreck both of us.

1390
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:01,759
- There's not enough
in here to indict me.

1391
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,325
And the joke of it is,
i've seen enough

1392
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:07,391
The last few days to have
them indicted.

1393
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:09,357
- For what?

1394
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:11,623
Then use it, cedric.

1395
01:12:11,757 --> 01:12:13,056
Or at least threaten to.

1396
01:12:13,156 --> 01:12:14,656
- People will get hurt.

1397
01:12:16,022 --> 01:12:17,622
People i care about.

1398
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,756
- Then you're done.

1399
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:23,621
There's enough in that file
that you'll never make

1400
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:25,087
It through
confirmation hearings.

1401
01:12:25,187 --> 01:12:27,621
And enough so that my
career is dead before it

1402
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:28,920
Even gets started.

1403
01:12:33,053 --> 01:12:36,185
The tree that doesn't bend,
breaks, cedric.

1404
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,552
- Bend too far,
you're already broken.

1405
01:12:41,185 --> 01:12:43,451
- Marlo on a walk.

1406
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:46,184
And the money, jimmy.

1407
01:12:46,284 --> 01:12:47,784
She gave that away, too.

1408
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:50,916
- Yeah.

1409
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,050
- We don't get to
follow the money.

1410
01:12:57,182 --> 01:12:58,383
Hey...

1411
01:12:58,483 --> 01:12:59,682
wonderin' where you was...

1412
01:12:59,815 --> 01:13:01,348
- didn't know if i should
come out on this here...

1413
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:03,515
- why the fuck not?

1414
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:05,482
- Was me who told daniels.

1415
01:13:07,547 --> 01:13:10,714
I didn't want to do
it behind your back,

1416
01:13:10,814 --> 01:13:12,780
But it had to be done.

1417
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:24,344
Anyway, it was great bein'
on the job with y'all.

1418
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:28,944
I just wanted to say
that too, i guess.

1419
01:13:29,044 --> 01:13:30,943
- So what?

1420
01:13:31,043 --> 01:13:34,744
You ain't gonna drink
with me?

1421
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:37,042
- I am if you want...

1422
01:13:39,242 --> 01:13:42,808
- detective, if you think
it needed doin',

1423
01:13:42,907 --> 01:13:45,408
I guess it did.

1424
01:13:52,841 --> 01:13:54,073
- You comin'?

1425
01:14:14,403 --> 01:14:17,503
- Milton came
with six hundred.

1426
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:19,435
An' little glen is
in for three.

1427
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,335
- I got five from me

1428
01:14:21,435 --> 01:14:24,001
An' i got five from
chinaman to cover.

1429
01:14:25,568 --> 01:14:26,835
- I can go that.
No thing.

1430
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:28,101
- What?

1431
01:14:28,201 --> 01:14:30,000
Motherfucker, where you get
that kind of scratch?

1432
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:31,999
- You don't think cheese
know this here game?

1433
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,633
We sellin' dope an' coke
in baltimore, nigga,

1434
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,600
Any of y'all ain't got
that kind of money

1435
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,932
Need be ashamed.

1436
01:14:38,065 --> 01:14:41,132
- You still puttin' up more
than your share with that.

1437
01:14:41,232 --> 01:14:44,198
- The way i look at it,
we all gonna be more

1438
01:14:44,298 --> 01:14:46,565
Than paid once we own
the connect, so...

1439
01:14:46,665 --> 01:14:47,864
- shit, nigga,
we was good when

1440
01:14:47,964 --> 01:14:49,464
Your uncle had it.

1441
01:14:49,597 --> 01:14:52,230
You had to go ahead and
put up with marlo...

1442
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,863
- see that.

1443
01:14:53,963 --> 01:14:56,796
See now, that's just the
wrong way to look at it.

1444
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:00,629
'Cause joe had his time
and omar put an end to that,

1445
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,961
Then marlo had his time,
short as it was,

1446
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:05,061
An' the police put
an end to that.

1447
01:15:05,161 --> 01:15:07,661
And now, motherfucker,
it's our time.

1448
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,427
Mines and yours.

1449
01:15:10,527 --> 01:15:12,860
But instead of just
shuttin' up and kickin' in,

1450
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,360
You gonna stand there cryin'
that back-In-The-Day shit.

1451
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,560
- Cheese...

1452
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,560
- there ain't no back
in the day, nigga.

1453
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,525
Ain't no nostalgia
to this shit here.

1454
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:24,659
There's just the street
and the game

1455
01:15:24,759 --> 01:15:26,558
And what happen here today.

1456
01:15:26,691 --> 01:15:27,857
- You right.

1457
01:15:32,523 --> 01:15:35,690
- When it was my uncle,
i was with my uncle.

1458
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:38,322
When it was marlo,
i was with him.

1459
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:39,556
But now, nigga--

1460
01:15:46,221 --> 01:15:48,355
- What the fuck
did you do that for?

1461
01:15:48,455 --> 01:15:50,487
Now we short the nine.

1462
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,320
- That was for joe.

1463
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:08,351
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1464
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:21,315
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1465
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:34,313
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1466
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:47,345
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1467
01:16:47,345 --> 01:17:00,343
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1468
01:17:00,343 --> 01:17:13,374
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1469
01:17:13,374 --> 01:17:26,372
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1470
01:17:26,372 --> 01:17:36,869
- This sentimental
motherfucker just cost us money.

1471
01:17:37,003 --> 01:17:38,537
- Hey, alma...

1472
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:48,435
i just heard.

1473
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:51,134
- The carroll
county bureau?

1474
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:52,734
That's how they
punish me?

1475
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:55,233
Why not just send my ass
all the way to pennsylvania?

1476
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:56,701
- What'd they tell you?

1477
01:17:56,801 --> 01:17:59,132
- That i did an excellent job.

1478
01:17:59,232 --> 01:18:01,666
That this had nothing to do
with anything but trying

1479
01:18:01,766 --> 01:18:03,633
To make the county
bureaus stronger.

1480
01:18:05,964 --> 01:18:07,799
- Alma, i didn't tell
them about the notepad.

1481
01:18:07,898 --> 01:18:09,864
I left that part out.

1482
01:18:09,964 --> 01:18:10,997
- I told them.

1483
01:18:11,097 --> 01:18:12,431
When i heard you were
in trouble,

1484
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:14,764
I went to whiting,
told him i thought you

1485
01:18:14,863 --> 01:18:16,030
Were right about scott.

1486
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,962
I told him about the notepad.

1487
01:18:18,029 --> 01:18:19,630
Did he make all of it up?

1488
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,862
The calls from the killer?
The pictures?

1489
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:25,362
- Some, not all.

1490
01:18:25,462 --> 01:18:26,662
- Why?

1491
01:18:26,796 --> 01:18:29,061
- Look around.

1492
01:18:29,194 --> 01:18:33,461
The pond is shrinking.
The fish are nervous.

1493
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:35,660
Get some profile,
win a prize...

1494
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,060
maybe find a bigger
pond somewhere.

1495
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,825
Whiting, klebanow, templeton...

1496
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:44,159
they snatch a pulitzer or two,
and they are up

1497
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:46,625
And gone from this place.

1498
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:48,525
For them, that's what
this is all about.

1499
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:49,758
Me?

1500
01:18:49,857 --> 01:18:53,023
I'm too fuckin'
simple-Minded for that.

1501
01:18:53,157 --> 01:18:55,823
I just wanted to see
something new every day...

1502
01:18:57,557 --> 01:18:58,989
and write a
story with it.

1503
01:19:01,389 --> 01:19:04,222
Alma, you'll write
your way outta carroll

1504
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,789
In no time, watch.

1505
01:19:05,888 --> 01:19:07,021
- About as fast
as you edit

1506
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:09,155
Your way off the copy
desk, huh?

1507
01:19:26,951 --> 01:19:28,619
- Congratulations,
sergeant goette.

1508
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,950
I know you'll do well
in the eastern.

1509
01:19:35,383 --> 01:19:38,050
Glad i got to do
this at least.

1510
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,550
Congratulations,
lieutenant carver.

1511
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,050
- Thank you, sir.

1512
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,848
I'm just sorry it won't
be you i'm serving under.

1513
01:19:44,582 --> 01:19:46,049
- Word gets around, huh?

1514
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:48,581
- It's on w.B.A.L. Today.

1515
01:19:48,682 --> 01:19:51,448
They said you're leaving
for family reasons...

1516
01:19:51,581 --> 01:19:52,748
- i guess i got some kids
somewhere i don't

1517
01:19:52,847 --> 01:19:55,080
Even know about.

1518
01:19:55,213 --> 01:19:56,747
They say on b.A.L.
Who they're sending up

1519
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:57,980
As acting commissioner?

1520
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,080
- Say it ain't so.

1521
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:05,944
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1522
01:20:06,045 --> 01:20:08,045
As what may be my
last official act

1523
01:20:08,145 --> 01:20:10,412
As a baltimore
police officer,

1524
01:20:10,512 --> 01:20:13,544
Allow me to congratulate all
of the promoted officers,

1525
01:20:13,644 --> 01:20:15,910
Their families,
their fellow officers,

1526
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,077
And their friends.

1527
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:27,275
- You ain't careful,
they may make you major.

1528
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:28,975
Then you'll be truly fucked.

1529
01:20:30,174 --> 01:20:31,341
Good job.
- Thanks.

1530
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:32,874
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

1531
01:20:49,104 --> 01:20:51,204
- See now,
there you go

1532
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,837
Givin' a fuck when it
ain't your turn

1533
01:20:52,937 --> 01:20:54,004
To give a fuck.

1534
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:55,003
Lehman's squad was up.

1535
01:20:55,103 --> 01:20:56,370
- I needed the o.T.

1536
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,504
- Yeah, an' now
you got a shooting with no wits,

1537
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:01,935
No suspect and no prayer
of it goin' to black.

1538
01:21:02,036 --> 01:21:04,036
Pickin' up the phone like
a goddamn rookie.

1539
01:21:04,136 --> 01:21:05,036
Shame on you.

1540
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,068
- Stop squealin' like a bitch.

1541
01:21:07,168 --> 01:21:09,402
An' make sure you don't step
on that shell casing behind you.

1542
01:21:09,502 --> 01:21:10,801
- I ain't gonna kick no
shell casings behind me.

1543
01:21:10,901 --> 01:21:12,035
It's right there on the side.

1544
01:21:12,135 --> 01:21:13,134
I'm gonna step back and kick
no damn shell casing

1545
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:20,033
You don't mark with letters
and numbers.

1546
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:21,266
- I understand.

1547
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,133
And you gotta be in the system.

1548
01:21:23,266 --> 01:21:24,433
They sent you the form.

1549
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:26,198
- They told me that
wasn'tood enough.

1550
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,965
They said they wanted
the other paper work.

1551
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:30,032
- And you said you applied
for s.S.I., mr. Belton?

1552
01:21:30,132 --> 01:21:31,364
- Yes, ma'am.

1553
01:21:31,464 --> 01:21:32,464
- Well, let's go
inside and look it up on

1554
01:21:32,564 --> 01:21:33,698
The computer.

1555
01:21:33,797 --> 01:21:35,930
- Hey, you remember me?

1556
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:38,530
I brought this guy in
a few weeks back,

1557
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:40,130
I just wanted to see
how he was...

1558
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:44,629
- he wandered out after
a couple nights.

1559
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:45,928
Sorry.

1560
01:21:46,995 --> 01:21:48,329
- Where...

1561
01:21:49,728 --> 01:21:51,128
where do the homeless
go around here?

1562
01:21:51,228 --> 01:21:52,395
- Different places.

1563
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:53,994
Down by the river,
over in the

1564
01:21:54,094 --> 01:21:55,594
Warehouse district...

1565
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,494
some of the places,
i don't really think

1566
01:21:58,594 --> 01:21:59,661
It would be safe
for you to go...

1567
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:02,126
- i'm police.
Well, i used to be.

1568
01:22:02,226 --> 01:22:03,326
- Wait here.

1569
01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:04,726
I'll see if i
can find you a map.

1570
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:07,092
- Thanks.
- Come on, mr. Belton.

1571
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:12,725
- And if the major could find
his ass with his hand,

1572
01:22:12,824 --> 01:22:14,024
He'd know that this we have
more than enough for us

1573
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:15,724
To be up on a pen register.

1574
01:22:15,823 --> 01:22:18,457
Lieutenant carver told him so,
but fuck if he isn't trying

1575
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:19,723
To shut this thing down.

1576
01:22:24,623 --> 01:22:26,489
All's i'm sayin' is a
phone call or two and

1577
01:22:26,589 --> 01:22:28,522
You're gonna find out
that they're gettin'

1578
01:22:28,622 --> 01:22:30,689
Some kinda pressure from
somewhere to sit on this thing,

1579
01:22:30,788 --> 01:22:33,154
Even though we've tied
three killings to this crew.

1580
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,321
- Does the police
commissioner know?

1581
01:22:37,421 --> 01:22:38,919
- Him?

1582
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,520
He wouldn't know police
work if it took down his

1583
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,120
Front door on a warrant.

1584
01:22:46,286 --> 01:22:48,152
Just...

1585
01:22:48,252 --> 01:22:50,184
keep my name out of it.

1586
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,351
- New westport is like
howard street ten years ago,

1587
01:22:55,451 --> 01:22:58,183
Except the land's cheaper
and there's more potential

1588
01:22:58,284 --> 01:23:00,350
For mixed-Use because of
the waterfront location.

1589
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,717
- There you are.

1590
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:03,616
- You can't put a price
on a waterview.

1591
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,949
- Oh, yes, you can.

1592
01:23:05,049 --> 01:23:07,016
You definitely can.

1593
01:23:08,715 --> 01:23:10,848
- Andy, he's gotta meet
tommy and they're leaving early,

1594
01:23:10,981 --> 01:23:12,248
So let me borrow him
for a moment.

1595
01:23:12,348 --> 01:23:13,482
- Sure, no problem.

1596
01:23:13,582 --> 01:23:15,080
Nice to meet you,
mr. Stanfield.

1597
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:20,347
- You know who you
were talking to?

1598
01:23:20,447 --> 01:23:23,513
- Nah.
- Andy krawczyk.

1599
01:23:23,613 --> 01:23:25,013
Very connected.

1600
01:23:25,113 --> 01:23:26,513
Very big with development
around the harbor.

1601
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:29,512
He's someone you're
gonna wanna know well,

1602
01:23:29,646 --> 01:23:31,479
But kid, do not...

1603
01:23:33,711 --> 01:23:35,977
do not get in a room
with him alone.

1604
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,645
You want me in there with you,
believe me.

1605
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:39,343
Otherwise, guys like that
will bleed you...

1606
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,577
i want you to meet tommy
flanagan before he leaves...

1607
01:23:41,677 --> 01:23:44,510
- yeah, gimme a minute.
I need to, um...

1608
01:23:44,644 --> 01:23:46,042
- bathroom?
- Yeah.

1609
01:23:46,142 --> 01:23:47,376
- Down the hall to the right.

1610
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,074
Hey, watch that stuff.
You'll put on weight.

1611
01:24:12,904 --> 01:24:14,838
- But next time,
i want you to make sure

1612
01:24:14,938 --> 01:24:17,371
That you watch this money...

1613
01:24:19,404 --> 01:24:21,936
- uh-Uh. Don't...
umm-Uh. Don't do it.

1614
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:30,768
Time to give that up.

1615
01:24:31,935 --> 01:24:33,402
- Do you know who i am?

1616
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:35,001
- Name's vinson.

1617
01:24:35,101 --> 01:24:38,034
Used to be marlo's bank,
but marlo ain't 'round no more,

1618
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:43,233
And you still movin' money
for other players so...

1619
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:44,933
i'm thinkin' some of that
money need to be mine.

1620
01:24:45,066 --> 01:24:46,965
- Shit...

1621
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:49,099
you just a boy.

1622
01:24:51,865 --> 01:24:53,665
That's just your knee.

1623
01:24:53,764 --> 01:24:55,864
- That motherfucker shot me.

1624
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:04,063
- Nice doin' business,
gentlemen.

1625
01:25:10,428 --> 01:25:12,228
- No way, that's bullshit.

1626
01:25:12,328 --> 01:25:14,695
I heard it different.
The real story about omar

1627
01:25:14,794 --> 01:25:15,995
Is that a bunch of cops
made it look like them

1628
01:25:16,095 --> 01:25:17,461
New york boys killed him.

1629
01:25:17,594 --> 01:25:18,694
But it was them.

1630
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:20,227
They're the ones that
really killed him.

1631
01:25:20,327 --> 01:25:21,461
- Listen, motherfucker,

1632
01:25:21,561 --> 01:25:22,859
I know what happened to him.

1633
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:24,460
Them police had nothing
to do with it.

1634
01:25:24,593 --> 01:25:26,159
No new york boys neither.

1635
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,393
So omar's got an a.K.,
right?

1636
01:25:28,492 --> 01:25:29,958
But he's surrounded.

1637
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:32,359
It's like eight,
nine motherfuckers up there

1638
01:25:32,492 --> 01:25:33,492
And they all got nines.

1639
01:25:33,592 --> 01:25:34,658
But he like,
"you all think you..."

1640
01:25:34,757 --> 01:25:36,057
- Fuck you lookin' at?

1641
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:39,124
- You, nigga.

1642
01:25:39,224 --> 01:25:40,391
- You know who i am?

1643
01:25:40,491 --> 01:25:41,756
- Nigga, you know
who i am?

1644
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,557
- Oh, shit!

1645
01:26:11,318 --> 01:26:12,552
- Yeah...

1646
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:45,136
- on me, all right?

1647
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:12,931
- Thank you. Thank you.

1648
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:16,731
Thank you.

1649
01:28:16,831 --> 01:28:19,564
This is a great day for
democrats and it's a

1650
01:28:19,698 --> 01:28:21,331
Great day for maryland.

1651
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:25,096
- Hey, zorzi.

1652
01:28:25,196 --> 01:28:26,597
I hope i get this by e-Dot.

1653
01:28:26,697 --> 01:28:28,663
- Okay, three minutes,
for christ's sake.

1654
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,196
Don't get your
panties in a knot.

1655
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,960
- Commissioner valchek.

1656
01:29:07,123 --> 01:29:08,289
- Madam prosecutor,

1657
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:09,489
Gentlemen...

1658
01:29:11,156 --> 01:29:13,590
first case up and
i have to recuse myself.

1659
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:16,622
- Your honor,
i appreciate your concern.

1660
01:29:34,918 --> 01:29:36,686
- Congratulations,
superintendent.

1661
01:29:36,785 --> 01:29:38,018
Welcome aboard.

1662
01:29:38,117 --> 01:29:39,984
- Thank you, governor.
Happy to be aboard.

1663
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:41,418
- Thank you.

1664
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,536
Larry...

1665
01:31:24,634 --> 01:31:26,434
let's go home.
