00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:43,871
<i>The little lord's</i>
<i>been dreaming again.</i>

4
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:53,480
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

5
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:56,517
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

6
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,620
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

7
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:03,224
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

8
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:06,260
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

9
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:08,196
But Robb's
Lord of Winterfell,

10
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,366
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

11
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:15,103
Hodor!

12
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,142
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,278
<i>Hodor.</i>

14
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:32,922
I must say I received a slightly
warmer welcome on my last visit.

15
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:35,458
Any man of The Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

16
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,695
Any man of The Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

17
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,664
I'm not your boy,
Lannister.

18
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,667
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

19
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:46,204
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

20
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,142
So it's true.

21
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,245
Hello, Bran.

22
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,614
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

23
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:59,250
He has no memory
of that day.

24
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:01,718
- Curious.
- Why are you here

25
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:05,921
would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

26
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:09,691
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

27
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:14,930
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

28
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,366
Well, I mean
I <i>did</i> like to.

29
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,636
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

30
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,938
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

31
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,009
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

32
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,078
My father will
rejoice to hear it.

33
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:29,714
I have a gift
for you.

34
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,284
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

35
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:36,888
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

36
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:38,990
<i>Start with a yearling</i>
<i>and teach it to respond</i>

37
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,958
<i>to the reins</i>
<i>and to the boy's voice.</i>

38
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:43,894
Will I really be
able to ride?

39
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,496
You will.

40
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,864
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

41
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:51,167
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

42
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,902
I have a tender spot
in my heart

43
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:55,839
for cripples, bastards
and broken things.

44
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:58,976
<i>You've done my brother</i>
<i>a kindness.</i>

45
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:01,313
The hospitality
of Winterfell is yours.

46
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:04,182
Spare me your false courtesies,
Lord Stark.

47
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,418
There's a brothel
outside your walls.

48
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,354
There I'll find a bed and both
of us can sleep easier.

49
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,029
Couldn't resist
some Northern ass?

50
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:19,832
If you like redheads,
ask for Ros.

51
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,735
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

52
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,304
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

53
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:28,274
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

54
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:30,276
What happened here?

55
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,678
Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

56
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:35,581
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

57
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,816
- Where did she go?
- My Lady's whereabouts--

58
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,518
My Lady?

59
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,956
Your loyalty to your captors
is touching.

60
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,192
Tell me, how do you think
balon Greyjoy would feel

61
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,161
if he could see his only
surviving son has turned lackey?

62
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,531
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet

63
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:54,166
burn in Lannisport.

64
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,102
I believe your uncles
were responsible?

65
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,404
Must have been a pretty sight.

66
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:59,846
Nothing prettier than watching
sailors burn alive.

67
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:03,343
Yes, a great victory
for your people.

68
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:07,081
- Shame how it all turned out.
- We were outnumbered 10 to one--

69
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,150
a stupid rebellion then.

70
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:11,186
I suppose your father
realized that

71
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,722
when your brothers
died in battle.

72
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:17,126
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

73
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,994
- Careful, imp.
- I've offended you.

74
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:22,331
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

75
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:25,767
Anyway, don't despair.

76
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,237
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

77
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,005
and I've learned
to live with it.

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,908
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

79
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:36,211
I'll try not
to wear her out.

80
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,485
<i>Shoulder, legs.</i>

81
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:51,459
<i>Leg, shoulder, leg.</i>

82
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,395
<i>Left foot forward.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

83
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:56,831
Now pivot as you
deliver the stroke.

84
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,533
Put all your weight
behind it.

85
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,901
What in seven hells
is that?

86
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:03,471
<i>They'll need an eighth hell</i>
<i>to fit him in.</i>

87
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,675
Tell them
your name.

88
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,910
Samwell Tarly,

89
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:12,246
of Horn Hill--
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

90
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,218
- I've come to take the black.
- Come to take the black pudding.

91
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,834
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

92
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,056
Rast...

93
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,292
<i>See what he can do.</i>

94
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,201
I yield.

95
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:38,171
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

96
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:40,239
Pick up your sword.

97
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,875
Hit him till he
finds his feet.

98
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,654
It seems they've run short of
poachers and thieves down South.

99
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,557
- <i>Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.</i>
- Jon!

100
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:00,160
<i>Again, harder.</i>

101
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:02,062
I yield!

102
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,597
Enough!

103
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:06,900
<i>He yielded.</i>

104
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:10,537
Looks like
the bastard's in love.

105
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,241
All right then,
Lord Snow,

106
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:18,511
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

107
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,648
You two. Three of you ought
to be sufficient

108
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:23,983
to make
lady piggy squeal.

109
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:27,086
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

110
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,690
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

111
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:48,408
Yield yield yield!
I yield.

112
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,179
We're done
for today.

113
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:53,947
Go clean the armory.

114
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:55,748
That's all
you're good for.

115
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:02,388
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

116
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,926
Did he hurt you?

117
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,161
I've had worse.

118
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,999
You can call me Sam...
If you want.

119
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,736
- My mother calls me Sam--
- it's not going to get any easier, you know?

120
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:20,006
You're going to have
to defend yourself.

121
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,941
Why didn't you get up
and fight?

122
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,278
I wanted to.

123
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,681
- <i>I just couldn't.</i>
- Why not?

124
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,552
I'm a coward.

125
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:36,156
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

126
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,258
You're right.
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,427
I just... wanted
to thank you.

128
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,140
A bloody coward.

129
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,242
People saw us
talking to him.

130
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,411
Now they'll think
we're cowards too.

131
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,145
You're too stupid
to be a coward.

132
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,481
- You're too stupid to be a--
- Quick now,

133
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:05,184
before summer's over.

134
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,419
C'mere!

135
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,150
Hyah hyah!

136
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:45,624
Vaes Dothrak--
the city of the horselords.

137
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,395
A pile of mud.

138
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,897
Mud and shit
and twigs--

139
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:54,200
- best these savages can do.
- These are <i>my</i> people now.

140
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:56,302
You shouldn't
call them savages.

141
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:58,437
I'll call them what I like,
because they're <i>my</i> people.

142
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,806
This is my army.

143
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,242
Khal Drogo is marching the
wrong way with my army.

144
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:26,797
If my brother <i>was</i> given
an army of Dothraki,

145
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:30,567
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

146
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:33,303
The Dothraki have never
crossed the Narrow Sea.

147
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,973
<i>They fear any water</i>
<i>their horses can't drink.</i>

148
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:38,342
But if they did?

149
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,879
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

150
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:44,848
<i>but the men</i>
<i>advising him are different.</i>

151
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:49,085
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

152
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,254
<i>long ago.</i>

153
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:53,656
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

154
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,459
He drove me
from my land.

155
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:59,796
You sold slaves.

156
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:03,399
Aye.

157
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:07,270
- Why?
- I had no money

158
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:09,806
and an expensive wife.

159
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,675
And where is she now?

160
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,643
In another place,

161
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:16,113
with another man.

162
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:24,521
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

163
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:27,324
They call you
the Last Dragon...

164
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:30,060
They do.

165
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,498
You have dragon's blood

166
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,433
in your veins?

167
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,502
It's entirely possible.

168
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:41,106
What happened to the dragons?

169
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,809
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

170
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:50,182
The brave men
didn't kill dragons.

171
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:52,985
The brave men
rode them.

172
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,423
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

173
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,993
this world
has ever seen.

174
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,362
The breath
of the greatest dragon

175
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:04,398
forged the Iron Throne,

176
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:07,201
which the usurper is
keeping warm for me.

177
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:11,038
The swords
of the vanquished,

178
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,873
a thousand of them...

179
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:18,278
Melted together
like so many candles.

180
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,683
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

181
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,220
There is nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

182
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:31,422
Really.
Why dragons?

183
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:34,158
They can fly.

184
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:37,296
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

185
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,932
and they're
somewhere else...

186
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,101
Far away.

187
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:46,907
And they can kill.

188
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:51,512
Anyone or anything that
tries to hurt them

189
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:56,550
gets burned away to nothing...

190
00:13:56,584 --> 00:14:00,153
...Like so many candles.

191
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:01,354
Ow.

192
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,292
Yes.
Seeing a dragon

193
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,260
would make me very happy.

194
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,863
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

195
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,098
I imagine just seeing
the sky makes you happy.

196
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:16,201
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

197
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:18,204
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

198
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:22,008
A man from Asshai with a dagger
of real dragonglass.

199
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:24,178
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

200
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:28,617
change his face the way that
other men change their clothes.

201
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:32,655
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

202
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:36,825
and whose ship had
sails of colored silk.

203
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:41,297
So...

204
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,499
Have you seen one?

205
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:47,036
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

206
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,038
No.

207
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:53,543
No, the last one died many years
before I was born.

208
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:56,912
I'll tell you
what I have seen:

209
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:59,515
Their skulls.

210
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,686
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

211
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,122
When I was very young,
just three or four,

212
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,358
my father used
to walk me down the rows

213
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,126
and I'd recite
their names for him.

214
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:11,997
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

215
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,801
The ones closest to the door were
the last ones they were able to hatch

216
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,636
and they were all
stunted and wrong.

217
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,940
Skulls no bigger
than dog skulls.

218
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:26,912
But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

219
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:30,282
They got bigger

220
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:33,385
and bigger and bigger.

221
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:38,690
There was Ghiscar

222
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:41,293
and Valryon,

223
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,094
Vermithrax,

224
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,463
Essovius--

225
00:15:45,498 --> 00:15:47,999
Archonei,

226
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:51,002
Meraxes,

227
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:54,505
Vhagar...

228
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,911
And Balerion the dread...

229
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,513
...Whose fire forged

230
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,650
the Seven Kingdoms

231
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,919
into one.

232
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:13,127
What happened
to the skulls?

233
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,998
I don't know.

234
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:20,334
The usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

235
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:23,438
Scattered to the wind.

236
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:29,176
That's very sad.

237
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,045
Yes, it is.

238
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,848
What did I buy you for?

239
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:37,951
- To make me sad?
- No, your Grace.

240
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:42,388
To, uh, teach your sister.

241
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:44,823
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

242
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:48,760
You think I bought you to make
<i>Khal Drogo</i> happy?

243
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,202
Oh, you pretty
little idiot.

244
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,373
Go on then.
Get on with it.

245
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,885
Someday your husband
will sit there

246
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,187
and you will sit
by his side.

247
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:20,360
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

248
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,962
All the Lords of Westeros

249
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,732
will gather here to see
the little prince--

250
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,567
what if I have a girl?

251
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:30,537
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

252
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:33,172
What if I <i>only</i>
have girls?

253
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,342
I wouldn't worry
about that.

254
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:38,444
Jeyne Poole's mother had five children--
all of them girls.

255
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,580
Yes, but it's
highly unlikely.

256
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:43,116
But what if?

257
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,352
Well, if you only
had girls,

258
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:49,956
I suppose the throne would
pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

259
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,926
And everyone
would hate me.

260
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,061
Nobody could ever
hate you.

261
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:57,598
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

262
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:00,667
Why would you say
such a thing?

263
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,271
That business with the wolves?
Sansa,

264
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:06,707
I've told you
a hundred times:

265
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:09,476
- A direwolf is not--
- please shut up about it.

266
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,679
Do you remember
your lessons?

267
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:17,251
Who built the Iron Throne?

268
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:19,353
Aegon the Conqueror.

269
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,422
And who built
the Red Keep?

270
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,023
Maegor the Cruel.

271
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:24,925
And how many years
did it take to build--

272
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,995
my grandfather and Uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

273
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:32,732
They were killed on the orders of
King Aerys, yes.

274
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:37,070
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

275
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:39,538
Why were they killed?

276
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,808
You should be speak to your
father about these matters.

277
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:45,843
I don't want to speak
to my father-- ever.

278
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:49,347
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

279
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:50,882
to forgive your father.

280
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,683
No, I won't.

281
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:54,985
It's The Hand's
tournament that's causing

282
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,688
- all this trouble, My Lords.
- The <i>King's</i> tournament.

283
00:18:57,723 --> 00:19:01,358
I assure you The Hand
wants no part of it.

284
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:03,627
Call it what you will,
Lord Stark, Ser,

285
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:06,930
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

286
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:10,133
Last night we had a tavern riot,
a brothel fire,

287
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:13,070
<i>three stabbings and a drunken horse race</i>
<i>down the Street of Sisters.</i>

288
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:15,939
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the King's peace,

289
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:19,009
perhaps the city watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

290
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,744
- I need more men.
- Ned: <i>You'll get 50.</i>

291
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,714
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

292
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,449
You found money
for a champion's purse,

293
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,384
<i>you can find money</i>
<i>to keep the peace.</i>

294
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:31,255
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

295
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:33,089
<i>till the crowds</i>
<i>have left.</i>

296
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:34,758
Thank you,
My Lord Hand, Ser.

297
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,526
They will be put
to good use.

298
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,797
The sooner this is over,
the better.

299
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,800
The realm prospers
from such events, My Lord.

300
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,002
They give the great
a chance at glory,

301
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,304
and the lowly a respite
from their woes.

302
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,774
<i>And every inn in</i>
<i>the city is full</i>

303
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:52,842
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

304
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:55,345
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

305
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,914
- Hmmm.
- Now...

306
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,517
If there's nothing else,
My Lords?

307
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:12,562
Oh, this heat.

308
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:15,398
On days like this,
I envy you Northerners

309
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,167
your summer snows.

310
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,215
Until tomorrow, My Lord--

311
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,612
I've been hoping to talk
to you about Jon Arryn.

312
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,673
Lord Arryn?

313
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:25,875
Oh, his death was

314
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,644
a great sadness
to all of us.

315
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,913
I took personal charge
of his care,

316
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:33,616
but I could not
save him.

317
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,919
His sickness struck him

318
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:39,389
very hard and very fast.

319
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,959
I saw him in my chambers

320
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:43,928
just the night
before he passed.

321
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:47,131
Lord Jon often came
to me for counsel.

322
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,902
Why?

323
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:53,505
I have been Grand Maester
for many years.

324
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,975
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since--

325
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,912
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

326
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:02,381
Oh, he came inquiring
after a book.

327
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:04,150
A book?

328
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:05,818
What book?

329
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:07,553
Oh, I fear

330
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:10,357
it would be of little interest
to you, My Lord.

331
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:12,859
A ponderous Tome.

332
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:16,463
No, I'd like to read it.

333
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,469
"The Lineages and Histories

334
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:24,673
of the Great H
of the Seven Kingdoms,

335
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:28,377
with descriptions
of many high lords

336
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:31,514
and noble ladies

337
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:33,682
and their children."

338
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:53,266
"Harkon Umber,
first of his name,

339
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,103
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

340
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:59,672
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

341
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:03,010
at the last hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

342
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:06,547
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

343
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:08,817
of a wound sustained
in a bear hunt."

344
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:12,621
As I said, My Lord,
a ponderous read.

345
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:15,490
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

346
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:18,293
He did not, My Lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

347
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:20,961
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

348
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:23,330
...Did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

349
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,165
Nothing of import,
My Lord.

350
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,001
Oh-- there was one phrase

351
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:29,869
he kept repeating:

352
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:33,372
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

353
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,709
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mm.

354
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:37,978
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

355
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:41,115
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

356
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,651
For all the weight
they're given,

357
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:45,754
last words are usually

358
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:47,857
as significant
as first words.

359
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:50,826
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

360
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:53,162
What else could it be?

361
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,698
Poison.

362
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:58,401
A disturbing thought.

363
00:22:58,435 --> 00:23:00,603
No no no, I don't
think it likely.

364
00:23:00,637 --> 00:23:03,038
The Hand
was loved by all.

365
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:05,074
What sort of man
would dare--

366
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,977
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

367
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,479
Yes, women,

368
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,414
cravens...

369
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:15,116
And eunuchs.

370
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:18,554
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

371
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:20,055
Everybody knows that.

372
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:22,324
Yes yes, of course.

373
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:25,794
How that sort of <i>person</i>
found himself

374
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:28,463
on the King's Council,
I will never know.

375
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:30,198
I've taken enough
of your time.

376
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:32,835
No trouble at all, My Lord.
It's a great honor--

377
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,603
thank you.

378
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:36,572
I'll find my own way out.

379
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:01,133
Syrio says a water dancer

380
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,867
can stand on one toe
for hours.

381
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:05,704
It's a hard fall
down these steps.

382
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,706
Syrio says every hurt
is a lesson

383
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:09,942
and every lesson
makes you better.

384
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:14,480
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats?

385
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:16,015
Syrio says.

386
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:18,117
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

387
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:21,188
They're quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

388
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:23,490
You have to be
quick to catch them.

389
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:25,360
He's right about that.

390
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,828
Now that Bran's awake

391
00:24:26,862 --> 00:24:29,665
will he come
live with us?

392
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:34,637
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

393
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,139
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

394
00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:41,544
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

395
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,514
But someday

396
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,850
he could be
Lord of a Holdfast

397
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:50,118
or sit on
the King's Council.

398
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:52,555
Or he might raise castles

399
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:55,123
like Brandon the builder.

400
00:24:55,158 --> 00:24:57,893
Can I be Lord
of a Holdfast?

401
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:05,266
You will marry
a high lord

402
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,301
and rule his castle.

403
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,702
And your sons
shall be knights

404
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:12,338
and princes and lords.

405
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:16,409
Hmm?
No.

406
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,812
That's not me.

407
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:44,071
Hello.

408
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:48,175
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new Watch partner.

409
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:51,879
I should warn you,

410
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:54,782
I don't see
all that well.

411
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,952
Come stand by the fire.

412
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:01,556
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

413
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,958
You're not.
You're freezing.

414
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:18,740
I don't like
high places.

415
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:20,509
You can't fight.

416
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:22,311
You can't see.

417
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:25,682
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

418
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,319
What are you
doing here, Sam?

419
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,394
On the morning of my 18th Nameday,
my father came to me.

420
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,998
"You're almost
a man now," he said...

421
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,569
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

422
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,140
Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

423
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,476
forsake all claim to your
inheritance and start North.

424
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,914
If you do not,"
he said...

425
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,083
"Then we'll have a hunt

426
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,153
and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

427
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:06,023
and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

428
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,061
Or so I'll tell
your mother.

429
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,263
Nothing would
please me more."

430
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,538
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

431
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,842
Yes, he is.

432
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,645
I'm not going to get
any better, you know?

433
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,982
Well...

434
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,817
You can't get any worse.

435
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:45,394
I hear you're reading
a boring book.

436
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:47,229
Hmph.

437
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:49,398
Pycelle talks too much.

438
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:51,333
Oh, he never stops.

439
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,868
Do you know Ser Hugh
of the Vale?

440
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:57,405
Not surprising.
Until recently,

441
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,975
he was only a squire--
Jon Arryn's squire.

442
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,977
He was knighted
almost immediately

443
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:05,413
after his master's
untimely death.

444
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:07,749
Knighted for what?

445
00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:10,351
Why are you
telling me this?

446
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,086
I promised cat
that I'd help you.

447
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,588
Where is Ser Hugh?

448
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:17,524
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

449
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,726
Do you see
that boy there?

450
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:22,395
One of Varys's little birds.

451
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,232
The spider has taken a great
interest in your comings and goings.

452
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:28,167
Now look there.

453
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:30,936
That one belongs
to the Queen.

454
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:34,106
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

455
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,008
Varys or the Queen?

456
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:39,744
No, she's one
of mine.

457
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:44,681
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

458
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,186
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, My Lord.

459
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:54,224
Get a message to
this paragon of yours--

460
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:57,427
discreetly--
send him to question Ser Hugh.

461
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:01,699
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.

462
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:05,336
He lives in a large house at the top
of the Street of Steel.

463
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,772
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

464
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:10,308
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

465
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:14,246
visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.

466
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:18,883
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
wrong to distrust you.

467
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:20,785
Distrusting me was
the wisest thing

468
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,421
you've done since you climbed
off your horse.

469
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:33,029
...Two, three,

470
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,864
24, five,

471
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,200
six, 27,

472
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,235
- 28, 29--
- Ser Hugh?

473
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,938
30, 31, 32

474
00:29:40,972 --> 00:29:43,240
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

475
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:46,210
I'm here on behalf
of Lord Eddard Stark,

476
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,513
the Hand of the King.

477
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:49,947
I'm the Captain
of his guard.

478
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:52,150
I'm sorry, I didn't catch
your name, Ser...

479
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:54,853
No "Ser."
I'm not a knight.

480
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:58,189
I see. Well, it just
so happens that I am.

481
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,896
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the hand himself.

482
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,764
He's a <i>knight,</i>
you see.

483
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:09,532
Ah, a knight.

484
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:12,434
They strut around
like roosters down here.

485
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:16,138
<i>Even the ones who've never seen</i>
<i>an arrow coming their way.</i>

486
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:18,040
You shouldn't be
out here, My Lord.

487
00:30:18,074 --> 00:30:21,510
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

488
00:30:23,513 --> 00:30:26,348
The former Hand did call on me,
My Lord, several times.

489
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:29,718
I regret to say he did not honor me
with his patronage.

490
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:32,287
What did
Lord Arryn want?

491
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:34,389
He always came to see the boy.

492
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:36,325
I'd like to see him
as well.

493
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,695
As you Gendry! My lord.

494
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:46,066
Here he is.

495
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,735
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

496
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,905
Show the hand
the helmet you made, lad.

497
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:08,523
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

498
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:10,458
Boy, this is
the King's Hand!

499
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,896
- If his lordship wants the helm--
- I made it for me.

500
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,565
- Forgive him, My Lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

501
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:20,802
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

502
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:23,338
He just asked me questions
is all, My Lord.

503
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:25,540
What kind
of questions?

504
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:29,944
About my work at first,

505
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:33,581
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

506
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:37,552
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

507
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,989
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

508
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:44,759
What did you tell him?

509
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:48,530
She died when I was little.

510
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:50,798
She had yellow hair.

511
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,468
She'd sing to me sometimes.

512
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,241
Look at me.

513
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:10,887
Get back to work, lad.

514
00:32:12,623 --> 00:32:14,624
If the day ever comes
when that boy

515
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:16,826
would rather wield
a sword than forge one,

516
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,261
<i>you send him to me.</i>

517
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:26,068
Find anything?

518
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:29,905
King Robert's
bastard son.

519
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:34,977
<i>He likes that.</i>

520
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,316
This is for the King
from Lord Stark.

521
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,585
Should I leave it with--

522
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,354
shhh.

523
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:45,223
Listen.

524
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,993
Do you hear them?

525
00:32:50,297 --> 00:32:52,531
How many do you think
are in there with him?

526
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:54,366
Huh?

527
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,201
- <i>Guess.</i>
- Three?

528
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,536
Four.

529
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:02,507
He likes to do this
when I'm on duty--

530
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:05,109
he makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

531
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:11,639
Forgive me, My Lord--

532
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,665
Why do I have to forgive you?
Have you wronged me?

533
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:17,988
We've met before, you know.

534
00:33:18,023 --> 00:33:20,992
Have we?
Strange, I've forgotten.

535
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:24,463
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

536
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:26,298
Ah.

537
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:28,367
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

538
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:29,802
Oh.

539
00:33:29,837 --> 00:33:31,671
One of the Greyjoys
nearly took my eye.

540
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:34,675
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

541
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,877
<i>They stopped liking it</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

542
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:40,914
That was a proper battle.
Do you remember

543
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:43,984
Thoros of Myr charging
through the breach?

544
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:45,552
With his burning sword?

545
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:47,455
I'll remember that
till the day I die.

546
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:51,326
I saw the youngest of the
Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

547
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,728
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

548
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:56,030
Theon?
He's a good lad.

549
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:57,165
I doubt it.

550
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:04,540
<i>I'll bet you smell</i>
<i>of blackberry jam!</i>

551
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,943
<i>Let me smell it.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>

552
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,480
Can I leave this
with you?

553
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,149
The message
from Lord Stark.

554
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,518
I don't serve Lord Stark.

555
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:40,075
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

556
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:42,477
- With Sam.
- Ah, prince porkchop.

557
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:44,646
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

558
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:46,348
Impossible!

559
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:48,918
That's enough.

560
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,526
Sam's no different
from the rest of us.

561
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,862
There was no place
for him in the world,

562
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,696
so he's come here.

563
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,166
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

564
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,068
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

565
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:09,071
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

566
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,773
You <i>are</i> in love, Lord Snow.

567
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:17,212
You girls can do
as you please.

568
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:20,082
But if Thorne puts me
up against lady piggy,

569
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,184
I'm gonna slice me off
a side of bacon.

570
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,946
No one touches Sam.

571
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:04,563
What are you
waiting for?

572
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,875
Attack him!

573
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:28,086
You get in there.

574
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:33,558
Hit me.

575
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,762
Go on, hit me!

576
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,300
<i>I yield!</i>

577
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,302
Yield yield.

578
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,570
<i>I yield.</i>

579
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,443
You think this
is funny, do you?

580
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,048
When you're out there

581
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,784
beyond The Wall
with the sun going down,

582
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:02,254
do you want
a man at your back?

583
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:04,590
Or a sniveling boy?

584
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,807
You send this whore
to give me commands?

585
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:24,376
I should have sent
you back her head!

586
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,311
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

587
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:27,946
Hush now.
It's all right.

588
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:31,283
- Irri, take her and leave us.
- <i>Yes, Khaleesi.</i>

589
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:37,689
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

590
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:39,324
You do not command me.

591
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,125
I wasn't commanding you.

592
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,960
I just wanted to invite
you to supper.

593
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,263
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

594
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,233
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

595
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,301
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

596
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,370
This stinks of manure.
All of it.

597
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,776
Stop-- stop it.

598
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,271
You would turn me into one
of them, wouldn't you?

599
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,942
Next you'll want
to braid my hair.

600
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,010
You've no right
to a braid.

601
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,511
You've won
no victories yet.

602
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,681
You do not
talk back to me!

603
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,484
You are a horselord's slut.

604
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,453
And now you've woken
the dragon--

605
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,663
I am a Khaleesi
of the Dothraki!

606
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,066
I am the wife
of the great Khal

607
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,869
and I carry his son
inside me.

608
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:28,673
The next time
you raise a hand to me

609
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:31,943
will be the last time
you have hands.

610
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,653
I know for a fact
that some of the officers

611
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:43,655
go to that brothel
in mole's town.

612
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,490
I wouldn't doubt it.

613
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:47,959
Don't you think it's
a little bit unfair?

614
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,128
Making us take our vows
while they sneak off

615
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,763
for a little
sally on the side?

616
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,566
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

617
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,937
What, we can't defend
the wall unless we're celibate?

618
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:00,794
It's absurd.

619
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,873
I didn't think you'd be
so upset about it.

620
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:06,545
Why not?

621
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:09,040
- Because I'm fat?
- No.

622
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:12,160
But I like girls just
as much as you do.

623
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:15,856
They might not
like me as much.

624
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:21,061
I've never--
been with one.

625
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:24,331
You've probably
had hundreds.

626
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:26,033
No.

627
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,871
As a matter of fact,

628
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:32,339
I'm the same as you.

629
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:34,374
Yeah.

630
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,610
I find that hard
to believe.

631
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:38,946
I came very close once.

632
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,415
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but--

633
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,751
you didn't know
where to put it?

634
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,819
I know where to put it.

635
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:48,888
Was she...

636
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:51,057
Old and ugly?

637
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:53,859
Young and gorgeous.

638
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:57,396
A whore named Ros.

639
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:01,166
What color hair?

640
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,035
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

641
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,371
And her, um...

642
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,106
Her...

643
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,808
- You don't want to know.
- That good?

644
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,610
- Better.
- Oh no.

645
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:17,949
So why exactly

646
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:21,686
did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect--?

647
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,189
What's my name?

648
00:40:24,223 --> 00:40:26,125
Jon Snow?

649
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,462
And why is
my surname snow?

650
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:32,299
Because...

651
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,901
You're a bastard
from the North.

652
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,972
I never met my mother.

653
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:41,974
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

654
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,644
I don't know if she's
living or dead.

655
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:49,114
I don't know
if she's a noblewoman

656
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:50,783
or a Fisherman's wife...

657
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:54,486
Or a whore.

658
00:40:56,723 --> 00:40:59,091
So I sat there

659
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,328
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

660
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:05,932
But I couldn't do it.

661
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:08,969
Because all I could
think was

662
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:11,672
what if I got her pregnant

663
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,741
and she had a child,

664
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,710
another bastard named Snow?

665
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:24,085
It's not a good life
for a child.

666
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,320
Ah, mmm.

667
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:30,958
So...

668
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:33,394
You didn't know
where to put it?

669
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:41,202
<i>Enjoying yourselves?</i>

670
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:45,140
You look cold, boys.

671
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,443
It is a bit nippy.

672
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:50,879
A bit nippy,
yeah, by the fire,

673
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:55,050
indoors.
It's still summer.

674
00:41:56,218 --> 00:41:58,921
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

675
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,725
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

676
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:04,860
I remember.

677
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:07,596
Was it uncomfortable
at Winterfell?

678
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:10,266
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

679
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,135
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

680
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,371
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

681
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:20,575
I spent six months out there,
beyond The Wall

682
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,512
<i>during the last winter.</i>

683
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:26,649
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

684
00:42:26,684 --> 00:42:30,119
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

685
00:42:30,154 --> 00:42:33,523
So we went out to look
for some of his men--

686
00:42:33,557 --> 00:42:36,459
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

687
00:42:36,494 --> 00:42:39,462
The Wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

688
00:42:39,497 --> 00:42:42,531
Harder than you'll ever be.

689
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:45,000
They know their country
better than we do.

690
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:47,370
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

691
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:51,674
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

692
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:55,644
And we got caught
in the open.

693
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:57,980
Wind so strong

694
00:42:58,014 --> 00:43:00,516
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground,

695
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,019
<i>roots and all.</i>
<i>If you took your gloves off</i>

696
00:43:03,053 --> 00:43:05,054
<i>to find your cock</i>
<i>to have a piss,</i>

697
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:07,390
you lost a finger
to the frost.

698
00:43:07,424 --> 00:43:09,758
And all in darkness.

699
00:43:12,996 --> 00:43:15,464
You don't know cold.

700
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:17,899
Neither of you do.

701
00:43:20,036 --> 00:43:22,671
The horses died first.

702
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:27,609
We didn't have enough to feed them,
to keep them warm.

703
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:32,314
Eating the horses was easy.

704
00:43:34,283 --> 00:43:37,385
But later when <i>we</i>
started to fall...

705
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:41,389
That wasn't easy.

706
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:44,958
We should have had a couple of
boys like you along, shouldn't we?

707
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:52,932
Soft, fat boys like you.

708
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:55,436
We'd have lasted
a fortnight on you

709
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,506
and still had bones
leftover for soup.

710
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:04,012
Soon we'll have
new recruits

711
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:07,082
and you lot will be passed along
to the Lord Commander

712
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:09,251
for assignment

713
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:13,222
and they will call you
men of The Night's Watch,

714
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:15,991
but you'd be fools
to believe it.

715
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:19,428
<i>You're boys still.</i>

716
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:22,564
<i>And come the winter</i>
<i>you will die...</i>

717
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:26,700
Like flies.

718
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:34,775
I hit him.

719
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,710
I hit the dragon.

720
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:39,180
Your brother Rhaegar
was the Last Dragon.

721
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:42,117
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

722
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:44,019
He is still
the true king.

723
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:46,054
The truth now:

724
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:49,358
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

725
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,894
No.

726
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:54,830
But the common people
are waiting for him.

727
00:44:54,865 --> 00:44:59,201
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
banners and praying for his return.

728
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:03,371
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

729
00:45:03,406 --> 00:45:06,874
They don't care what games
the high lords play.

730
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:09,743
What do you pray for,
Ser Jorah?

731
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:16,783
Home.

732
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,985
I pray for home too.

733
00:45:22,323 --> 00:45:25,459
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

734
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:30,431
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

735
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:36,237
He'll never take us home.

736
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:58,059
Lover's quarrel?

737
00:45:58,094 --> 00:45:59,895
I'm sorry.
Do I...?

738
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:03,032
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
He's known--

739
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:04,567
an old friend
of the family.

740
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:07,805
I've known your mother
a long long time.

741
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,140
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

742
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,143
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

743
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:16,813
When I was a child
I was very small

744
00:46:16,848 --> 00:46:19,716
and I come from a little spit of land
called The Fingers,

745
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,518
so you see,

746
00:46:21,552 --> 00:46:23,619
it's an exceedingly
clever nickname.

747
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:26,188
I've been sitting here
for days!

748
00:46:26,223 --> 00:46:28,223
Start the damn joust

749
00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:30,192
before I piss myself!

750
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:40,302
Gods, who is that?

751
00:46:40,336 --> 00:46:42,838
<i>Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

752
00:46:42,873 --> 00:46:45,975
<i>They call him the Mountain.</i>

753
00:46:47,411 --> 00:46:50,080
<i>The hound's older brother.</i>

754
00:46:50,114 --> 00:46:53,083
- And his opponent?
- Littlefinger: Ser Hugh of the Vale.

755
00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:55,519
<i>He was</i>
<i>Jon Arryn's squire.</i>

756
00:46:55,553 --> 00:46:57,220
<i>Lo how far he's come.</i>

757
00:46:57,255 --> 00:46:59,489
Yes yes, enough
of the bloody pomp.

758
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:00,990
Have at it!

759
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:24,045
Not what you
were expecting?

760
00:48:26,883 --> 00:48:30,652
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

761
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:34,290
Lovely little tale
of brotherly love.

762
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:38,594
The Hound was just a pup,

763
00:48:38,628 --> 00:48:41,029
six years old maybe.

764
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:43,265
Gregor a few years older--

765
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:46,735
already a big lad, already
getting a bit of a reputation.

766
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:49,204
Some lucky boys

767
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:52,407
<i>just born with a talent</i>
<i>for violence.</i>

768
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:57,079
<i>One evening Gregor found</i>
<i>his little brother</i>

769
00:48:57,113 --> 00:48:59,749
<i>playing with a toy</i>
<i>by the fire--</i>

770
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:01,984
<i>Gregor's toy,</i>

771
00:49:02,018 --> 00:49:04,420
a wooden knight.

772
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:06,922
Gregor never said a word,

773
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:09,725
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

774
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,962
<i>and shoved his face</i>
<i>into the burning coals.</i>

775
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:15,231
<i>Held him there</i>

776
00:49:15,265 --> 00:49:17,233
<i>while the boy screamed,</i>

777
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:19,668
<i>while his face melted.</i>

778
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:26,542
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

779
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:29,245
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

780
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,180
No, please don't.

781
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:33,649
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

782
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:36,685
I'm afraid all the knights
in King's Landing

783
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,054
would not be able
to save you.

784
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:54,800
My Lord,
her Grace the Queen.

785
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,472
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

786
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:03,074
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

787
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:08,313
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us--

788
00:50:08,347 --> 00:50:10,582
the ugliness
with the wolves.

789
00:50:12,752 --> 00:50:15,354
And forcing you to kill
the beast was extreme.

790
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,093
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

791
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:23,329
How is Sansa?

792
00:50:23,364 --> 00:50:25,265
She likes it here.

793
00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:27,033
<i>She's the only</i>
<i>Stark who does.</i>

794
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:29,569
Favors her mother,

795
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:31,371
not much
of the North in her.

796
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:34,808
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

797
00:50:34,842 --> 00:50:37,010
What is it you
hope to accomplish?

798
00:50:37,044 --> 00:50:40,113
The King called on me
to serve him and the realm,

799
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:42,882
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

800
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:45,384
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

801
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:47,987
He'll do what he wants, which is
all he's ever done.

802
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:50,989
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

803
00:50:51,024 --> 00:50:53,759
If that's my job,
then so be it.

804
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,697
You're just a soldier,
aren't you?

805
00:50:57,731 --> 00:51:00,466
You take your orders
and you carry on.

806
00:51:01,502 --> 00:51:03,669
I suppose it makes sense.

807
00:51:03,704 --> 00:51:07,040
Your older brother was trained to
lead and you were trained to follow.

808
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:10,042
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, your Grace.

809
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:15,582
As was I.

810
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,434
Seven blessings to you,
goodfolk!

811
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,803
And to you.

812
00:51:37,837 --> 00:51:39,804
Boy!
Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

813
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,240
Ah, good idea, grandfather.
I'm starving.

814
00:51:42,274 --> 00:51:44,075
A song
while we wait or--?

815
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:45,910
I'd rather throw myself
down a well.

816
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:49,580
Now now, grandfather, this may be your
last chance if you're heading North.

817
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:52,617
The only music the Northerners know is
the howling of wolves!

818
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,387
Gods.

819
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,922
I'm sorry, My Lord.
We're full up.

820
00:51:57,956 --> 00:52:00,958
- <i>Every room.</i>
- Tyrion: <i>My men can sleep in the stable.</i>

821
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,628
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

822
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,831
Truly, My Lord,
we have nothing.

823
00:52:06,865 --> 00:52:09,200
Is there nothing I can do...

824
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:11,803
...To remedy this?

825
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,705
You can have my room.

826
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:15,273
Now there's
a clever man.

827
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,911
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

828
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:22,047
- Aye, My Lord.
- My Lord of Lannister!

829
00:52:22,081 --> 00:52:24,182
Might I entertain you
while you eat?

830
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:27,118
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

831
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:29,786
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

832
00:52:30,755 --> 00:52:32,422
Lady Stark!

833
00:52:32,456 --> 00:52:35,158
<i>What an unexpected</i>
<i>pleasure.</i>

834
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:38,728
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

835
00:52:38,763 --> 00:52:40,630
Lady Stark!

836
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:50,640
I was still Catelyn Tully

837
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:53,176
the last time
I stayed here.

838
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,315
You, Ser,

839
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:02,586
is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

840
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,655
It is, My Lady.

841
00:53:04,689 --> 00:53:07,525
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

842
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,363
to my father, Lord Hoster Tully
of Riverrun?

843
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:13,166
She is.

844
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:18,671
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

845
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:20,907
My father counts
Jonas Bracken

846
00:53:20,941 --> 00:53:24,043
amongst his oldest
and most loyal bannermen.

847
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:25,945
Our lord is honored
by his trust.

848
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:28,281
I envy your father

849
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:29,982
all his fine friends,
Lady Stark,

850
00:53:30,017 --> 00:53:33,086
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

851
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:36,956
I know your sigil as well--

852
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:40,660
the Twin Towers
of Frey.

853
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:42,963
How fares your lord, Ser?

854
00:53:42,997 --> 00:53:44,965
Lord Walder is well,
My Lady.

855
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:47,801
<i>He has asked your father</i>
<i>for the honor of his presence</i>

856
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:49,403
on his 90th Nameday.

857
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:51,705
He plans to take another wife.

858
00:53:58,413 --> 00:54:00,882
This man

859
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:03,251
came into my house
as a guest

860
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:07,187
and there conspired
to murder my son,

861
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:10,725
a boy of 10.

862
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:15,596
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

863
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,399
I call upon you
to seize him

864
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:22,003
and help me return him
to Winterfell

865
00:54:22,037 --> 00:54:24,072
to await the King's Justice.
