2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,951
Out west there was this fella,

3
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:45,167
fella I want to tell you about,

4
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:48,457
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski -

5
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,964
at least that's the handle
his parents gave him.

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,503
But he never had
much use for it himself.

7
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:59,463
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

8
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,970
Now, Dude, that's a name
no one would self-apply

9
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:05,970
where I come from.

10
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:10,855
There was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make sense to me,

11
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:14,192
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

12
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:17,772
But then again,

13
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:21,862
maybe that's why I found
the place so darn interesting.

14
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:29,699
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

15
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,957
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

16
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:36,293
But there are
some nice folks there.

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,748
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

18
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,248
and I never been to France,

19
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:46,256
and I ain't never seen
no queen in her damned undies.

20
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:49,346
But I'll tell you what,

21
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:51,590
after seeing Los Angeles

22
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:54,554
and this story
I'm about to unfold,

23
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:59,140
well, I guess I seen somethin'
every bit as stupefyin'

24
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,018
as you'd see
in any other places,

25
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,315
and in English, too.

26
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,237
So I can die
with a smile on my face

27
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,524
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

28
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:13,285
Now, this story
I'm about to unfold

29
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,526
took place
back in the early 90s,

30
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,530
about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.

31
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:24,039
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man -

32
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:28,254
I won't say a hero,
'cause what's a hero?

33
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:31,256
But sometimes there's a man -

34
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:34,341
and I'm talking
about the Dude here -

35
00:02:34,427 --> 00:02:36,964
sometimes there's a man...

36
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:41,798
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

37
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:44,049
He fits right in there,

38
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:46,764
and that's the Dude,

39
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,810
in Los Angeles.

40
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:51,732
And even if he's a lazy man,

41
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:54,769
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

42
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,442
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

43
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,439
which would place him high

44
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,651
in the running
for laziest worldwide.

45
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:06,067
But sometimes there's a man,

46
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,118
sometimes...

47
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,280
there's a man...

48
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:14,322
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

49
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:17,537
But... ah, hell.

50
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,455
I done introduced him enough.

51
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:22,713
'This will not stand.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,631
'This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.'

53
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:58,611
Where's the money, Lebowski?

54
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,030
I want that money, Lebowski.
Bunny says you're good for it.

55
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,746
Where's the money, Lebowski?

56
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:09,041
Where's the money, Lebowski?

57
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,417
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?

58
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:17,005
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

59
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:20,011
Don't fuck with us!

60
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:24,467
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn.

61
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:27,594
That means you owe
money to Jackie Treehorn.

62
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:30,520
Ever thus
to deadbeats, Lebowski.

63
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,063
Don't do that...

64
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,517
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?

65
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,729
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,856
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong man.

67
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,656
I'm the Dude, man.

68
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:48,904
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.
Your wife is Bunny.

69
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,623
My... my wife... my wife, Bunny?

70
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:54,864
Do you see a wedding ring?

71
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,246
Does this place
look like I'm married?

72
00:04:57,335 --> 00:04:59,706
The toilet seat's up, man.

73
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:09,085
What the fuck is this?

74
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:12,344
Obviously, you're not a golfer.

75
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:16,471
- Woo?
- Yeah?

76
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:20,009
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

77
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:21,846
Fuck!

78
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:26,769
- Yeah, what do you think?
- He looks like a fucking loser.

79
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,729
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

80
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,733
Fucking time wasted.
Thanks a lot, asshole.

81
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:46,802
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

82
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,305
This was a valued rug.
This was a...

83
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:53,309
It really
tied the room together.

84
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:55,517
So this was a valued...

85
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,312
- What tied the room together?
- My rug.

86
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,307
- Were you listening, Donny?
- What?

87
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,855
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?

88
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,318
I was bowling.

89
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:07,447
You have no frame of reference,
like a child who wanders in...

90
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:09,358
Walter, what's the point?

91
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,525
There's no reason -
here's my point, Dude -

92
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,990
- there's no reason...
- Yeah, what's your point?

93
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,366
- Huh?
- Walter, what is the point...

94
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,862
We know who is at fault here.

95
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,914
What the fuck
are you talking about?

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,752
No, what the fuck are you...
I'm not...

97
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,872
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here.

98
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,707
- What is he talking about?
- My rug.

99
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:31,254
Forget it,
you're out of your element.

100
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:35,173
The Chinaman who peed on my rug,
I can't go give him a bill.

101
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,966
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

102
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:40,179
The Chinaman
is not the issue here.

103
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,302
I'm talking about
drawing a line in the sand.

104
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:45,682
Across this line, you do not...

105
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:49,353
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,397
"Asian-American," please.

107
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:55,066
This isn't a guy who built
the railroads here...

108
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:57,644
- What the fuck...
- He peed on my rug.

109
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:01,522
- He peed on the Dude's rug.
- You're out of your element!

110
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:04,487
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

111
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,866
- So, who... who...
- Jeff Lebowski.

112
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:10,654
The other Jeffrey Lebowski,
the millionaire.

113
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,584
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

114
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,788
Plus, he has the wealth
and the resources...

115
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,452
so there's no reason,
no fucking reason

116
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:22,169
why his wife
should go out, owe money,

117
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,832
and then they pee
on your fucking rug!

118
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:26,671
- Am I wrong?
- No.

119
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,422
- Am I wrong?
- But...

120
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,340
OK, then.

121
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:34,096
That rug really tied
the room together, did it not?

122
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:36,391
- Fuckin' A!
- And he peed on it.

123
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,056
Donny, please.

124
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:41,017
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

125
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:44,273
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

126
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,859
He should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

127
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:51,646
His wife owes money,
and they pee on my rug?

128
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:55,441
- They pee on your fucking rug.
- They peed on my fucking rug.

129
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,327
That's right, Dude.

130
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:00,615
They peed on your fucking rug.

131
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,500
This is the study.
The various commendations...

132
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,661
Jeffrey Lebowski.

133
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:10,957
- Honorary degrees, etcetera.
- Very impressive.

134
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,539
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

135
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:17,049
- Oh, I'm not really that...
- Oh, please, please.

136
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:19,544
That is the key
to the city of Pasadena,

137
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,099
which Mr Lebowski received in
recognition of various civic...

138
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:26,011
Oh, that's the Los Angeles

139
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,889
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

140
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,553
which is... not
necessarily given every year.

141
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:35,099
Hey, is this, uh,
is this him with Nancy?

142
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:39,320
Yes, indeed, that is Mr Lebowski
with the First Lady...

143
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,978
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

144
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,694
Of course.
Mr Lebowski on the left...

145
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:47,868
He's a cripple... you know,
a... handicapped guy?

146
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:51,404
Mr Lebowski is disabled, yes.
This picture was taken

147
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:54,498
when Mrs Reagan was
First Lady of the nation.

148
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:57,537
- Yes, yes. Not of California.
- Pope John.

149
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,118
He met privately
with the president,

150
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,834
but there was no time
for a photo opportunity.

151
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:05,130
- Nancy's pretty good.
- Wonderful woman!

152
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:07,044
These are...

153
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:10,338
Those are Mr Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

154
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,553
Different mothers?
Racially, pretty cool.

155
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:17,012
They're not literally
his children.

156
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:19,427
They're the Little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

157
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,892
inner-city children of promise

158
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,768
but without the means
for a higher education.

159
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,693
Mr Lebowski is committed
to sending them to college.

160
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:30,350
Excuse me. Thank you, thank you.

161
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:33,400
Far out. Think he's
got room for one more?

162
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,779
One, uh... Oh!

163
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:40,277
You never went to college.
Please, don't touch that.

164
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:43,288
Yeah, I did, but I spent
most of my time...

165
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:46,409
occupying various
administration buildings,

166
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,493
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

167
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,207
breaking into the R.O.T.C.
And bowling.

168
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:53,752
To tell you the truth,
I don't remember much.

169
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:02,630
OK, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

170
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,631
that's terrific.

171
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,760
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.

172
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,223
What can I do for you, sir?

173
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,846
Well, sir, it's this rug I have,

174
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,810
it really tied
the room together...

175
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:20,732
You told Brandt, he told me.
Where do I fit in?

176
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:24,070
Well, they were
looking for you, these guys.

177
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:26,196
I'll say it again.

178
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:29,449
You told Brandt
on the phone, he told me.

179
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:31,362
I know what happened. Yes?

180
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:34,988
So you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug?

181
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:37,489
Did I urinate on your rug?

182
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:40,157
Did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

183
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:43,503
Hello! Do you speak English?
Parla usted ingles?

184
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,625
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

185
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:49,800
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

186
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:52,044
I want to understand this, sir.

187
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,838
Every time a rug is
micturated upon in this city,

188
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:57,557
I have to compensate...

189
00:12:57,642 --> 00:13:01,473
Come on, man, I'm not
trying to scam anybody here.

190
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,353
I... I was just...

191
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,889
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

192
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,770
Are you employed, Mr Lebowski?

193
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,478
Wait, let me
explain something to you.

194
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:17,023
I am not Mr Lebowski.
You're Mr Lebowski.

195
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:20,070
I'm the Dude.
So that's what you call me,

196
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:23,576
you know, uh, that
or, uh, his Dudeness,

197
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:26,617
or Duder, or, you
know, uh, el Duderino,

198
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,827
if you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

199
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:33,417
- Are you employed, sir?
- Employed?

200
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:38,794
You don't look for a job
dressed like that on a weekday?

201
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,920
Is this a... What day is this?

202
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:45,546
Well, I do work, sir.
So if you don't mind...

203
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,964
No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

204
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:50,097
This will not stand, you know.

205
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:53,304
This aggression
will not stand, man.

206
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:57,345
- I mean, your wife owes...
- My wife is not the issue!

207
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:01,520
I hope that my wife will learn
to live on her ample allowance.

208
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:04,896
If not, that's
her problem, not mine,

209
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,981
just as the rug is your problem,

210
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:11,569
just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,

211
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,032
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

212
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:17,240
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

213
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:20,167
Some Chinaman
took them from me in Korea.

214
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:23,370
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

215
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,329
I cannot solve your problems,
sir, only you can.

216
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,463
- Oh, fuck it.
- "Oh, fuck it."

217
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,256
Yes, that's your answer
to everything.

218
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:35,804
Tattoo it on your forehead.

219
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:39,174
Your revolution
is over, Mr Lebowski!

220
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,887
Condolences! The bums lost!

221
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:45,642
My advice to you
is to do what your parents did!

222
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,521
Get a job, sir!

223
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:51,769
The bums will always lose!
Do you hear me, Lebowski?

224
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,354
The bums...

225
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:57,735
How was your meeting,
Mr Lebowski?

226
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:02,319
OK. The old man told me
to take any rug in the house.

227
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,573
Well, enjoy, and perhaps
we'll see you again, Dude.

228
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:10,577
Sure, if I'm in
the neighbourhood, you know,

229
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,541
and, um...

230
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:14,952
I need to use the john.

231
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:27,930
Blow on them.

232
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,386
Go ahead, blow.

233
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:35,266
You want me to blow
on your toes?

234
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:38,603
Uh-huh. I can't blow that far.

235
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,110
Are you sure he won't mind?

236
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,980
He doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

237
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,648
Oh, that must be exhausting.

238
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,535
You're not blowing.

239
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,574
He has to be getting along,
Mrs Lebowski.

240
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:00,822
Oh, you're Bunny.

241
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,576
I'll suck your cock for $1,000.

242
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,457
Wonderful woman.

243
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:13,218
We're very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

244
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:15,970
Brandt can't watch,
or he has to pay 100.

245
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,547
That's marvellous.

246
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:24,466
I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.

247
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:30,851
Whoo! Slamming them tonight!

248
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:33,099
You guys are dead in the water.

249
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,979
All right! Way to go, Donny!

250
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,770
If you will it, it is no dream.

251
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,984
You're 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

252
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,984
Theodore Herzel.

253
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:49,157
The state of Israel. If you
will it, Dude, it is no dream.

254
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:52,995
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

255
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:56,666
Oh, Cynthia's dog.
I think it's a Pomeranian.

256
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,911
I can't leave him,
he eats the furniture.

257
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:01,543
I'm watching it
while they're in Hawaii.

258
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:05,048
- You brought it bowling?
- "Brought it bowling"?

259
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:08,301
I didn't rent it shoes,
I'm not buying it a beer,

260
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,510
he's not taking your turn, Dude.

261
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:13,966
If my ex-wife asked me
to take care of her dog

262
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,763
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

263
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:18,596
I'd tell her to fuck herself.

264
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,727
Dude, you don't have an ex,

265
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:23,850
and this is a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.

266
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:28,520
You can't board it. It gets
upset. Its hair falls out.

267
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,652
Over the line!

268
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:34,190
Sorry, you were over the line.
That's a foul.

269
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:36,276
Bullshit. Mark it 8, Dude.

270
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:39,239
Excuse me, mark it zero.
Next frame.

271
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,571
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

272
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:44,950
This is not 'Nam, this
is bowling. There are rules.

273
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,368
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's Smokey.

274
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,627
His toe slipped over.
It's just a game.

275
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:54,296
It determines who enters
the round-robin. Am I wrong?

276
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:56,175
- Yeah, but...
- Am I wrong?

277
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,217
Yeah, but I wasn't over.

278
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:01,008
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an 8.

279
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:04,715
Smokey, my friend,
you're entering a world of pain.

280
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,299
- Walter...
- You mark that frame an 8,

281
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:10,311
you're entering a world of pain.

282
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:13,183
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.

283
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:15,681
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

284
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,567
Has the world gone crazy?

285
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:20,439
Am I the only one
who cares about the rules?

286
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,905
Mark it zero!

287
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,109
- They're calling the cops.
- Mark it zero!

288
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,905
- Put the piece away.
- Walter...

289
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:30,615
You think I'm fucking around?
Mark it zero!

290
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:39,625
All right, it's fucking zero.

291
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,045
You happy, you crazy fuck?

292
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,796
It's a league game, Smoke.

293
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,054
You can't do that, man.

294
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,468
These guys are like me.
They're pacifists.

295
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:55,596
Smokey was
a conscientious objector.

296
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:58,435
I myself dabbled in pacifism,

297
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,595
not in 'Nam, of course.

298
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,261
You know he's got
emotional problems.

299
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,681
You mean, beyond pacifism?

300
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:09,274
He's fragile, very fragile.

301
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:13,109
I did not know that.

302
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:16,364
Well, it's all
water under the bridge,

303
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,071
and we do enter
the next round-robin.

304
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,652
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.

305
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:24,996
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're just an asshole!

306
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:28,700
OK. We play Quintana
and O'Brien next week.

307
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,498
They should be pushovers.

308
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,078
Man, will you just...

309
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,415
Just take it easy, man.

310
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,833
That's your answer
for everything, Dude.

311
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:44,003
Look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq.

312
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,423
Pacifism is not
something to hide behind.

313
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,722
Just take it easy, man.

314
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,767
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

315
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:54,352
- Waving the fucking gun around?
- Calmer than you are.

316
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,147
Just take it easy!

317
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,189
Calmer than you are.

318
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:05,319
'Dude, this is Smokey.

319
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:07,483
'I don't want to
be a hard-on about this.

321

will submit this to the league

00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,793
'So, like I say,
you know, fair warning.

326

this is Brandt at, uh,

- Hey, Monty.

Dude, I... I finally got...
the venue I wanted.

336
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,950
I'm performing my dance quintet,
you know, my cycle,

at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street Theatre on Tuesday night.

338
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:11,625
And, well, I'd love it
if you came and gave me notes.

339
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:13,620
I'll be there, man.

340
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:19,499
Tomorrow's already the 10th.

341
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:21,466
Far out.

342
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,718
Oh. Oh, all right, OK.

343
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:29,427
Just slip the rent

We've had terrible news.
Mr Lebowski's in seclusion.

354
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:09,835
Mr Lebowski.

355
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,717
Funny...

356
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:21,889
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

357
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:24,218
challenges met,

358
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:26,268
competitors bested,

359
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:29,106
obstacles overcome.

360
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:33,772
I've accomplished more
than most men

361
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:36,434
and without the use of my legs.

362
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,113
What...

363
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:42,781
What makes a man, Mr Lebowski?

364
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:46,200
Dude.

365
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:50,742
I... I don't know, sir.

366
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,999
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

367
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,954
Whatever the cost?

368
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:00,882
Isn't that what makes a man?

369
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:03,042
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

370
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:06,508
You're joking. But...

371
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,387
Perhaps you're right.

372
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,965
You mind if I do a "J"?

373
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,472
Bunny...

374
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,055
Excuse me?

375
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,685
Bunny Lebowski,

376
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,692
she is the light of my life.

377
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:27,897
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

378
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:31,821
Fuckin' A.

379
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:35,158
Strong men also cry.

380
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:39,409
Strong men also cry.

381
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,869
I received this fax
this morning.

382
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:49,543
As you can see,

383
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,670
it is a ransom note.

384
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:54,628
"We have Bunnie."

385
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:59,214
Sent by men who can't achieve
on a level field of play.

386
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:02,010
"Gather one million dollars

387
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:05,135
in unmarked,
non-consecutive twenties."

388
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:08,144
- Weaklings!
- "Await instructions."

389
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,021
- Bums!
- "No funny stuff."

390
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:13,605
- Bummer.
- Huh?

391
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:15,649
This is a bummer, man.

392
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,609
That's, uh, that's a bummer.

393
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:21,443
Brandt will
fill you in on the details.

394
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:38,835
Mr Lebowski will make you
a generous offer

395
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:42,965
to act as courier once we get
instructions for the money.

396
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,508
Why me, man?

397
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:47,676
He believes the culprits
might be the people

398
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:50,252
who, uh... soiled your rug,

399
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:54,925
and you're in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm this.

400
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:57,306
He thinks
the carpet-pissers did this?

401
00:24:57,394 --> 00:24:59,932
Well, Dude, we just don't know.

402
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,383
Fucking Quintana.

403
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:40,884
That creep can roll, man.

404
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,018
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.

405
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,849
Yeah.

406
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,941
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

407
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:51,608
He did six months for exposing
himself to an 8-year-old.

408
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:54,815
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door-to-door

409
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,698
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

410
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,155
What's a pederast, Walter?

411
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,699
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

412
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,371
- So... How much they give you?
- 20 grand, man.

413
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,206
- And I get to keep the rug.
- Just for making a hand-off?

414
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:13,501
Yeah. They gave Dude a beeper.

415
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:17,372
- So whenever they call...
- What if it's during a game?

416
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:21,380
- If it's during league play...
- What's during league play?

417
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,506
Life doesn't stop and start
at your convenience,

418
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:27,717
- you piece of shit.
- What's wrong with Walter?

419
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:30,477
I figure it's easy money.
It's harmless.

420
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:34,143
- She probably did it herself.
- What do you mean, Dude?

421
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,935
Rug pee-ers didn't do this.
Look at it.

422
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:40,973
A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

423
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:43,476
She figures
he isn't giving her enough.

424
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,528
You know, she owes money.

425
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:49,362
- That fuckin'... bitch.
- It's all goddamn fake, man.

426
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,609
It's like Lenin said.

427
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,787
You look for the person
who will benefit,

428
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:58,038
- and, uh, you know...
- I am the walrus?

429
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,497
You know, you'll, uh...

430
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:03,206
- You know what I'm saying.
- I am the walrus.

431
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,122
That fuckin' bitch!

432
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:08,049
- I am the walrus.
- Shut the fuck up, Donny!

433
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,670
V.I. Lenin.
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

434
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,048
What the fuck
is he talking about?

435
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:16,173
Fucking exactly what happened.
That makes me sick.

436
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:18,969
- What do you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.

437
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,885
This whole fuckin' thing.

438
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:23,977
I didn't watch my buddies die
face-down in the mud

439
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:27,146
so that this fucking strumpet,
this fucking whore...

440
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:29,687
I don't see
any connection with Vietnam.

441
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,270
No literal connection.

442
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,314
Face it, there's no
connection. Your roll.

443
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:37,239
- But my point is...
- Your roll.

444
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,316
Are you ready to be fucked?

445
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:43,866
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

446
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:46,623
Dios mio, man.

447
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:49,790
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

448
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:54,252
Yeah? Well... you know,
that's just like, uh...

449
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:56,294
your opinion, man.

450
00:28:57,173 --> 00:28:59,960
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

451
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,086
you pull any crazy shit with us,

452
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:05,549
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

453
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:08,722
I'll take it
and stick it up your ass

454
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:11,973
and pull the fuckin' trigger
till it goes click.

455
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:16,676
- Jesus.
- You said it, man.

456
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:19,891
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

457
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,854
8-year-olds, Dude.

458
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:20,789
Ohh, man.

459
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:32,755
They called 80 minutes ago.

460
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,628
Take the money,
drive north on the 405.

461
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:38,885
They will call you with
instructions in 40 minutes.

462
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:42,968
One person only. They were clear
on that, or I'd go with you.

463
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:45,809
- What happened to your jaw?
- Oh, nothin'.

464
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:51,059
Here's the money. And the phone.

465
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,852
Please, Dude,
follow their instructions.

466
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:55,400
All right.

467
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:59,067
- Her life is in your hands.
- Oh, man, don't say that.

468
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:01,147
Mr Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

469
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,564
- Her life is in your hands.
- Shit, man.

470
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:05,484
Her life is in your hands, Dude.

471
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:08,530
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

472
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,245
Where the fuck are you goin'?

473
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,294
Take the ringer. I'll drive.

474
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:24,050
- What? The what?
- The ringer.

475
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,090
The ringer, Dude.

476
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:35,720
- What the...
- Have they called?

477
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:38,928
- What the hell is this?
- My dirty undies, Dude.

478
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,593
Laundry. The whites.

479
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:45,437
I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies.

480
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,683
The weight.
The ringer cannot look empty.

481
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:49,604
What the fuck are you thinking?

482
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:52,067
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking,

483
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:54,990
why should we settle for
a measly fuckin' 20 grand...

484
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:57,909
We? You said
you just wanted to come along.

485
00:32:57,994 --> 00:33:00,401
Why should we settle
for 20 grand

486
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:03,165
when we can keep
the entire million? Am I wrong?

487
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,083
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a game, man.

488
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,492
It is a game.
You said so yourself.

489
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,255
- She kidnapped herself.
- I said I thought...

490
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:20,383
- Dude here.
- 'Who is this?'

491
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,088
Dude the bagman.
Where do you want us to go?

492
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:27,052
- 'Us? '
- Shit!

493
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:32,637
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

494
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,063
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car...

495
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,103
- 'Shut the fuck up! '
- Are you fucking this up?

496
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:41,270
Who is that?

497
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:43,900
That is the driver.
I told you...

498
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:48,106
- Shit!
- What the fuck's goin' on?

499
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,359
- Walter!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

500
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:53,786
He hung up! You fucked it up!
You fucked it up!

501
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:56,707
- Her life was in our hands.
- Easy, Dude.

502
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:59,163
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

503
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:02,205
They're gonna kill her.
We're fucked, Walter.

504
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:05,711
Nothing is fucked, Dude.
You're being very unDude.

505
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,124
They'll call back.
She kidnapped...

506
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:13,177
You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.

507
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:15,671
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs!

508
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:18,137
Hey, will you shut the fuck up?

509
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:21,143
Don't say peep
while I'm doin' business here.

510
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,553
OK, Dude, have it your way.

511
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,316
- But they're amateurs.
- Fuck.

512
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,518
- Dude.
- 'OK, we proceed,

513
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:32,769
'but only if there's
no funny stuff.'

514
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,736
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,862
'So no funny stuff, OK? '

516
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,618
Just tell me
where the fuck to go.

517
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:45,909
That was the sign, man.

518
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:49,201
So all we gotta do
is get her back.

519
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:52,542
No one can complain,
and we keep the baksheesh.

520
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:54,253
Terrific, Walter,

521
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,876
but how are we
gonna get her back?

522
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:58,958
That's the simple part, Dude.

523
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:02,834
We make the hand-off,
I grab one, beat it out of him.

524
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:06,214
- Huh?
- Yeah. That's a great plan.

525
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:09,722
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

526
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,849
It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.

527
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,806
Yeah, the beauty
of this is its simplicity.

528
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:17,566
If it gets complex,
everything can go wrong.

529
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,725
If I learned one thing
in 'Nam, it's...

530
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:26,102
- Dude.
- 'You're coming to a bridge.

531
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:28,107
'When you cross the bridge,

532
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,576
'you throw the bag from the left
window. You're being watched.'

533
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:34,203
Fuck!

534
00:35:34,288 --> 00:35:36,244
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

535
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:39,782
There isn't one, we throw
the money out of the car.

536
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:43,410
We throw the money
out of the moving car!

537
00:35:43,503 --> 00:35:46,872
We can't do that.
That fucks up our plan.

538
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:49,123
Call 'em and explain it to them.

539
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:53,463
You're plan is so simple
I'm sure they'll understand.

540
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:57,301
I'm throwin' the money, Walter.
We're not fuckin' around.

541
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,678
Bridge is comin' up.
Give me the ringer.

542
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:03,265
Fuck that. I love ya,
but you have to face the fact

543
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:06,057
- you're a goddamn moron.
- No time to argue.

544
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:07,807
- Hey, man.
- The bridge.

545
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,353
Hey, Walter! Hey! Walter!

546
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:12,648
There goes the ringer!

547
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,478
- What the fuck?
- Here, your wheel.

548
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:19,568
At 15 mph, I roll out,
grab one and beat it out of him.

549
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:21,484
- The Uzi.
- Uzi?

550
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,901
- I'm not rolling out naked.
- Walter, please!

551
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:25,868
15, Dude. This is it.

552
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,675
We have it! We have it!

553
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:55,847
We have it!

554
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:58,060
We... have it!

555
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,738
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

556
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:15,903
Let's go bowling.

557
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:57,104
Etz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

558
00:37:57,196 --> 00:37:59,235
What the fuck does that mean?

559
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:01,813
What the fuck
are we gonna tell Lebowski?

560
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:03,817
Huh? Oh, him. Uh...

561
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:08,361
Well, what exactly
is the problem?

562
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,494
The problem is...

563
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:12,870
What do you mean, what's the...

564
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,164
There was no...

565
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,789
We... we didn't, uh...

566
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,714
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

567
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,921
The poor woman...

568
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:26,626
That poor slut kidnapped
herself. You said so yourself.

569
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,293
I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

570
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:32,757
- You're the one who's certain.
- 100% certain.

571
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,554
- They posted the next round.
- Shut the fuck...

572
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:38,216
- When do we play?
- This Saturday.

573
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:40,388
Saturday?
They have to reschedule.

574
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:42,140
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

575
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,723
I told that fuck
at the league office...

576
00:38:44,818 --> 00:38:47,486
- Who's in charge of scheduling?
- Burkhalter.

577
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,606
I told that kraut
I don't roll on Shabbos.

578
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:53,651
- He already posted it.
- He can fuckin' unpost it!

579
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:57,074
Who gives a shit?
They're gonna kill that woman.

580
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:59,237
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

581
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:02,116
She'll get tired
of her game and go back.

582
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,697
- Why not on Saturday?
- I'm Shomer Shabbos.

583
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,500
What's that?

584
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,542
What do I tell Lebowski?

585
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,333
Saturday is Shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

586
00:39:11,423 --> 00:39:14,091
I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

587
00:39:14,175 --> 00:39:16,844
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

588
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:19,085
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

589
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:20,964
Sheesh.

590
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:23,261
Shomer Shabbos!

591
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:27,427
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking Shabbos.

592
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,053
- That's it! I'm outta here.
- Come on, Dude.

593
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,981
Dude! Dude!

594
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:37,143
Look, you just tell him...

595
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:40,401
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went...

596
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:43,109
- How'd it go?
- Went all right.

597
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:46,531
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand-off.

598
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,702
They didn't get the fuckin'
money! They're gonna...

599
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:54,448
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

600
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,494
If you can't go by car, how
do you get around on Shammos?

601
00:39:57,585 --> 00:39:59,459
Really, Dude, you surprise me.

602
00:39:59,545 --> 00:40:02,795
They're not gonna do shit.
What can they do to her?

603
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:04,256
They're amateurs, and meanwhile,

604
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:08,254
who's sittin' on a million
fucking dollars? Am I wrong?

605
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:12,261
Who's got a million
fuckin' dollars in our car?

606
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:14,007
Our car, Walter?

607
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,846
What do they got? My dirty
undies. My fuckin' whites.

608
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:24,555
Say, Dude...

609
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:27,566
where is your car?

610
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:29,394
Who's got your undies?

611
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:32,237
- Where's your car, Dude?
- You don't know?

612
00:40:32,322 --> 00:40:36,532
It was parked in a handicap
zone. Perhaps they towed it.

613
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,536
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

614
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,534
Well, certainly,
that's a possibility, Dude.

615
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:47,407
Oh, fuck it.

616
00:40:48,752 --> 00:40:52,369
- Where you goin', Dude?
- I'm going home, Donny.

617
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:55,666
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny.

618
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:11,016
Uh... yeah...

619
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:17,513
Green... uh, some brown or...

620
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,980
rust colouration.

621
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:23,069
Was there anything
of value in the car?

622
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:25,941
Oh. Uh, yeah...

623
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:29,317
a tape deck,
some Creedence tapes,

624
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,735
and there was a... uh...

625
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:35,488
My briefcase.

626
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:38,366
In the briefcase?

627
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:42,706
Uh, papers.

628
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:44,871
You know, just papers.

629
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:48,297
You know, my papers.
Business papers.

630
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,169
And what do you do, sir?

631
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,135
I'm unemployed.

632
00:41:56,932 --> 00:42:00,135
My rug was also stolen.

633
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:02,515
Your rug was in the car?

634
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,512
No, here.

635
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,930
Separate incidents?

636
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,609
'The Dude is not in... '

637
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:13,896
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

638
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:16,692
Sometimes.

639
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:20,613
- No hope for the tape deck.
- Or the Creedence.

640
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:24,200
Well, what about, uh...

641
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:25,948
The briefcase?

642
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:28,790
'Mr Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

643
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,326
'My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.'

644
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:37,537
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

645
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:26,453
Elfranco, ayúdame abajo.

646
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:30,840
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr Lebowski.

647
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:53,056
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr Lebowski?

648
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:55,274
Is that what
this is a picture of?

649
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:56,939
In a sense, yes.

650
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,529
My art is strongly vaginal,
which bothers some men.

651
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:04,744
The word itself makes some
men uncomfortable. Vagina.

652
00:44:04,828 --> 00:44:06,405
Oh, yeah?

653
00:44:06,496 --> 00:44:09,911
They find it difficult to say,
but without batting an eye,

654
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:14,078
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his... johnson.

655
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:17,749
- Johnson?
- All right, Mr Lebowski.

656
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,630
Let's get down to cases.

657
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:22,087
My father agreed
to let you have the rug,

658
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,583
but it was a gift from me
to my late mother,

659
00:44:24,677 --> 00:44:26,634
and not his to give. Now...

660
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:28,713
Your face.

661
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:31,296
As for this kidnapping...

662
00:44:31,391 --> 00:44:35,554
I know all about it,
and that you acted as courier.

663
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:39,855
Let me tell you something.
It stinks to high heaven.

664
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,225
Right, but let me explain
something about the rug.

665
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:46,651
- Do you like sex, Mr Lebowski?
- Excuse me?

666
00:44:46,737 --> 00:44:48,813
Sex. The physical act of love.

667
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:50,981
Coitus. Do you like it?

668
00:44:51,074 --> 00:44:53,031
I was talking about my rug.

669
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:56,616
- You're not interested in sex?
- You mean coitus?

670
00:44:56,704 --> 00:45:00,701
I like it. It's a myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

671
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,787
It can be a natural, zesty
enterprise. But some people -

672
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:07,581
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women -

673
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,340
engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

674
00:45:10,423 --> 00:45:13,756
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr Lebowski.

675
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:17,590
They cannot love
in the true sense of the word.

676
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,094
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

677
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:23,139
Listen, Maude,

678
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:27,092
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

679
00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:29,891
but what has that
to do with, uh...

680
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:33,728
- Do you have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.

681
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:39,358
Oh, I know that guy.

682
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:42,028
He's a nihilist.

683
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,572
Karl Hungus...

684
00:45:58,796 --> 00:46:01,465
- 'Hi.
- Hello. Meine dispatcher says

685
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:04,252
'there's something
wrong mit deine kabel.

686
00:46:04,342 --> 00:46:07,591
'Come in. I'm not sure
exactly what's wrong.

687
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:10,382
'Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

688
00:46:10,472 --> 00:46:13,881
- 'The TV's in here.'
- You recognise her, of course.

689
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:21,144
'That's my friend. She came
over to use the shower.'

690
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:23,437
The story is ludicrous.

691
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:26,608
'Meine name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.'

692
00:46:26,693 --> 00:46:28,567
'You're here to fix the cable.'

693
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:32,235
You can imagine
where it goes from here.

694
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:35,857
- He fixes the cable?
- Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

695
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:39,284
Little matter that she pursues
a career in pornography

696
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,612
nor that she's been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

697
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:44,113
to use the parlance
of our times.

698
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:48,074
But I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

699
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:50,043
the other being my father.

700
00:46:50,129 --> 00:46:52,038
The Foundation
takes youngsters...

701
00:46:52,131 --> 00:46:53,957
Shit, yeah, the achievers.

702
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:56,670
Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers, yes.

703
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,879
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million,

704
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,639
and he told me
about this abduction.

705
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:05,676
It is preposterous.
This compulsive fornicator

706
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:08,139
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

707
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:10,552
- But my...
- I'm getting to your rug.

708
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:12,519
My father and I don't get along.

709
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:15,855
We don't approve
of each other's lifestyles.

710
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:19,773
But I hardly wish to make his
embezzlement a police matter.

711
00:47:19,862 --> 00:47:24,190
I propose that you try
to recover the money.

712
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:27,733
Well, I could do that.

713
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:30,780
If you do so,
I will compensate you

714
00:47:30,871 --> 00:47:33,906
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

715
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:35,576
A hundred...

716
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:40,208
...thousand, yes, bones or clams
or whatever you call them.

717
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:43,995
Yeah, but...
what about my, uh...

718
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:47,173
Your rug. With that money
you can buy any rug

719
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:49,928
that doesn't have
sentimental value for me.

720
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:52,003
I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

721
00:47:52,096 --> 00:47:54,765
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even, uh...

722
00:47:54,848 --> 00:47:57,600
Here's the number of a doctor
who will look at it.

723
00:47:57,684 --> 00:48:00,554
You'll receive no bill.
He's a good man.

724
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:03,479
- That's thoughtful, but...
- Please see him.

725
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:05,390
He's a good man.

726
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:09,896
Oh, well... all right.

727
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:13,025
He says, "My wife's a pain.

728
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,314
"She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

729
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:18,200
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard,

730
00:48:18,284 --> 00:48:20,988
"and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

731
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:24,909
"I can't sit down. But you
know me, can't complain."

732
00:48:24,998 --> 00:48:28,164
Fuckin' A, man.
I got a rash, man.

733
00:48:28,251 --> 00:48:29,994
Fuckin' A.

734
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:32,208
I gotta tell you, man,

735
00:48:32,296 --> 00:48:35,794
earlier in the day,
I was feeling shitty, man.

736
00:48:35,882 --> 00:48:37,542
Down in the dumps.

737
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:39,672
Lost a little money...

738
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,175
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.

739
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:47,046
I can't be worried about
that shit. Life goes on, man.

740
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,098
Home, sweet home, Mr L.

741
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:56,560
Look. Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

742
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:01,229
Yeah, he followed us here.

743
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,604
When did he start foll...
What the fuck?

744
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:07,270
In the limo, you son of a bitch.
No arguing.

745
00:49:07,366 --> 00:49:09,691
Careful, man.
There's a beverage here.

746
00:49:10,994 --> 00:49:13,994
Start talking and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

747
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,487
We've been trying
to reach you, Dude.

748
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:19,416
Where's my goddamn money,
you bum?

749
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:21,374
W-well, we...

750
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:23,204
I don't...

751
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:26,462
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

752
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:30,331
- Her life was in your hands!
- This is our concern, Dude.

753
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,999
No, man, nothing is fucked here.

754
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,087
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.

755
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,383
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!

756
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:42,258
Come on, who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

757
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:44,475
We dropped off the damn money.

758
00:49:44,563 --> 00:49:46,472
We?

759
00:49:46,564 --> 00:49:48,604
I.

760
00:49:48,691 --> 00:49:52,391
The royal we.
You know, the editorial.

761
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:55,190
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

762
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,687
I've got certain
information, all right?

763
00:49:57,782 --> 00:50:00,486
Certain things
have come to light, and...

764
00:50:00,576 --> 00:50:03,113
Has it ever occurred to you

765
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:07,414
that instead of,
you know, running around,

766
00:50:07,498 --> 00:50:11,246
blaming me, given the nature
of all this new shit,

767
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:15,166
this could be a lot more...

768
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:17,247
Complex?

769
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:21,668
I mean, it might not be
such a simple, uh... you know?

770
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,843
What in God's name
are you blathering about?

771
00:50:24,929 --> 00:50:28,380
I'll tell you
what I'm blathering about.

772
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:31,758
I've got information.
New shit has come to light.

773
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,057
And, shit, man...

774
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:37,846
She kidnapped herself.

775
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,976
Well, sure, man.

776
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:45,068
Look at it.
A young trophy wife,

777
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:47,395
in the parlance of our times.

778
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:50,525
She owes money all over town,

779
00:50:50,616 --> 00:50:53,617
including to
known pornographers.

780
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:57,662
And that's cool. That's cool.

781
00:50:57,747 --> 00:51:00,866
I'm saying she needs money, man.

782
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,200
And... and, you know,

783
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,329
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

784
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:09,505
because she wants more, man.

785
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,923
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

786
00:51:14,553 --> 00:51:18,336
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man? Sir?

787
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,347
No, Mr Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.

788
00:51:24,436 --> 00:51:27,934
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

789
00:51:28,022 --> 00:51:31,271
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

790
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:33,564
you know. But...

791
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:36,936
Hey, that's what you pay me for.

792
00:51:38,656 --> 00:51:41,858
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could...

793
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,072
give me my 20,000 in cash?

794
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,659
My concern is... and I gotta
check with my accountant...

795
00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:50,497
but this might bump me
into a higher tax...

796
00:51:50,582 --> 00:51:52,907
Brandt... Give him the envelope.

797
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:57,128
Oh, if you've already got the
cheque made out, that's cool00Oh

798
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:59,703
We received this this morning.

799
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:04,589
Since you have
failed to achieve,

800
00:52:04,677 --> 00:52:08,092
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

801
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,927
since you have stolen my money,

802
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:15,182
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

803
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:17,060
I have no choice

804
00:52:17,145 --> 00:52:22,139
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary

805
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:27,226
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

806
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,902
With Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this:

807
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:35,485
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

808
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:39,076
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

809
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:46,622
By God, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

810
00:52:51,924 --> 00:52:54,758
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

811
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:58,756
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?

812
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,419
Nothing about it indicates...

813
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:04,005
- The nail polish, Walter.
- Fine, Dude.

814
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,179
You can get nail polish and
apply it to someone else's toe.

815
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,262
Where the fuck
are they gonna get...

816
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:13,356
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

817
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,599
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

818
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,851
You don't wanna know about it.

819
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,811
I can get you a toe
by 3 pm, with nail polish.

820
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:24,907
These fuckin' amateurs.
They send us a toe,

821
00:53:24,992 --> 00:53:28,574
we're supposed to shit ourselves
with fear. Jesus Christ!

822
00:53:28,662 --> 00:53:31,745
They're gonna kill her
and then me.

823
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:35,199
Dude... that's...

824
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:38,209
That's just
the stress talking, man.

825
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:40,501
We have what appears to me

826
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:43,257
to be a series
of victimless crimes.

827
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:47,669
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!

828
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:50,963
Could you keep your voices down?
This is a family restaurant.

829
00:53:51,055 --> 00:53:53,296
Dear, for your information,

830
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,841
the Supreme Court
has rejected prior restraint!

831
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:58,726
This is not
a First Amendment thing.

832
00:53:58,811 --> 00:54:01,977
If you don't calm down,
you'll have to leave.

833
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:05,349
Lady, my buddies died
face-down in the muck

834
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:08,395
so we could enjoy
this family restaurant!

835
00:54:08,486 --> 00:54:11,237
- I'm outta here.
- Dude, don't go away, man.

836
00:54:11,321 --> 00:54:13,195
This affects all of us.

837
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:15,108
There are basic freedoms!

838
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,992
I'm stayin'.

839
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:25,323
I'm finishing my coffee.

840
00:54:30,545 --> 00:54:33,214
Enjoying my coffee.

841
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,346
'The Dude is not in.

842
00:54:51,437 --> 00:54:54,391
'Leave a message after the beep.
Thanks, man.'

843
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:59,226
'Mr Lebowski, this is duty
officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.

844
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:01,560
'We've recovered
your automobile.

845
00:55:01,654 --> 00:55:03,693
'It can be claimed at... '

846
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:06,615
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

847
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,874
Hey! This is
a private residence, man.

848
00:55:28,634 --> 00:55:30,959
Ah, nice marmot.

849
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:45,099
Vere is the money, Lebowski.
Ve vant the money, Lebowski.

850
00:55:49,943 --> 00:55:54,154
You zink ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?

851
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,990
Things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski.

852
00:55:57,074 --> 00:55:59,909
Ve believes in nossing,
Lebowski, nossing.

853
00:55:59,993 --> 00:56:02,863
Ve come back
and ve cut off your chonson.

854
00:56:02,954 --> 00:56:04,448
Excuse me?

855
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:07,492
I said we'll
cut off your johnson!

856
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,492
Just think about that, Lebowski.

857
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:11,493
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

858
00:56:11,586 --> 00:56:14,373
Maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

859
00:56:23,804 --> 00:56:25,713
It was discovered last night

860
00:56:25,806 --> 00:56:29,008
- lodged against an abutment.
- Oh, man, lodged where?

861
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,266
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr Lebowski.

862
00:56:32,353 --> 00:56:34,226
A joyride situation.

863
00:56:34,313 --> 00:56:37,183
They abandon the vehicle
once they hit the wall.

864
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:40,642
My fucking briefcase!
Man, it's not here. Shit!

865
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:42,478
I saw the report. Sorry.

866
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:45,060
You gotta get in
on the other side.

867
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:49,697
The side-view was found
on the road by the car.

868
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:53,650
You're lucky they left the
tape deck, and the Creedence.

869
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:57,279
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

870
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,208
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

871
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,368
or just used it as a toilet.

872
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,785
Hey, man...

873
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,833
Are you gonna find
these guys, you know...

874
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:11,173
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

875
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,379
Leads? Yeah, sure.

876
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:18,514
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

877
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,932
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

878
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:24,425
They got us working in shifts.

879
00:57:29,274 --> 00:57:31,266
Leads?

880
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,435
I hope the big Lebowski kills me

881
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:36,943
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

882
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:40,816
That is just ridiculous, Dude.
No one'll cut your dick off.

883
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:43,820
- Thank you.
- Not if I have anything to say.

884
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:46,484
- That makes me feel secure.
- Dude.

885
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,415
- It makes me feel warm inside.
- Now, Dude.

886
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,740
This whole fuckin' thing.

887
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:56,294
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.

888
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,333
- But, no, man, I gotta...
- Fucking Germans.

889
00:57:59,424 --> 00:58:02,459
Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.

890
00:58:02,551 --> 00:58:04,876
They were Nazis, Dude?

891
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:08,089
Come on, Donny, they
were threatening castration.

892
00:58:08,181 --> 00:58:10,220
- Are we gonna split hairs?
- No.

893
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:12,300
- Am I wrong?
- Well, he...

894
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:14,052
They were nihilists, man.

895
00:58:14,144 --> 00:58:16,599
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

896
00:58:16,688 --> 00:58:19,357
Nihilists.

897
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,931
Fuck me.

898
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:26,482
Say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism,

899
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:28,777
at least it's an ethos.

900
00:58:28,864 --> 00:58:31,616
And also,
let's not forget, Dude,

901
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,151
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent

902
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,913
for, you know, domestic...

903
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:39,954
within the city...

904
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,997
That ain't legal either.

905
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,333
- Are you a fucking park ranger?
- No, I'm just...

906
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:48,455
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

907
00:58:48,547 --> 00:58:51,797
- We are sympathising, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.

908
00:58:51,883 --> 00:58:55,927
I don't need your fucking
sympathy. I need my johnson.

909
00:58:56,011 --> 00:58:59,380
- What do you need that for?
- You've got to buck up!

910
00:58:59,473 --> 00:59:02,923
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

911
00:59:03,017 --> 00:59:06,101
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

912
00:59:06,186 --> 00:59:09,140
Fuck the tournament?

913
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:13,097
OK, Dude. I can see you
don't want to be cheered up.

914
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:16,525
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

915
00:59:20,114 --> 00:59:23,447
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.

916
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:27,699
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

917
00:59:27,787 --> 00:59:29,863
That's right, Dude.

918
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:55,052
Do you have a good Sarsaparilla?

919
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:57,135
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

920
00:59:57,228 --> 00:59:59,718
Yeah. That's a good one.

921
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:03,771
How you doin' there, Dude?

922
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:06,767
Not too good, man.

923
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:10,692
- One of those days, huh?
- Yeah.

924
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:12,405
Well...

925
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,360
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

926
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:18,736
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and..."

927
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:21,035
Much obliged.

928
01:00:21,122 --> 01:00:23,660
"And sometimes the bar, well...

929
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:25,540
"he eats you."

930
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:28,959
That some kind of Eastern thing?

931
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:31,835
Far from it.

932
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:39,966
I like your style, Dude.

933
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,426
Hmm. Well...

934
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,840
I dig your style, too, man.

935
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,424
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

936
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,646
Thankee.

937
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:56,598
- There's just one thing, Dude.
- What's that?

938
01:00:56,693 --> 01:01:00,061
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

939
01:01:01,864 --> 01:01:04,485
What the fuck
are you talking about?

940
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:09,820
OK, Dude, have it your way.

941
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,570
Take her easy, Dude.

942
01:01:13,665 --> 01:01:16,072
Yeah. Thanks, man.

943
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:23,496
Call for you, Dude.

944
01:01:26,926 --> 01:01:28,206
Hello?

945
01:01:28,302 --> 01:01:31,338
'Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.'

946
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,632
Uh, oh, yeah.
No... no, I haven't yet.

947
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,297
'I'd like to
see you immediately.'

948
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,017
Oh?

949
01:01:50,028 --> 01:01:54,654
- So you're Lebowski.
- Yeah.

950
01:01:57,284 --> 01:01:59,323
Maude has told me all about you.

951
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:02,577
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

952
01:02:02,663 --> 01:02:06,032
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, sure. White Russian.

953
01:02:06,124 --> 01:02:08,662
The bar's over there.

954
01:02:12,922 --> 01:02:17,168
- So what do you do, Lebowski?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

955
01:02:18,926 --> 01:02:20,800
Just a friend of Maudie's.

956
01:02:20,886 --> 01:02:23,009
The friend
with the cleft asshole?

957
01:02:25,182 --> 01:02:27,719
What do you do?

958
01:02:27,809 --> 01:02:29,848
Oh, nothing much.

959
01:02:29,935 --> 01:02:31,975
Hello, Jeffrey.

960
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:35,347
Yeah, how are you?
Listen, Maude,

961
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,013
I got to, uh...

962
01:02:39,401 --> 01:02:41,477
tender my resignation
or whatever.

963
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:46,812
It looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.

964
01:02:46,908 --> 01:02:48,699
She most certainly was not.

965
01:02:48,784 --> 01:02:51,868
Hey, man,
why don't you fucking...

966
01:02:51,953 --> 01:02:55,156
listen occasionally?
You might learn something.

967
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:58,118
- Now, I got...
- Don't call her my mother.

968
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,916
She's the perpetrator
and not the victim.

969
01:03:02,003 --> 01:03:04,873
I got pretty
definitive evidence...

970
01:03:04,964 --> 01:03:07,917
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.

971
01:03:08,008 --> 01:03:11,044
Uli Kunke Her co-star
in the beaver picture?

972
01:03:11,136 --> 01:03:13,922
Beaver? You mean vagina...

973
01:03:14,013 --> 01:03:16,338
I mean, you know the guy?

974
01:03:16,432 --> 01:03:19,432
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

975
01:03:19,517 --> 01:03:21,510
Do you remember Uli?

976
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:25,018
He's a musician.
Used to have a group, Autobahn.

977
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:28,390
They released
one album in the late 70s.

978
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:31,649
Their music is
sort of a... technopop.

979
01:03:31,736 --> 01:03:34,143
So he's pretending
to be the abductor?

980
01:03:34,238 --> 01:03:36,444
- Well, yeah.
- Look, Jeffrey,

981
01:03:36,531 --> 01:03:39,200
you don't kidnap someone
you're acquainted with.

982
01:03:39,284 --> 01:03:41,821
The idea is that the hostage
can't identify you

983
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:44,448
- after you've let them go.
- I know that.

984
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,166
What the fuck
is with this guy? Who is he?

985
01:03:52,252 --> 01:03:55,787
Knox Harrington.
The video artist.

986
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,498
- So Uli has the money?
- Well...

987
01:03:59,592 --> 01:04:02,047
No, not exactly...

988
01:04:02,135 --> 01:04:04,922
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

989
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:08,630
A lot of ins and outs
and what-have-yous...

990
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:11,808
A lot of strands
to keep in my head.

991
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:14,265
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

992
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:15,812
Then who has the money?

993
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:18,767
It's Sandra, about the Biennale.

994
01:04:18,857 --> 01:04:22,356
I have to take this. Do you
have that doctor's number?

995
01:04:22,444 --> 01:04:25,894
- It's not bruised any more.
- Please, Jeffrey,

996
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:29,736
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed after-effects.

997
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,568
After-effects?

998
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:06,100
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr Lebowski, please?

999
01:05:06,188 --> 01:05:09,022
No, man. She hit me right here.

1000
01:05:09,107 --> 01:05:10,850
I understand.

1001
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:14,606
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1002
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,392
He lives in North Hollywood,

1003
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:49,561
on Radford,
near the In 'n' Out Burger.

1004
01:07:49,654 --> 01:07:51,480
The In 'n' Out Burger's
on Camrose.

1005
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:53,814
- Near it.
- Those are good burgers.

1006
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,734
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1007
01:07:55,826 --> 01:07:58,779
The kid's in ninth grade,
and his father...

1008
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:02,949
Are you ready for this? His
father is Arthur Digby Sellers.

1009
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,866
Who the fuck is that?

1010
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:07,495
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

1011
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:10,835
Ever heard of a show
called "Branded"?

1012
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:14,206
"All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek"?

1013
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,422
I know the fucking show.
So what?

1014
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,376
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1015
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:23,092
The bulk of the series.

1016
01:08:23,181 --> 01:08:25,719
- Not exactly a lightweight.
- No.

1017
01:08:25,808 --> 01:08:29,390
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1018
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,885
We'll go there
after the what-have-you,

1019
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,853
we'll brace the kid.

1020
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,932
We'll be near
the In 'n' Out Burger.

1021
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:38,480
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

1022
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:42,400
We'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

1023
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:44,695
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back...

1024
01:08:44,782 --> 01:08:46,739
If he hasn't spent it already.

1025
01:08:46,825 --> 01:08:48,782
A million fucking clams.

1026
01:08:48,869 --> 01:08:52,202
- Yes, we'll be near the, uh...
- In 'n' Out.

1027
01:08:53,956 --> 01:08:56,992
Some burgers, some beers,
a few laughs.

1028
01:08:58,085 --> 01:09:02,212
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1029
01:09:13,055 --> 01:09:16,258
Oh, fuck me, man!

1030
01:09:16,349 --> 01:09:19,469
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

1031
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,051
New 'vette? Hardly, Dude.

1032
01:09:22,146 --> 01:09:25,763
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

1033
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:29,107
depending on the options.
Wait in the car, Donny.

1034
01:09:32,446 --> 01:09:35,019
- Yes?
- Pilar?

1035
01:09:35,865 --> 01:09:37,774
My name is Walter Sobchak.

1036
01:09:37,867 --> 01:09:40,903
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

1037
01:09:40,994 --> 01:09:44,944
We came to talk about
little Larry. May we come in?

1038
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:47,197
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

1039
01:09:51,545 --> 01:09:53,952
That's him, Dude.

1040
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:03,928
And a good day to you, sir!

1041
01:10:04,013 --> 01:10:06,385
Sit down, please.

1042
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:13,687
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

1043
01:10:13,771 --> 01:10:17,186
Is he... Does he still write?

1044
01:10:17,274 --> 01:10:20,358
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

1045
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:26,438
Sir, I just want to say

1046
01:10:26,532 --> 01:10:29,982
that we're both,
on a personal level,

1047
01:10:30,076 --> 01:10:32,068
really enormous fans.

1048
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:35,197
"Branded", especially
the early episodes,

1049
01:10:35,289 --> 01:10:37,696
was truly a source
of inspiration...

1050
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:40,364
Sweetie, sit down!
This is the police.

1051
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:44,042
Oh, no, ma'am,
we are not exactly the police.

1052
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:46,620
We hope it won't
be necessary to call the police.

1053
01:10:46,715 --> 01:10:49,383
But that's up
to little Larry here.

1054
01:10:49,467 --> 01:10:51,792
Isn't it, Larry?

1055
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:03,802
Is this your homework, Larry?

1056
01:11:06,314 --> 01:11:08,353
- Is this your homework?
- Look, man...

1057
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:11,809
Dude, please.
Is this your homework, Larry?

1058
01:11:11,902 --> 01:11:13,693
Just ask him about the car.

1059
01:11:13,778 --> 01:11:16,862
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- Is that your car out front?

1060
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:20,150
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- We know it's his homework!

1061
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,819
Where's the fucking money?

1062
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,949
Look, Larry...

1063
01:11:24,037 --> 01:11:25,696
Have you heard of Vietnam?

1064
01:11:25,788 --> 01:11:28,788
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

1065
01:11:28,874 --> 01:11:30,831
We know that you stole the car.

1066
01:11:30,917 --> 01:11:32,956
- And the fucking money!
- And the fucking money.

1067
01:11:33,044 --> 01:11:35,167
We know that this
is your homework.

1068
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:38,254
- We'll cut your dick off.
- You're killing your father.

1069
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,670
All right. This is pointless.

1070
01:11:43,761 --> 01:11:46,631
OK? It's time for plan B.

1071
01:11:49,182 --> 01:11:53,049
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1072
01:11:53,144 --> 01:11:54,970
Son, this is what happens

1073
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:57,303
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

1074
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,647
Little language problem here.

1075
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:04,102
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

1076
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,937
Walter!

1077
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:08,021
What... what are you doing, man?

1078
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,277
What are you doing?

1079
01:12:13,911 --> 01:12:17,409
Here you go, Larry.
You see what happens?

1080
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:20,034
You see what happens, Larry?

1081
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,244
This is what happens

1082
01:12:24,336 --> 01:12:27,538
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

1083
01:12:28,631 --> 01:12:30,504
This is what happens, Larry!

1084
01:12:30,591 --> 01:12:32,879
You see what happens, Larry,

1085
01:12:32,968 --> 01:12:35,458
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1086
01:12:35,553 --> 01:12:37,130
This is what happens.

1087
01:12:37,221 --> 01:12:39,012
You see what happens, Larry?

1088
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,299
You see what happens, Larry?

1089
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:44,052
Do you see what happens, Larry,

1090
01:12:44,143 --> 01:12:46,432
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1091
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:50,854
This is what happens, Larry!
This is what happens, Larry!

1092
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:53,182
- No!
- This is what happens, Larry!

1093
01:12:53,276 --> 01:12:55,980
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

1094
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:58,311
What the fuck
are you doing? Stop it!

1095
01:12:58,405 --> 01:13:00,943
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1096
01:13:01,032 --> 01:13:04,151
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1097
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:06,615
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

1098
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:09,276
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1099
01:13:09,372 --> 01:13:11,080
No! That's not his... hey!

1100
01:13:11,165 --> 01:13:13,952
- God damn it!
- No! Oh, no!

1101
01:13:14,043 --> 01:13:16,996
Fuck you! You like that?

1102
01:13:17,087 --> 01:13:20,253
Fuck you!
I kill your fucking car!

1103
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,673
I kill your fucking car!

1104
01:13:43,734 --> 01:13:45,892
I accept your apology.

1105
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:51,895
No. I just... want to
handle it by myself from now on.

1106
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,362
No, no, no.

1107
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:57,202
That has nothing to do with it.

1108
01:13:57,286 --> 01:13:59,824
Yes, the car made it home.

1109
01:13:59,913 --> 01:14:02,321
You're calling me at home.

1110
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:08,038
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack.

1111
01:14:09,671 --> 01:14:12,079
Well, that's your perception.

1112
01:14:13,299 --> 01:14:15,920
You know, Walter, you're right.

1113
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:19,010
There is an unspoken message
here. It's "Fuck you"!

1114
01:14:19,096 --> 01:14:21,218
Leave me the fuck alone!

1115
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:25,804
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1116
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:46,859
Pin your diapers on. Jackie
Treehorn wants to see you.

1117
01:14:46,952 --> 01:14:50,035
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

1118
01:14:50,121 --> 01:14:52,790
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

1119
01:14:52,873 --> 01:14:54,747
You're not dealing with morons.

1120
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:45,455
Hello, Dude. Thanks for coming.

1121
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,617
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1122
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,039
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1123
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,538
Completely unspoiled.

1124
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:58,752
- What's your drink, Dude?
- White Russian. Thanks.

1125
01:15:58,844 --> 01:16:00,752
White Russian.

1126
01:16:00,845 --> 01:16:03,336
How's the smut business, Jackie?

1127
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:05,138
I wouldn't know, Dude.

1128
01:16:05,224 --> 01:16:07,975
I deal in publishing,

1129
01:16:08,059 --> 01:16:10,265
entertainment,
political advocacy.

1130
01:16:10,353 --> 01:16:13,970
- Oh. Which one's "Logjammin'"?
- Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1131
01:16:14,064 --> 01:16:17,148
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1132
01:16:17,234 --> 01:16:19,107
It's video, Dude.

1133
01:16:19,193 --> 01:16:21,731
Now that we're
competing with amateurs,

1134
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:24,655
we can't afford to invest
in extras, like story,

1135
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,028
production value,

1136
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:29,192
feelings.

1137
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:32,367
You know, people forget

1138
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:36,154
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

1139
01:16:36,249 --> 01:16:38,241
On you maybe.

1140
01:16:38,334 --> 01:16:40,410
You have to take
the good with the bad.

1141
01:16:40,502 --> 01:16:43,419
New technology permits us
to do exciting things

1142
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:47,751
in interactive erotic software.
Wave of the future, Dude.

1143
01:16:47,842 --> 01:16:50,297
100% electronic.

1144
01:16:50,385 --> 01:16:54,085
Well...
I still jerk off manually.

1145
01:16:55,473 --> 01:16:56,967
Of course you do.

1146
01:16:57,058 --> 01:17:00,640
I can see you're anxious
for me to get to the point.

1147
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:02,518
Well, here it is, Dude.

1148
01:17:02,604 --> 01:17:04,561
Where's Bunny?

1149
01:17:04,647 --> 01:17:07,897
- I thought you might know that.
- Why would I?

1150
01:17:07,983 --> 01:17:11,932
She ran off to get away from
that sizeable debt to me.

1151
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:14,649
She didn't run off.
She's been...

1152
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:16,612
I've heard that story.

1153
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:20,031
I know you're
mixed up in this, Dude.

1154
01:17:20,118 --> 01:17:23,700
I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1155
01:17:23,788 --> 01:17:25,579
That's your business.

1156
01:17:25,664 --> 01:17:27,656
All I'm saying is...

1157
01:17:27,749 --> 01:17:30,074
- I want mine.
- Yeah, right, man.

1158
01:17:30,168 --> 01:17:32,919
There are a lot of...
facets to this,

1159
01:17:33,004 --> 01:17:35,874
a lot of interested parties.

1160
01:17:35,964 --> 01:17:38,585
Excuse me.

1161
01:17:43,804 --> 01:17:45,381
Yeah?

1162
01:17:45,472 --> 01:17:46,847
Oh, yeah.

1163
01:17:46,932 --> 01:17:48,509
Where's that?

1164
01:17:51,435 --> 01:17:53,344
All right.

1165
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,731
Excuse me.

1166
01:18:33,678 --> 01:18:37,260
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.

1167
01:18:37,348 --> 01:18:39,387
So, uh...

1168
01:18:39,474 --> 01:18:42,558
If I, uh, can find your money...

1169
01:18:42,643 --> 01:18:46,226
What's in it for the Dude?

1170
01:18:46,313 --> 01:18:48,886
Of course, there's that
to discuss. Refil

1171
01:18:48,982 --> 01:18:50,808
The Pope shit in the woods?

1172
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,521
10% finder's fee.
That all right?

1173
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:56,280
OK. Done, Jackie.

1174
01:18:56,363 --> 01:18:58,735
I dig the way
you do business, man.

1175
01:18:58,823 --> 01:19:03,116
Your money is being held
by a kid named Larry Sellers.

1176
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:06,238
He lives in North Hollywood,
on Radford, uh...

1177
01:19:06,329 --> 01:19:09,116
by the In 'n' Out Burger.

1178
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:11,448
A fuckin' brat,

1179
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:13,451
but I'm sure
you can get it off him.

1180
01:19:13,544 --> 01:19:16,081
I mean, he's 15.

1181
01:19:17,088 --> 01:19:19,543
Flunking social studies.

1182
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:25,001
So, if you could just, uh...

1183
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:30,005
write me a cheque
for my 10% of half a million...

1184
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:33,016
five grand...
I'll go out and mingle.

1185
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:41,020
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

1186
01:19:41,191 --> 01:19:43,397
A 15-year-old kid.

1187
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:47,070
Is this some sort of a joke?

1188
01:19:47,154 --> 01:19:49,147
No, no joke.

1189
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:52,904
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

1190
01:19:52,992 --> 01:19:55,150
Hi, fellas.

1191
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,992
The kid just wanted a car.

1192
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:05,782
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1193
01:20:05,878 --> 01:20:07,206
I'm not greedy.

1194
01:20:09,339 --> 01:20:11,664
It really...

1195
01:20:11,758 --> 01:20:13,465
tied the room together.

1196
01:20:16,428 --> 01:20:20,093
Darkness washed over the Dude.

1197
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:22,802
Darker than
a black steer's tookus

1198
01:20:22,892 --> 01:20:26,058
on a moonless prairie night.

1199
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:28,475
There was no bottom.

1200
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:22,577
Branded!

1201
01:24:36,348 --> 01:24:39,017
Is this your only I. D?

1202
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,342
I know my rights, man.

1203
01:24:43,854 --> 01:24:47,981
- You don't know shit, Lebowski.
- I want a fucking lawyer, man.

1204
01:24:48,066 --> 01:24:52,110
I want... Bill Kunstler, man...

1205
01:24:53,278 --> 01:24:54,986
or Ron Coobie.

1206
01:24:55,071 --> 01:24:56,815
Mr Treehorn tells us

1207
01:24:56,906 --> 01:25:01,069
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

1208
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,152
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1209
01:25:03,245 --> 01:25:08,487
Mr Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1210
01:25:08,582 --> 01:25:11,785
Mr Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1211
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:14,202
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1212
01:25:14,295 --> 01:25:17,628
We got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1213
01:25:17,715 --> 01:25:20,040
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1214
01:25:20,134 --> 01:25:22,209
So let me make something plain.

1215
01:25:22,302 --> 01:25:24,839
I don't like you sucking around,

1216
01:25:24,929 --> 01:25:26,921
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

1217
01:25:27,014 --> 01:25:29,505
I don't like your jerk-off name,

1218
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,391
I don't like your jerk-off face,

1219
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:33,931
I don't like
your jerk-off behaviour,

1220
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,139
and I don't like you... Jerk-off.

1221
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:41,642
Do I make myself clear?

1222
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:46,942
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1223
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:51,572
Fucking fascist!

1224
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:55,495
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

1225
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:57,951
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

1226
01:25:59,582 --> 01:26:03,745
Keep your ugly goldbricking ass
out of my beach community.

1227
01:26:16,054 --> 01:26:19,672
Jesus... Man, could you
change the channel.

1228
01:26:19,765 --> 01:26:23,264
If you don't like my music,
get your own fucking cab!

1229
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:25,842
I'll pull over
and kick your ass out.

1230
01:26:25,937 --> 01:26:29,685
I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles.

1231
01:26:38,114 --> 01:26:40,604
Out of my fucking cab!
Out! Get...

1232
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:42,857
Hey... man!

1233
01:26:42,951 --> 01:26:45,109
Man, hey!

1234
01:27:26,945 --> 01:27:30,230
Oh... Jesus.

1235
01:27:48,421 --> 01:27:50,378
Jeffrey.

1236
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:52,917
Maude?

1237
01:27:53,008 --> 01:27:54,965
Love me.

1238
01:27:56,386 --> 01:27:58,259
Uh, that's my robe.

1239
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:02,596
Tell me about yourself, Jeffrey.

1240
01:28:02,682 --> 01:28:05,054
Well, not much to tell.

1241
01:28:05,143 --> 01:28:10,100
I, um, I was one of the authors

1242
01:28:10,189 --> 01:28:12,395
of the Port Huron statement.

1243
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,439
The original
Port Huron statement.

1244
01:28:16,652 --> 01:28:20,519
Not the compromised
second draft.

1245
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:23,444
Uh, and then I, uh,

1246
01:28:23,533 --> 01:28:25,655
you ever hear of the Seattle 7?

1247
01:28:25,743 --> 01:28:29,194
That was me.

1248
01:28:29,287 --> 01:28:34,079
And, um, the six other guys.

1249
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:38,210
Um... and then,
ah, music business briefly.

1250
01:28:40,046 --> 01:28:42,750
- Yeah, a roadie for Metallica.
- Oh.

1251
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:46,623
- "Speed of Sound" tour.
- Mm-hmm.

1252
01:28:46,718 --> 01:28:49,173
Bunch of assholes.

1253
01:28:49,262 --> 01:28:51,931
Uh, and then, you know,

1254
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:54,137
a little of this,
a little of that.

1255
01:28:54,224 --> 01:28:57,640
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1256
01:28:57,727 --> 01:29:01,973
What do you do for recreation?

1257
01:29:02,064 --> 01:29:07,354
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

1258
01:29:07,443 --> 01:29:10,479
The occasional acid flashback.

1259
01:29:16,076 --> 01:29:18,862
What happened to your house?

1260
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:21,029
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1261
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:23,872
He thought I had
your father's money.

1262
01:29:23,957 --> 01:29:26,792
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1263
01:29:26,876 --> 01:29:29,449
- Cocktai
- No, thanks.

1264
01:29:29,545 --> 01:29:32,711
It's not my father's money.
It's the Foundation's.

1265
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:36,415
Why did he think you have it?
And who does?

1266
01:29:36,509 --> 01:29:39,082
Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

1267
01:29:39,178 --> 01:29:40,755
Real fucking brat.

1268
01:29:40,846 --> 01:29:45,008
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1269
01:29:45,099 --> 01:29:48,135
Lotta ins, lotta outs.
You know, fortunately,

1270
01:29:48,227 --> 01:29:50,717
I'm adhering
to a pretty strict...

1271
01:29:50,812 --> 01:29:53,978
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

1272
01:29:54,065 --> 01:29:55,856
uh, limber, you know.

1273
01:29:55,941 --> 01:29:57,980
Very close
to your father's money.

1274
01:29:58,068 --> 01:30:01,935
It's the Foundation's money.
Father doesn't have any.

1275
01:30:03,823 --> 01:30:06,492
What are you talking about?
He's loaded.

1276
01:30:06,575 --> 01:30:09,326
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

1277
01:30:09,411 --> 01:30:11,617
No, he runs stuff, uh...

1278
01:30:11,704 --> 01:30:15,119
We did let him run a company,
but he didn't do very well.

1279
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:18,207
- No, he's...
- He administers the charities,

1280
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:21,329
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1281
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,329
He has no money of his own.

1282
01:30:23,422 --> 01:30:26,873
I know how he presents himself.
Father's weakness is vanity.

1283
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:32,589
- Hence, the slut.
- Uh, do you think he, uh...

1284
01:30:33,889 --> 01:30:35,964
What is that, yoga?

1285
01:30:36,057 --> 01:30:38,548
It increases
the chances of conception.

1286
01:30:40,186 --> 01:30:42,427
- Increases?
- Well, yes.

1287
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:45,687
What did you think this
was about? Fun and games?

1288
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:48,181
I want a child.

1289
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,564
OK, yeah, OK, but let me...

1290
01:30:50,652 --> 01:30:54,021
Let me explain
something about the Dude.

1291
01:30:54,114 --> 01:30:56,900
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

1292
01:30:56,991 --> 01:31:00,905
I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see,

1293
01:31:00,994 --> 01:31:04,991
or who has any interest
in raising the child himself.

1294
01:31:05,081 --> 01:31:07,998
Oh, so that doctor...

1295
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:10,076
Exactly.

1296
01:31:10,168 --> 01:31:12,326
Now, what happened to your face?

1297
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:15,171
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as wel

1298
01:31:15,256 --> 01:31:19,123
No, uh, it was
the Chief of Police of Malibu.

1299
01:31:19,217 --> 01:31:22,799
A real reactionary.
So, your father...

1300
01:31:24,472 --> 01:31:27,674
- Yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah.
- What?

1301
01:31:27,766 --> 01:31:30,138
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

1302
01:31:30,226 --> 01:31:34,093
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

1303
01:31:35,939 --> 01:31:38,512
Jeffrey,
what are you talking about?

1304
01:31:40,193 --> 01:31:41,735
Jeffrey!

1305
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:43,895
Walter, if you're there,

1306
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:46,359
pick up the fucking phone.
Come on.

1307
01:31:46,448 --> 01:31:49,152
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

1308
01:31:49,242 --> 01:31:50,617
'Dude? '

1309
01:31:50,701 --> 01:31:54,485
I'm at my place. I need you
to come and pick me up.

1310
01:31:54,579 --> 01:31:57,070
'I can't drive, Dude,
it's Erev Shabbos.'

1311
01:31:57,165 --> 01:31:58,908
- What?
- 'Erev Shabbos.'

1312
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,325
- 'I can't drive.'
- Man!

1313
01:32:01,418 --> 01:32:04,087
'I'm not supposed
to pick up the phone

1314
01:32:04,171 --> 01:32:06,922
- 'unless it's an emergency.'
- This is a fucking emergency!

1315
01:32:07,006 --> 01:32:09,461
'That's why
I picked up the phone.'

1316
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:12,669
Walter, you fuck,
we gotta go to Pasadena.

1317
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:14,919
Pick me up
or I'm off the bowling team.

1318
01:32:31,318 --> 01:32:34,152
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

1319
01:32:34,237 --> 01:32:36,941
Get out of that fucking car!

1320
01:32:37,031 --> 01:32:39,521
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

1321
01:32:40,992 --> 01:32:43,198
Get out of the fucking...

1322
01:32:43,286 --> 01:32:45,325
Who the fuck are you, man?

1323
01:32:45,412 --> 01:32:49,279
Easy, man. Relax, man.
No physical harm intended.

1324
01:32:49,374 --> 01:32:52,410
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me around?

1325
01:32:52,502 --> 01:32:53,746
Come on, fuckhead.

1326
01:32:53,836 --> 01:32:56,042
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

1327
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,418
Brother Seamus?

1328
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:01,044
Like an Irish monk?

1329
01:33:01,134 --> 01:33:03,802
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1330
01:33:03,886 --> 01:33:07,634
My name is Da Fino. I'm a
private snoop, like you, man.

1331
01:33:07,722 --> 01:33:10,592
- What?
- A dick, man.

1332
01:33:10,683 --> 01:33:14,051
Let me tell you something.
I dig your work.

1333
01:33:14,144 --> 01:33:16,101
Playing one side
against the other.

1334
01:33:16,188 --> 01:33:18,643
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff.

1335
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:20,190
I'm not! Fuck it.

1336
01:33:20,274 --> 01:33:23,025
Just stay away
from my lady friend.

1337
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:25,600
I'm not messing
with your special lady.

1338
01:33:25,695 --> 01:33:27,569
She's not my special lady.

1339
01:33:27,655 --> 01:33:29,731
I'm just helping her conceive.

1340
01:33:29,824 --> 01:33:32,231
- I'm not...
- Who are you working for?

1341
01:33:32,326 --> 01:33:35,741
Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?

1342
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:37,613
The Knutsens.

1343
01:33:37,705 --> 01:33:41,998
The... who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

1344
01:33:42,084 --> 01:33:45,582
The Knutsens.
It's a wandering-daughter job.

1345
01:33:46,546 --> 01:33:49,463
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1346
01:33:49,548 --> 01:33:52,003
Her real name is Fawn Knutsen.

1347
01:33:52,092 --> 01:33:55,341
Her parents want her back.

1348
01:33:55,428 --> 01:33:57,835
Jesus fucking Christ.

1349
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:00,088
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

1350
01:34:00,182 --> 01:34:03,965
The Knutsens told me to
show her this when I found her.

1351
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:08,104
It's the family farm
outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.

1352
01:34:08,188 --> 01:34:11,142
They think it'll
make her homesick.

1353
01:34:11,232 --> 01:34:15,478
How are you gonna keep 'em down
once they've seen Karl Hungus?

1354
01:34:15,569 --> 01:34:18,238
- She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
- Oh, man.

1355
01:34:18,321 --> 01:34:20,230
Maybe not, but she's not around.

1356
01:34:20,323 --> 01:34:24,949
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

1357
01:34:25,035 --> 01:34:29,115
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

1358
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:31,328
Compeers, you know what I mean?

1359
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:33,573
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1360
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:35,909
And stay away from my special...

1361
01:34:36,002 --> 01:34:38,837
from my fucking
lady friend, man.

1362
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,413
Ze lingonberry pancakes.

1363
01:34:47,554 --> 01:34:49,629
Lingonberry pancakes.

1364
01:34:53,308 --> 01:34:55,680
Sree pigs in blanket.

1365
01:35:01,773 --> 01:35:03,766
She has lingonberry pancakes.

1366
01:35:11,656 --> 01:35:14,112
We totally fucked it up, man.

1367
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,865
We fucked up his payoff,
we pissed off the kidnappers,

1368
01:35:17,953 --> 01:35:21,820
and Lebowski, he yelled at me
but he didn't do anything, huh?

1369
01:35:21,915 --> 01:35:24,619
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic...

1370
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:26,784
If he knows I'm a fuck-up,

1371
01:35:26,877 --> 01:35:29,794
why does he ask me
to get his wife back?

1372
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,417
Because he doesn't
want her back.

1373
01:35:32,507 --> 01:35:35,673
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

1374
01:35:35,759 --> 01:35:38,760
But then,
why doesn't he give a shit

1375
01:35:38,845 --> 01:35:40,672
about his million bucks?

1376
01:35:40,763 --> 01:35:43,764
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1377
01:35:43,849 --> 01:35:45,592
but he never asked for it back.

1378
01:35:45,684 --> 01:35:48,969
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

1379
01:35:49,062 --> 01:35:52,395
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1380
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:55,601
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1381
01:35:55,692 --> 01:35:58,444
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1382
01:35:58,528 --> 01:36:00,816
How does
this add up to an emergency?

1383
01:36:00,905 --> 01:36:02,399
Huh?

1384
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:05,062
I see what you're
getting at, Dude,

1385
01:36:05,158 --> 01:36:07,993
he kept the money.
My point is...

1386
01:36:08,077 --> 01:36:12,738
here we are, it's Shabbos,
which I'm allowed to break

1387
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:15,748
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

1388
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:18,159
Come off it.
You're not even fucking Jewish.

1389
01:36:18,252 --> 01:36:20,707
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1390
01:36:20,796 --> 01:36:22,788
You're fucking Polish-Catholic.

1391
01:36:22,881 --> 01:36:25,288
I converted when I married
Cynthia. Come on.

1392
01:36:25,383 --> 01:36:28,004
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know this.

1393
01:36:28,094 --> 01:36:30,584
Five years ago,
you were divorced.

1394
01:36:30,679 --> 01:36:33,252
So when you get divorced,
you return your library card?

1395
01:36:33,348 --> 01:36:36,052
You get a new licence?
You stop being Jewish?

1396
01:36:36,142 --> 01:36:40,009
- This is the driveway.
- I'm Jewish as fucking Tevyé.

1397
01:36:40,103 --> 01:36:43,768
Man, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

1398
01:36:43,856 --> 01:36:47,723
Taking care of her fucking dog.
Going to her fucking synagogue.

1399
01:36:47,818 --> 01:36:49,360
You're living in the past.

1400
01:36:49,444 --> 01:36:51,353
3,000 years
of beautiful tradition

1401
01:36:51,446 --> 01:36:53,319
from Moses to Sandy Koufax,

1402
01:36:53,406 --> 01:36:58,281
damn right I'm living
in the fucking past! I... Jesus.

1403
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,859
What the hell happened?

1404
01:37:20,762 --> 01:37:22,505
Where was she, man?

1405
01:37:22,596 --> 01:37:24,589
Visiting friends
in Palm Springs.

1406
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:26,887
She just left.
Never bothered to tell us.

1407
01:37:26,975 --> 01:37:29,726
I guess the nihilist
knew where she was.

1408
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:31,602
She never
even kidnapped herself.

1409
01:37:31,687 --> 01:37:35,636
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am I? A fucking veteran.

1410
01:37:35,732 --> 01:37:38,483
You shouldn't go in, Dude.
He's very angry.

1411
01:37:41,278 --> 01:37:43,317
So, man...

1412
01:37:43,405 --> 01:37:46,939
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

1413
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:49,903
- Where's the fucking money?
- A million bucks

1414
01:37:49,994 --> 01:37:53,907
from fucking needy little
urban achievers! You are scum!

1415
01:37:53,997 --> 01:37:56,369
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am I?

1416
01:37:56,457 --> 01:37:59,742
I'm the guy that's gonna kick
your goldbricking ass!

1417
01:37:59,835 --> 01:38:03,535
The briefcase was empty.
You kept the money for yourself.

1418
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:05,622
You have your story,
I have mine.

1419
01:38:05,715 --> 01:38:08,466
I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.

1420
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:11,966
As if we would ever
take your bullshit money!

1421
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:15,718
You thought Bunny had been
kidnapped, and you were glad.

1422
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:18,048
You could make
some money disappear.

1423
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,810
You needed was a sap
to pin it on.

1424
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:24,760
You just met me.
You... human paraquat!

1425
01:38:24,855 --> 01:38:27,061
You figured,
"Oh, here's a loser."

1426
01:38:27,149 --> 01:38:30,482
Somebody the square community
won't give a shit about.

1427
01:38:30,568 --> 01:38:34,945
- Well, aren't you?
- Well, yeah, but...

1428
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,698
Get out, both of you.

1429
01:38:37,783 --> 01:38:41,198
Look at that phony.
Pretending to be a millionaire.

1430
01:38:41,285 --> 01:38:43,194
Out of this house now, you bums!

1431
01:38:43,287 --> 01:38:44,995
Let me tell you something.

1432
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,452
I've seen
a lot of spinals, Dude,

1433
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:51,039
and this guy's a fake.
A fucking goldbricker.

1434
01:38:51,127 --> 01:38:54,412
- Stay away from me!
- This guy fucking walks.

1435
01:38:54,504 --> 01:38:57,458
- I've never been more certain.
- Stay away!

1436
01:38:57,549 --> 01:39:00,882
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man, he's a cripple.

1437
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,877
Get away from me!

1438
01:39:04,721 --> 01:39:08,006
- Put him down, man!
- Yeah, I'll put him down!

1439
01:39:08,099 --> 01:39:10,221
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

1440
01:39:26,405 --> 01:39:29,655
Come on, help me
put him back in his chair.

1441
01:39:49,716 --> 01:39:52,088
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

1442
01:39:52,176 --> 01:39:54,881
Fighting in desert
is very different

1443
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:59,050
from fighting in jungle.
'Nam was a foot soldier's war,

1444
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:03,220
whereas this thing should,
you know, be a piece of cake.

1445
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:07,142
I mean, I had an M16 Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1446
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,637
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

1447
01:40:09,732 --> 01:40:12,484
- Yeah.
- That's fuckin' combat.

1448
01:40:12,568 --> 01:40:15,237
The man in
the black pyjamas, Dude.

1449
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,727
Worthy fuckin' adversary.

1450
01:40:17,822 --> 01:40:21,356
- Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1451
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,407
Whereas, what we have here...

1452
01:40:23,494 --> 01:40:25,949
Fig-eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

1453
01:40:26,037 --> 01:40:28,326
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1454
01:40:28,414 --> 01:40:30,703
- This... this is not a worthy...
- Hey!

1455
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:33,116
What's this day-of-rest shit?

1456
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:36,163
What's this bullshit?!
I don't fuckin' care!

1457
01:40:36,254 --> 01:40:39,918
It don't matter to Jesus.
But you not fooling me, man.

1458
01:40:40,007 --> 01:40:42,213
You might fool
the league office,

1459
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,838
but you don't fool Jesus.

1460
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,549
It's bush league
psyche-out stuff.

1461
01:40:47,638 --> 01:40:50,010
Laughable, man.

1462
01:40:50,099 --> 01:40:53,348
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1463
01:40:53,435 --> 01:40:57,432
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1464
01:40:57,521 --> 01:41:01,649
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

1465
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:07,310
He's cracking.

1466
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,321
The whole concept of Asia.

1467
01:41:09,406 --> 01:41:11,647
Many learned men
have disputed this,

1468
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:14,991
but in the 14th Century,
the Rabahm, he...

1469
01:41:23,751 --> 01:41:26,039
Well, they finally did it.

1470
01:41:26,128 --> 01:41:28,334
They killed my fucking car.

1471
01:41:28,421 --> 01:41:32,205
We want ze money, Lebowski.

1472
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,541
Ja, otherwise, we kill ze girl.

1473
01:41:34,635 --> 01:41:38,133
Ja, it seems you have
forgotten our little deal.

1474
01:41:38,221 --> 01:41:41,056
You don't have
the fucking girl, dipshit.

1475
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:43,809
< We know you never did.

1476
01:41:43,892 --> 01:41:45,552
Are these the Nazis?

1477
01:41:45,644 --> 01:41:47,850
No, nihilists.
Nothing to be afraid of.

1478
01:41:49,772 --> 01:41:53,354
Ve don't care. Ve still
want the money, Lebowski,

1479
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:55,600
or we'll fuck you up.

1480
01:41:55,694 --> 01:41:58,398
Fuck you.
Fuck the three of yous.

1481
01:41:58,487 --> 01:42:02,105
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1482
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,401
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1483
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:07,735
His girlfriend gave up her toe.

1484
01:42:07,828 --> 01:42:10,449
She zought
we'd be getting $1 million.

1485
01:42:10,539 --> 01:42:11,784
It's not fair.

1486
01:42:11,873 --> 01:42:14,957
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here,

1487
01:42:15,043 --> 01:42:17,118
you bunch of fucking crybabies.

1488
01:42:17,211 --> 01:42:21,290
Cool it, Walter. Hey, look, pal,
there never was any money.

1489
01:42:21,381 --> 01:42:23,706
The big Lebowski
gave me an empty briefcase,

1490
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,626
so take it up with him, man.

1491
01:42:25,718 --> 01:42:28,125
I would like my undies back.

1492
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,470
- Are these guys gonna hurt us?
- No, these men are cowards.

1493
01:42:31,556 --> 01:42:34,889
OK, so we take
ze money you have on you

1494
01:42:34,975 --> 01:42:36,932
and we calls it even.

1495
01:42:37,728 --> 01:42:39,554
Fuck you.

1496
01:42:39,646 --> 01:42:43,097
No, Walter, come on.
We're ending this cheap, man.

1497
01:42:43,191 --> 01:42:46,061
- No, what's mine is mine.
- Come on, Walter.

1498
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:50,231
- No funny stuff.
- All right, I got...

1499
01:42:50,321 --> 01:42:53,275
- uh, 4 bucks, almost 5.
- I got $18.

1500
01:42:53,365 --> 01:42:55,358
What's mine is mine.

1501
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:58,071
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.

1502
01:42:58,161 --> 01:43:00,568
Come and get it.

1503
01:43:01,205 --> 01:43:03,493
We fuck you up.

1504
01:43:03,582 --> 01:43:05,539
Show me what you got, nihilist.

1505
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:07,119
I fuck you.

1506
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,787
Come on, he's got a sword.

1507
01:43:08,878 --> 01:43:10,705
Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

1508
01:43:10,796 --> 01:43:13,999
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1509
01:43:14,091 --> 01:43:15,715
I fuck you, I!

1510
01:43:21,055 --> 01:43:23,130
Take it easy, man.
Here's the $4.

1511
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,512
I got a fucking ball, man.

1512
01:43:37,234 --> 01:43:39,357
Anti-Semite!

1513
01:43:39,445 --> 01:43:41,603
I fuck you in ze ass.

1514
01:43:41,696 --> 01:43:45,195
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1515
01:43:45,283 --> 01:43:46,907
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1516
01:43:53,373 --> 01:43:55,495
We got a man down, Dude.

1517
01:43:58,919 --> 01:44:01,125
God, they shot him, man.

1518
01:44:01,212 --> 01:44:03,169
- No, Dude.
- They shot Donny?

1519
01:44:03,256 --> 01:44:06,422
There weren't any shots fired.
It's a heart attack.

1520
01:44:06,508 --> 01:44:08,880
Call the medics, Dude.

1521
01:44:08,969 --> 01:44:12,503
I'd go myself, but I'm
pumping blood. Might pass out.

1522
01:44:12,597 --> 01:44:16,214
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

1523
01:44:16,308 --> 01:44:18,466
We got help choppering in.

1524
01:44:45,206 --> 01:44:47,993
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

1525
01:44:48,084 --> 01:44:49,910
Yeah, man.

1526
01:44:50,002 --> 01:44:52,041
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

1527
01:44:52,129 --> 01:44:53,671
Jeff Lebowski.

1528
01:44:53,755 --> 01:44:55,332
Walter Sobchak.

1529
01:44:55,423 --> 01:44:58,092
The Dude, actually, is, uh...

1530
01:44:58,175 --> 01:45:00,796
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

1531
01:45:00,886 --> 01:45:06,591
Yes, I understand
you're taking away the remains.

1532
01:45:06,682 --> 01:45:08,224
Yeah.

1533
01:45:08,309 --> 01:45:10,799
We have the urn.

1534
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:14,227
I assume this is credit card.

1535
01:45:15,356 --> 01:45:16,814
Yeah.

1536
01:45:31,035 --> 01:45:33,324
What's this?

1537
01:45:33,412 --> 01:45:35,286
That's for the urn.

1538
01:45:35,372 --> 01:45:37,779
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

1539
01:45:37,874 --> 01:45:39,913
Yes, so we were informed.

1540
01:45:40,001 --> 01:45:42,373
However, we must, of course,

1541
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:45,664
transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.

1542
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:48,999
This is $180.

1543
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:53,005
It is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

1544
01:45:53,095 --> 01:45:55,550
- Can we just, uh...
- $180?

1545
01:45:55,639 --> 01:45:59,588
- They range up to 3,000.
- Uh, we're, uh, ahem...

1546
01:45:59,684 --> 01:46:01,806
Can't we just
rent it from you?

1547
01:46:01,894 --> 01:46:04,645
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

1548
01:46:04,729 --> 01:46:06,271
We're scattering the ashes!

1549
01:46:06,356 --> 01:46:09,440
Just because we're bereaved,
doesn't make us saps!

1550
01:46:09,525 --> 01:46:12,276
Sir, please, lower your voices.

1551
01:46:12,361 --> 01:46:14,400
Man, don't you have, you know,

1552
01:46:14,487 --> 01:46:18,235
something else we could
put him in, you know?

1553
01:46:18,324 --> 01:46:20,897
That is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

1554
01:46:20,993 --> 01:46:22,535
Goddamn it!

1555
01:46:24,287 --> 01:46:26,493
Is there a Ralph's around here?

1556
01:46:53,144 --> 01:46:56,844
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1557
01:46:56,939 --> 01:46:59,227
He was one of us.

1558
01:46:59,316 --> 01:47:03,644
He was a man who loved
the outdoors... and bowling.

1559
01:47:03,736 --> 01:47:05,977
As a surfer,
he explored the beaches

1560
01:47:06,071 --> 01:47:07,944
of Southern California,

1561
01:47:08,031 --> 01:47:13,237
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo
and up to Pismo.

1562
01:47:13,327 --> 01:47:18,237
He died... he died as so
many men of his generation,

1563
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:20,122
before his time.

1564
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:23,327
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

1565
01:47:23,419 --> 01:47:26,917
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

1566
01:47:27,005 --> 01:47:32,425
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,
and Hill 364.

1567
01:47:32,509 --> 01:47:34,881
These young men
gave their lives.

1568
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:37,176
So did Donny.

1569
01:47:38,931 --> 01:47:41,931
Donny who loved bowling.

1570
01:47:43,602 --> 01:47:46,175
And so...

1571
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:49,140
Theodore Donald Karabotsos,

1572
01:47:49,231 --> 01:47:53,939
in accordance
with what we think

1573
01:47:54,027 --> 01:47:56,352
your dying wishes
might well have been,

1574
01:47:56,445 --> 01:48:00,312
we commit your final,
mortal remains

1575
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:04,274
to the bosom
of the Pacific Ocean,

1576
01:48:04,368 --> 01:48:07,239
which you loved so well.

1577
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:10,996
Goodnight, sweet prince.

1578
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,466
Shit.

1579
01:48:29,264 --> 01:48:32,217
Oh, shit, Dude, I'm sorry.

1580
01:48:32,933 --> 01:48:36,468
- Goddamn wind.
- Goddamn it, Walter.

1581
01:48:36,561 --> 01:48:38,969
- You fucking asshole!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1582
01:48:39,063 --> 01:48:41,519
Everything's
a fucking travesty with you.

1583
01:48:41,607 --> 01:48:43,315
Sorry. It was an accident.

1584
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,143
What was that shit
about Vietnam?

1585
01:48:45,235 --> 01:48:48,603
What does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

1586
01:48:48,696 --> 01:48:50,523
What the fuck
were you talking about?

1587
01:48:50,614 --> 01:48:52,571
Dude, I'm sorry.

1588
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:56,692
Fuckin'...

1589
01:49:02,332 --> 01:49:04,574
Fuck, Walter.

1590
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:10,084
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

1591
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,337
Let's go bowling.

1592
01:50:09,846 --> 01:50:11,802
Two oat sodas, Gary.

1593
01:50:11,889 --> 01:50:14,344
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

1594
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:16,674
I'm sorry to hear about Donny.

1595
01:50:16,768 --> 01:50:20,136
Oh, well, yeah, you know,

1596
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:23,680
sometimes you eat the bar
and sometimes, you know...

1597
01:50:23,774 --> 01:50:25,682
Hey, man!

1598
01:50:25,775 --> 01:50:27,732
Howdy doo, Dude.

1599
01:50:27,819 --> 01:50:30,274
I wondered if I'd see you again.

1600
01:50:30,362 --> 01:50:33,778
I wouldn't miss the semis.
How have things been going?

1601
01:50:33,865 --> 01:50:36,782
Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

1602
01:50:36,868 --> 01:50:40,283
- Sure. I gotcha.
- Yeah.

1603
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:42,279
Thanks, Gary.

1604
01:50:42,372 --> 01:50:45,041
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1605
01:50:45,124 --> 01:50:47,745
- Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
- Oh, yeah.

1606
01:50:47,835 --> 01:50:49,910
I know that you will.

1607
01:50:50,003 --> 01:50:54,000
Yeah, well, the Dude abides.

1608
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:02,839
The Dude abides.

1609
01:51:05,641 --> 01:51:10,302
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1610
01:51:10,395 --> 01:51:14,392
It's good knowing
he's out there, the Dude.

1611
01:51:14,481 --> 01:51:17,565
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

1612
01:51:17,651 --> 01:51:19,809
Shoosh.

1613
01:51:19,903 --> 01:51:23,188
I sure hope he makes the finals.

1614
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:28,025
Well, that about does her.
Wraps her all up.

1615
01:51:28,118 --> 01:51:32,944
Things seem to have worked out
good for the Dude and Walter.

1616
01:51:33,038 --> 01:51:36,738
It was a pretty good story,
don't you think?

1617
01:51:36,833 --> 01:51:39,917
Made me laugh to beat the band.

1618
01:51:40,002 --> 01:51:42,291
Parts, anyway.

1619
01:51:42,379 --> 01:51:45,794
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1620
01:51:45,882 --> 01:51:48,551
But then I happen to know

1621
01:51:48,634 --> 01:51:52,133
that there's
a little Lebowski on the way.

1622
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:56,052
I guess that's how
the whole darn human comedy

1623
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:59,224
keeps perpetuating itself

1624
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:02,096
down through the generations.

1625
01:52:02,187 --> 01:52:04,179
Westward the wagons,

1626
01:52:04,272 --> 01:52:07,356
across the sands
of time until we...

1627
01:52:07,441 --> 01:52:09,480
Oh, look at me.

1628
01:52:09,568 --> 01:52:12,272
I'm ramblin' again.

1629
01:52:12,362 --> 01:52:15,031
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1630
01:52:15,114 --> 01:52:18,115
Catch ya later on
down the trail.

1631
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:22,529
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good Sarsaparilla?
