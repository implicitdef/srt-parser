1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,689
_

2
00:00:01,776 --> 00:00:03,836
So you want to talk the whole
case through or...?

3
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:05,756
The whole story from
your end, you don't mind.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,750
That's what y'all want
to hear about, right,

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,402
Dora Lange, kids in the woods?

6
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:13,631
I guarantee this
wasn't his first.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,419
So she was drugged, tortured,
posed out there.

8
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:18,644
Is it the Fontenot girl?

9
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:19,921
And why would you ask that?

10
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,581
Went missing
around here years back.

11
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:24,460
Ten-year-old girl goes missing
and that doesn't go state-wide?

12
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:26,899
My understanding, the little girl
went off with her birth daddy.

13
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:28,039
Marty?

14
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,708
I don't know what that is.

15
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:32,265
I haven't looked in there
since the police first came.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,136
Rust, it is so nice
to finally meet you.

17
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:37,236
- Children?
- One, she passed.

18
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:39,328
Marriage didn't last
long after that.

19
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:40,383
This is Reverend Tuttle.

20
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:41,719
We've been discussing
the task force

21
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:44,486
to investigate crimes with
an anti-Christian connotation.

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,243
There is a war happening.

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,374
You want to talk Dori?

24
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,276
Man, she was high.

25
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,889
Talkin' 'bout she met a king.

26
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:51,628
Can you, uh, tell us
anything about that?

27
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:52,565
You were off the grid.

28
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,345
My question is--

29
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:54,985
How could it be him...

30
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:57,246
if we already
caught him in '95?

31
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,516
How indeed, Detectives?

True Detective - 1x02
"Seeing Things"

51
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:39,067
Back then, I'd sleep and

52
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,106
I'd lay awake thinking
about women.

53
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,412
My daughter...
my wife.

54
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:48,953
I mean, it's like... something's
just got your name on it,

55
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:50,954
like a, like a bullet

56
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:54,093
or a nail in the road.

57
00:02:56,863 --> 00:02:58,334
Shit.

58
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,735
Sorry. I drift...

59
00:03:00,768 --> 00:03:04,303
sometimes when I've
had a few. That's...

60
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,804
That's why I like
to drink alone.

61
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:08,541
One reason, anyway.

62
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,179
- About that sculpture thing.
- Hmm.

63
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:15,718
Kind of strange
it turns up like that

64
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,685
years later.

65
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,622
Yeah, nobody knew why
that thing was in the playhouse.

66
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,466
I mean, the aunt reckoned
maybe it was something

67
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,635
she made in school, you know?

68
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:36,107
To me, it was like someone was

69
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,314
having a conversation,
you know?

70
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,920
Girl's... school
shut down in '92.

71
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:51,316
It closed down after Andrew.

72
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,957
That mean anything to you?

73
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:03,699
Oh, we notified
the deceased's mother.

74
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,502
Do you remember the last time

75
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:11,574
you saw your daughter Dora?

76
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:15,111
It was
a horrible, horrible thing.

77
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:18,583
We saw it on TV,

78
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:21,087
what we're in the clutches of,

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,153
and I prayed and prayed
for that woman's family.

80
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:28,289
And it's me.

81
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,633
It's me.

82
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,169
- Mrs. Kelly.
- Hmm?

83
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:36,202
What about her father?

84
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,704
Did they have a relationship?

85
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,440
Why?
What have you heard?

86
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:44,147
I heard he passed.
Is that correct?

87
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,314
Why wouldn't a father
bathe his own child?

88
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:54,523
Ahem.

89
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,583
We, uh, we were just wondering

90
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:58,222
how they got on, ma'am.

91
00:04:58,255 --> 00:04:59,959
He died on the road.

92
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,529
He drove a Peterbilt,

93
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:03,593
and he took an exit too fast.

94
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:07,599
Rolled over
near Rowan, Oklahoma.

95
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,769
May 11, 1984.

96
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,938
When was the last time
you talked to her?

97
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:16,275
You know, she's always been
in some kind of trouble.

98
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:18,816
I thought things were
getting better.

99
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,785
Got away from Charlie.

100
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:24,359
She came by not too
long ago, maybe a month.

101
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,791
She didn't talk
about her daddy none.

102
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:29,863
Said she'd been
going to church.

103
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,295
Do you, um,

104
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:33,665
do you remember where
that church was?

105
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,200
- Oh...
- Mrs. Kelly?

106
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,704
No.

107
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,408
Ow.

108
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:46,083
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

109
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:48,387
Hail Mary, full of grace.

110
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,850
Mrs. Kelly--

111
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,090
I-- I get
these headaches.

112
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:54,754
It's like storms. Oh.

113
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,796
I worked in dry-cleaning
for 20 years.

114
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,931
The chemicals.

115
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:02,396
That's what's wrong
with my nails.

116
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,242
Piece of work, huh?

117
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:15,176
My mother--
Donna Reed type.

118
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,678
Packed lunches,

119
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,814
bedtime stories.

120
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,813
Your mom still alive?

121
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:29,319
Maybe.

122
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,665
Cohle ever talk about his parents?

123
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:39,203
No.
Little bit about his dad.

124
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,276
Alaska, 'Nam.

125
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:45,777
You know, my dad, I had
about 6 inches on him,

126
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,272
and even in the end,

127
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:51,109
I still think
he could have taken me.

128
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:54,611
Yeah, Marines, Korea.

129
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:56,043
Never talked about it.

130
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,115
You know, there was a time that

131
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,619
men didn't air their
bullshit to the world.

132
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,283
You know, it just wasn't
a part of their job.

133
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,922
Well...

134
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,089
family.

135
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,561
Well, I mean, I...

136
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:14,062
I think a part
of Rust's problem was

137
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:19,061
there was things he needed
that he couldn't admit to.

138
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:22,533
Afternoon, men.

139
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:26,606
So we talked to the
victim's friend next, I believe.

140
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,542
Miss Carla?

141
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:30,542
I guess she always had her mom's place,

142
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:34,076
but, uh, I thought maybe
she'd gotten into somethin',

143
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:38,611
you know, like, uh,
like gamin' again.

144
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:41,549
Havin' a rough time.

145
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:45,591
What all did y'all talk
about? How was she?

146
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:47,794
Thin, loopy,

147
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,300
like high,

148
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,772
usually on somethin'.

149
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,838
She says she found a church,
but, uh-- heh!--

150
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,175
her eyes.

151
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,543
Somethin' wrong with 'em.

152
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,586
Now, do you remember
where this church was?

153
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,923
No.

154
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:08,258
You know where she might
have been staying?

155
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,763
Her landlord said she'd
moved out last summer.

156
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:13,028
That's when I stopped
seein' her so much.

157
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,037
She mentioned someplace
down south,

158
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,037
like around Spanish Lake, a...

159
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,444
shelter, girls used
to stay there,

160
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:24,478
something, all she said.

161
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:25,952
Hmm.

162
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:29,154
She sounds sad, Marty,

163
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:32,828
like a torn-up person
on her last legs.

164
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:37,869
She was just
an easy target for him.

165
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,901
What do we know about him?

166
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:42,866
Hits prosts, artistic,

167
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,369
religious in some kind of way.

168
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,875
Every person within
a thousand miles of here

169
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:51,071
is religious in some
kind of way, except you.

170
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,708
How many DBs have antlers,

171
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,677
blindfolds,

172
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,014
painted symbols
on their back, hmm?

173
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:00,012
Yeah, you know what
tweakers get up to.

174
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,514
Shit, man, this dude
in New Orleans

175
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,482
cut up his girl, felt remorse,

176
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:06,848
tried to piece her back
together with Krazy Glue.

177
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,885
That's just drug insanity.

178
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,380
Ah, that's not this.
This has scope.

179
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:13,886
Now, she articulated
a person with vision.

180
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,892
Vision is meaning.
Meaning is historical.

181
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,552
Look, she was just chum
in the water, man.

182
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,874
Days of nothing.

183
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:42,041
That's what it's like,
you work cases.

184
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,552
Days like lost dogs.

185
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,625
Goes on like that.

186
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:00,635
You know the job.

187
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,697
You're looking for narrative,

188
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,706
interrogate witnesses.

189
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,674
Wake up, Daddy.

190
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,705
Parcel evidence,

191
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:13,178
establish a timeline,

192
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:17,113
and build a story
day after day.

193
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,617
No! No!

194
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,734
Hey, the other night,

195
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,240
when you were over for dinner,

196
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,407
why didn't you leave
when I had Chris call?

197
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:51,250
Mmm, I don't know.

198
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,419
I guess I had
sobered up a little.

199
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:59,258
Besides, it wasn't
as bad as I thought.

200
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,394
And being around your family,

201
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,359
I liked talking to them.

202
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:06,929
"Bad"?
Why'd you think that?

203
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:13,801
I was married, Marty,
for 3 years.

204
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:16,306
We had a... baby girl.

205
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,277
She died.

206
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,283
Car accident.
She was two years old.

207
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:24,449
Marriage couldn't handle it.

208
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:28,651
Your kid died?

209
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,591
Oh, I...

210
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:38,297
I'm sorry, man. I am so sorry.
I didn't--

211
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,467
No, I mean, it wasn't
you guys. It was just me.

212
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,309
I was worried...

213
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:49,779
you know, being around
that kind of thing.

214
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:52,810
Hey, you were
married the once, just the once?

215
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:55,849
Uh-huh.
Came close another time.

216
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,985
Laurie.

217
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:05,345
Maggie introduced us,

218
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:07,788
and it-- it broke off.

219
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:11,493
It was for the best, you know.
I gave her cause.

220
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,763
I can be hard to live
with. You know, I...

221
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:21,128
I don't mean to,
but I can be... critical.

222
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,495
And sometimes I think I'm
just not good for people,

223
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:29,038
you know, that it's not good
for them to be around me.

224
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:33,067
You know, I...
I wear 'em down,

225
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,539
you know, they...

226
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:38,210
- they get unhappy.
- Hmm.

227
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:42,579
Yeah, I think the job does
that to a lot of guys.

228
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:46,052
Changes you. Some guys
just notice, that's all.

229
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:49,452
Well I can't say the
job made me this way.

230
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:53,495
More like me being this way
made me right for the job.

231
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,495
And I used to...

232
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:59,432
think about it more, but...

233
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:03,977
you know, you reach a certain
age, you know who you are.

234
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,981
Now I live in a little room

235
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:09,981
out in the country,
behind a bar.

236
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,988
Work 4 nights a week;
in between, I drink,

237
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:17,661
and there ain't
nobody there to stop me.

238
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:22,665
I know who I am.

239
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:28,038
After all these years,
there's a...

240
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,505
there's a victory in that.

241
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,017
Third day on the job,

242
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:37,221
stopped this cutie
for speeding.

243
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:40,224
52 minutes later,
back in her dorm room.

244
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:42,559
I got my...

245
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:45,062
uniform around my knees.

246
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,537
Ha! I'm occupied,

247
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,539
so I don't hear anything.

248
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:54,346
I don't know that her
roommate has come home

249
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:57,378
- and snuck up behind us.
- Oh, shit.

250
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:59,880
You know how I knew that
she was in the room?

251
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,818
She stuck her finger up my ass!

252
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,518
Ruined me. Now I can't
do without it.

253
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:14,389
You miss some things on the job.

254
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,428
You know what I mean.

255
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,859
You got to... decompress

256
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:23,132
before you can go being
a family man.

257
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:25,605
What you get into working,

258
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,769
you can't have
the kids around that.

259
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:35,042
So, um, sometimes you got
to get your head right.

260
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,516
Mind if I stop by?

261
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,580
I don't know. Where are you?

262
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,053
Elks.

263
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:43,056
So you're drunk.

264
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:44,528
No, I'm not,

265
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:47,025
and I've hardly had
anything to drink.

266
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:50,200
You never hardly have
anything to drink.

267
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:54,066
I have a surprise for you.

268
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:55,507
Oh, yeah?

269
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,509
Yeah.

270
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:00,014
Is that a yes?

271
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,518
I, uh, might stay up.

272
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,015
Ah.

273
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:09,959
It's for
your wife and kids, too.

274
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,956
You got to take your release
where you find it

275
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,426
or where it finds you.

276
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,099
I mean, in the end, it's for
the good of the family.

277
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,814
What's that?

278
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,750
Oh, well, I, uh,

279
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:48,792
got you a present.

280
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,306
Don't move a muscle.

281
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:09,842
I shan't.
Just the fingers.

282
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:12,852
The finger muscles.

283
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:15,156
Mmm.

284
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:17,790
Oh, stop.

285
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:20,997
Oh, you're very naughty.

286
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,890
Yes.

287
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,339
You have the right
to remain silent.

288
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,771
Anything you say

289
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:37,979
can and will be held against
you in a court of law.

290
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,477
You have the right
to an attorney.

291
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:43,148
If you can't afford
an attorney,

292
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:46,147
the state will provide you one.

293
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,620
Do you understand your rights?

294
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:51,691
You definitely have a
career in law enforcement.

295
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:57,831
Well, I thought I was
gonna put these on you.

296
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:59,870
- You want this?
- Ah.

297
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,366
Yeah?

298
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:02,837
You want it?

299
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,005
Yes.

300
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:36,372
Mmm.

301
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:49,144
Mmm.

302
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:04,900
Now, what do you mean,
exactly, these visions you mentioned?

303
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,869
Oh, shit. I thought you knew.

304
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:11,604
I told Marty about them,
you know, down the line.

305
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,917
Uh, chemical... flashbacks,

306
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,453
neural damage, you know,

307
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:26,420
from my time in the HIDTA,

308
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:31,098
as in High-Intensity
Drug Trafficking Area.

309
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:48,018
I spent 4 years undercover.

310
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:50,653
You know what that means?

311
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:56,120
That's where they got them
Fed rumors, I first come in.

312
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,854
What, you two
don't know about them?

313
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:05,355
Those files are still
sealed, huh?

314
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,860
Shee-it.

315
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:13,868
Just what have you two
heard about me?

316
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:47,569
You wanted blues?

317
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:49,536
Quaaludes.

318
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:52,030
- Downers?
- Dopey stuff.

319
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,535
- Oh.
- What's it run?

320
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,037
I'm thinking blue go
for three a pill.

321
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,680
We'll say 200 for the bottle.

322
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:11,392
I thought you might
just take 'em.

323
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:17,130
Or that you wanted
somethin' else.

324
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:21,702
Some kind of somethin' else?

325
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,545
No.

326
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:34,386
Then I was thinking,
you're a good-looking man.

327
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,561
You wouldn't need
a shakedown to get some.

328
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:42,097
What about rough
trade, scary guys?

329
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,665
You girls talk.

330
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:46,767
Around here, they're rough

331
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,903
or whiskey-limp.

332
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,536
Seen plenty of guys
that get touchy.

333
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:54,407
Something sets them off and
they're like little boys.

334
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,942
People always go away
around here.

335
00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:00,914
Where would I look,

336
00:21:00,947 --> 00:21:04,384
working girls might know
the blonde?

337
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:08,454
If she was gaming I-10 south
side, I heard of this place.

338
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:10,918
Kind of trailer park.

339
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:15,458
Girls work and stay.
They call it "The Ranch."

340
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,923
Where's that?

341
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:19,461
Like, south of Spanish Lake,

342
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,967
supposed to be.

343
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,103
You know the place?

344
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:30,039
What's your deal?

345
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:34,879
I don't have a deal.

346
00:21:34,913 --> 00:21:37,279
I mean, what do you do?

347
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:42,287
Never mind. I thought
you were gonna bust me.

348
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,120
I told you, I'm not interested.

349
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:47,289
Yeah, I know.

350
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,624
Kinda strange,

351
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:52,623
like you might be dangerous.

352
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:54,790
Well, of course I'm dangerous.

353
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,726
I'm police.

354
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,296
I could do terrible
things to people...

355
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:03,432
with impunity.

356
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:05,641
You know, what'd
you do last night?

357
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:07,673
I called up here late.

358
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,809
What were you doing?

359
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,809
Working.

360
00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:14,346
Was thinking about dropping by.

361
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,483
Where were you?

362
00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:18,482
I was out with girlfriends.

363
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:21,656
Uh-huh. Well,
I don't like that.

364
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,658
What, you're jealous?

365
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,697
Don't be stupid.

366
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,694
I just mean that there's

367
00:22:30,727 --> 00:22:33,197
a crazy man out there,

368
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,659
and he's killing women.

369
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,634
Wait, you mean that girl
again, that Satanic thing?

370
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,833
Everyone's still talking about
that at the courthouse.

371
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,042
It's not just her.

372
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:47,011
There's more.

373
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:50,008
There's more?
Really?

374
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,513
Yeah, well, we're not saying,

375
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:55,989
keeping it out
of the press, but...

376
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:59,556
we're thinking that he's
been doing this a while.

377
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,690
Wow.

378
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,531
Yeah, so no need to go out.

379
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:09,561
You just have a drink here.

380
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:13,234
I can't meet
a nice man at home.

381
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:18,965
That hurts me

382
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:23,007
when you speak to me
in a passive-aggressive way.

383
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,711
I always talk straight to you.

384
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:28,813
Excuse me. I meant that
since you're married,

385
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:31,848
I need to be considering my
options as a young woman.

386
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:34,382
I want things, Marty.

387
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,956
I want things, too.

388
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:42,492
Yeah, you just want your cake

389
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:45,124
and to eat it, too.

390
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:49,998
How good is cake

391
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:52,134
if you can't eat it?

392
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,070
Mmm.

393
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,147
Morning.

394
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,220
Hey, I think I might have
found something good.

395
00:24:09,253 --> 00:24:11,189
Bunny ranch down south,

396
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,653
round Spanish Lake.

397
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:17,155
I thought we were
pulling old johns today.

398
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:19,691
Yeah, we should do this first.

399
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,158
What?

400
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:27,325
You wash up.
You got some pussy on you.

401
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:33,402
Key to a healthy marriage.

402
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:35,834
Oh, that's Maggie, huh?

403
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:39,905
Hey.

404
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,406
What's with your fucking nose?

405
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,509
Nothing, man.
Sorry. Forget it.

406
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:49,709
I get a connotation
being implied here

407
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:52,147
about my wife?

408
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,683
Are you saying that's wife, that
high tide you're walking in with?

409
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:58,113
You got some idea

410
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,985
how my wife's pussy's
supposed to smell?

411
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:06,090
No, I just meant you're wearing the
same clothes as you did yesterday,

412
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:09,257
coupled with the fact
that I ain't stupid.

413
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,265
Wasn't making no comment
as to the...

414
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:15,433
particularity of the scent.

415
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:20,201
You don't say fuck-all
about my wife.

416
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:22,336
Don't say her name.

417
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:28,174
You got some self-loathing to
do this morning, that's fine,

418
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:31,110
but it ain't worth
losing your hands over.

419
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:34,118
How would that work, exactly?

420
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:38,821
Well, I'd just apply
a couple pounds of pressure,

421
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:41,822
snap your wrists.

422
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:45,261
You're Senior Detective.

423
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,963
Think I'm lying?

424
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:34,101
You got a specific
location for this place

425
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,131
or are we just gonna wander
around till we find it?

426
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:39,266
We got some names.

427
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,443
I'm gonna have to ask
for directions.

428
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:48,515
Maybe you could just
follow your nose.

429
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,246
Wherever he picked them up,

430
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,245
I mean, I won't lie.

431
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:58,286
However we left it,

432
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,591
he had some moves.

433
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,422
He knew a few CIs
from his narco days.

434
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:08,598
They knew these parts,
put us in touch

435
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:12,091
with some names,
people to talk to.

436
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,595
How we doing, boys?

437
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:15,100
- Hey.
- Hello.

438
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,638
We're looking for
a little bunny ranch

439
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,775
down around these parts.

440
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:22,080
Y'all know where
we could find it?

441
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:24,114
- No, sir.
- Never heard about it?

442
00:27:24,147 --> 00:27:26,085
- Little whorehouse?
- Nuh-uh.

443
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:27,357
Sorry, man.

444
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,284
Supposed to be stuck up
in the woods around here?

445
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,290
And I'll tell you this,

446
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:34,194
Rust had about as sharp
an eye for weakness

447
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:36,330
as I ever seen.

448
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:44,832
I'll be right back.

449
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,435
It's my bad, boys.

450
00:27:53,468 --> 00:27:56,136
Think we got started
on the wrong foot there.

451
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:57,569
Aah!

452
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,117
Aah!

453
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,086
You remember where that
little whorehouse is, huh?

454
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:23,775
Take 353 South.

455
00:28:23,808 --> 00:28:26,240
Gonna exit off the shoulder
before we get to the 14.

456
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:30,453
From there, we take a dirt
fishing road to Bayou Chenault.

457
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:32,957
Okay.

458
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:11,867
That it?

459
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:14,529
Mm-hmm.

460
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,716
Cop car, y'all.

461
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:34,386
Just trying to get
some freebies.

462
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,305
I don't do no cops...

463
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:52,143
Hello, ma'am.

464
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:56,049
Martin Hart,
Rustin Cohle-- State CID.

465
00:29:57,451 --> 00:29:59,417
This your place?

466
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:02,086
It's my lease.

467
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,624
What is this, some kind
of hillbilly bunny ranch?

468
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:06,424
Excuse me?

469
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,264
You might want to talk
to Sheriff Bilson

470
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:10,464
'fore you start tossin'
accusations around.

471
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,527
No, I ain't got nothing
against hillbillies.

472
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:15,567
Relax. That's not
why we're here. We, uh,

473
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,537
well, something
happened to a girl,

474
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,208
and we need to know if
any of you knew her.

475
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,686
Yeah. That's Dori.

476
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,254
Somethin' happened?

477
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:35,496
You know about that woman
found outside of Erath?

478
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,599
Oh, no.

479
00:30:39,632 --> 00:30:42,270
Did something happen to Dori?

480
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,709
Were you pretty good
friends with her?

481
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:51,710
She was nice to me when
I first came around.

482
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:54,680
Gave me tips and stuff.

483
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:58,381
Tips? About what?

484
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,021
Nothin'.

485
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:06,958
You know, just how to be.

486
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,208
You got any idea where she might have
been staying the last few weeks?

487
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,745
I don't.

488
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:21,709
Her ex is in prison.

489
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:25,213
I guess maybe
she got a new place.

490
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:28,182
She'd been going to church.

491
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:32,890
I was hoping maybe she
just turned things around.

492
00:31:34,764 --> 00:31:38,130
We're gonna need to question any
girls might have known her.

493
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:42,572
That's a tougher ask
than you think.

494
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:45,173
Folks'll be stayin' away,
they hear y'all are out here.

495
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:48,480
Well, ma'am, it's the best
way to get us to leave.

496
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:54,084
You said she left a bag.

497
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,060
Yeah.

498
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:57,892
Can I see it?

499
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,864
Sure.

500
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,636
That girl's not 18.

501
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:20,941
The sheriff know you got
underage working here?

502
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:24,010
What do you know about
where that girl's been,

503
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,143
where she come from?

504
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,572
You want to know
Beth's situation,

505
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:30,939
'fore she ran out on her uncle?

506
00:32:32,307 --> 00:32:34,274
There are other places
she could go.

507
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:39,280
Such holy bullshit from you.

508
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:41,785
It's a woman's body, ain't it?

509
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:43,752
A woman's choice.

510
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:46,581
Well, she don't look
like a woman to me.

511
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:49,087
At that age,
she is not equipped

512
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,560
to make those kind of choices.

513
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,556
But I guess you don't give
a shit what kind of damage

514
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:57,596
she's doing to herself, as long
as you're making your money.

515
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:00,134
Girls walk this Earth
all the time

516
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,437
screwin' for free.

517
00:33:02,469 --> 00:33:04,771
Now, why is it you add
business to the mix,

518
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:07,139
and boys like you can't
stand the thought?

519
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,109
I'll tell you.

520
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,613
It's 'cause suddenly
you don't own it

521
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:14,080
the way you thought you did.

522
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:19,586
Ahem.

523
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,796
Ma'am, you've both
been very helpful.

524
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:26,468
We'll be in touch.

525
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:29,468
Yes, thank you...

526
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,203
for your help.

527
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:43,979
Do something else.

528
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:58,559
That a down payment?

529
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,893
Is shitting on
any moment of decency

530
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,563
part of your job description?

531
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,064
"I closed my eyes
and saw the king

532
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:14,939
in yellow moving
through the forest."

533
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:17,936
This is her diary, Marty.

534
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:19,943
Believe this shit.

535
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,374
A girl that young.

536
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:25,943
You know the sheriff has got
a stake in this place, too.

537
00:34:25,984 --> 00:34:27,909
Fucking Christ.

538
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,411
"The king's children
were marked.

539
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:34,185
They became his angels."

540
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:42,597
The yellow king, Carcosa.

541
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,092
Nut job.

542
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,069
Fried her brain on
whatever she was on.

543
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:51,102
Sounds like she didn't
have much to begin with.

544
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:53,912
Well, it reads like a fantasy.

545
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:58,050
What if he was
dosing her regular,

546
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,556
and over a period of time,
upping the dose

547
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:03,053
little by little
without her knowing it?

548
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:05,928
We should stay out here
today, check around

549
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:07,431
for johns

550
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,599
maybe knew her.

551
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,737
Look at this.

552
00:35:14,674 --> 00:35:16,072
Oh, yeah.

553
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:18,576
Man, a lot of these
type places.

554
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:22,281
Expect the flock
to canvass for 'em.

555
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:24,282
You know, we should go there.

556
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:26,250
Could be the church
everyone mentioned.

557
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:28,787
Well, let's check around for
johns while we're out here

558
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,487
and pick up the church
on Monday.

559
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:36,928
Most of your stuff's still redacted.

560
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:39,558
Now, what's Northshore?

561
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:44,427
Northshore
Psychiatric Hospital,

562
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,899
Lubbock, Texas.

563
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:49,371
I spent 4 months there in '93.

564
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:52,105
- You feel like talking about that?
- Well, sure.

565
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:54,671
Who gives a shit?

566
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,880
Sofia... my daughter.

567
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,878
She was on her tricycle

568
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:08,517
in our driveway. Um...

569
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:18,021
We lived down a--
where a little bend in the road, and...

570
00:36:19,957 --> 00:36:22,527
They said that...

571
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,872
Anyway, afterwards, uh,

572
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:32,407
Claire and I turned
on each other, you know?

573
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:36,080
We... we resented each other

574
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:39,216
being alive, you know?

575
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:47,057
I transferred
from robbery to narco.

576
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,067
Started hitting it,
you know, 24/7.

577
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,068
Street rips, knocking down
doors, and within 3 months

578
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,570
I was ripping off couriers
or ending up in a Ramada Inn

579
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:01,108
with a couple
of fuckin' eight-balls.

580
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,246
Oh, yeah.

581
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,180
Somewhere in there,
Claire left,

582
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:11,087
and somewhere in there,

583
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,590
I emptied a 9 into a crankhead

584
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:17,263
for injecting his infant
daughter with crystal.

585
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:21,264
Said he was trying
to purify her.

586
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,472
State attorney gave me one
chance to stay out of jail.

587
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:31,010
He said, "You can keep your profile, but
we want to make you our wild man junkie."

588
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:34,818
So they did. They made me
a floater, like a trick.

589
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:38,877
You know, any agency or department
needed a deep undercover narco,

590
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:40,852
they got me,

591
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:44,787
and there was no fuckin'
expiration date, baby.

592
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,291
And they kept you
out there for 4 years?

593
00:37:47,324 --> 00:37:49,058
Mm-hmm.

594
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:51,459
And then, February of '93,

595
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:55,396
I killed 3 cartel men
in Port Houston.

596
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:58,964
I took three 25s
in the side and ended up

597
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:02,974
at Northshore Psychiatric
Hospital in Lubbock, Texas,

598
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:05,975
which is kind of funny
in its own rite--

599
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:08,849
psych ward being
in Lubbock, Texas. Heh!

600
00:38:08,882 --> 00:38:12,923
You ever been there? They
offered me a psych pension.

601
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,923
Jackpot, right?

602
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:16,827
And I said no.

603
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,499
I said, "Put me
on homicide somewhere."

604
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:23,499
By then, I was owed
quite a few favors,

605
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:27,738
and, uh, Louisiana was
what they had.

606
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:36,640
Yeah, for a long
time after, I-- I didn't really sleep.

607
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:39,608
Nightmares, PTSD,

608
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:42,249
exhausted nerves, whatever.

609
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,947
Yeah.

610
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:19,949
Why homicide?

611
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,088
Oh, something
I saw at Northshore.

612
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:28,223
Quote from Corinthians.

613
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:35,959
"The body is not
one member, but many."

614
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:43,172
"Now are they many,
but... of one body."

615
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:46,607
What's that mean, though?

616
00:39:47,977 --> 00:39:51,577
I was just trying to stay
a part of the body now. Heh!

617
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,283
The fishing pole's not working.

618
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:56,754
- Just ask Grandpa.
- No.

619
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:59,621
- Yeah.
- Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.

620
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:02,630
You'll know, honey.
It'll yank at you hard.

621
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:05,136
- Okay.
- Why don't you...

622
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,304
How's that case going?
The big one?

623
00:40:09,937 --> 00:40:12,544
Working it, you know.

624
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:17,884
Things like that didn't happen
these parts when I was young.

625
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,386
People said "ma'am"
and "sir."

626
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,852
Families stayed together.

627
00:40:22,892 --> 00:40:26,429
Yeah, that's how it was, huh?

628
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:28,933
Not all the time.

629
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:31,367
There was more dignity.

630
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,406
Everyone wasn't out in the street,
yelling about their rights.

631
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:38,907
Well, if things were so great,

632
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,446
they never would have changed.

633
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,542
Hmm.

634
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,015
Nothing is going on.

635
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:45,510
I'm just saying,
if there's a problem,

636
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,380
you can talk to me.
You know that.

637
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:49,914
If I have a problem with
someone, I talk to them, Ma.

638
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,081
Well, you should be able
to talk to me.

639
00:40:52,114 --> 00:40:54,754
I know what it's like
to be married to a man.

640
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:57,585
You think they're all
the same, huh?

641
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:59,592
I don't know why you're
so rude to me.

642
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,887
If you're frustrated,
don't take it out on me.

643
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:04,389
I think that you need
to get your cable fixed

644
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:07,061
and stop confusing me
with your soap operas.

645
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:09,733
Well, you beat up on
what you can't control.

646
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:12,562
Makes it bad
for everybody else.

647
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,163
- I don't know how.
- I don't care. Just try.

648
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,172
- You do it.
- I can't.

649
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:18,697
You have smaller fingers.

650
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:21,231
Macie, just do it.

651
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:25,576
So you're telling me the
world isn't getting worse?

652
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,605
I seen kids today,
all in black,

653
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:30,972
wearing makeup,
shit on their faces.

654
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:32,980
Everything's sex.

655
00:41:33,013 --> 00:41:34,613
Clinton.

656
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:38,418
You know, throughout history,

657
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:41,795
I bet every old man probably
said the same thing.

658
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:43,795
And old men die,

659
00:41:43,828 --> 00:41:46,364
and the world keeps spinning.

660
00:41:48,566 --> 00:41:50,974
- How are the girls?
- I got this lead--

661
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,006
I got this lead
I wanted to check up on.

662
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,016
I told you about it.

663
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:58,146
- Maybe your dad could bring you back.
- No.

664
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:00,081
You didn't tell me
anything about it.

665
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:02,552
This is a family day.

666
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:05,058
I did tell you about it.

667
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:08,624
I mentioned it.
It's the new case.

668
00:42:11,992 --> 00:42:15,099
Okay, well, how about we
all head back, then?

669
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,142
Hmm. All right,
sweetheart.

670
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:19,973
Come on! Let's go!

671
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:21,645
My line's tangled.

672
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:23,142
Just paddle in.

673
00:42:23,183 --> 00:42:25,851
Okay. Told you!

674
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,893
Thanks for
the lovely afternoon.

675
00:42:27,926 --> 00:42:30,027
Oh.

676
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:33,364
Thank you.

677
00:42:57,487 --> 00:43:00,091
Afternoon, sir.

678
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:03,192
- How you doing today, Officer?
- I have a question for you.

679
00:43:03,226 --> 00:43:05,458
You ever seen this girl?

680
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:06,658
You never seen her before?

681
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:09,067
- Never before.
- Hm-mmm, not here.

682
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,995
Question.

683
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:38,995
I'm looking for this young lady.
You recognize her?

684
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:42,195
I might need a memory jog.

685
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,767
Dora.
Young blonde?

686
00:43:44,808 --> 00:43:46,805
Dora. Dora, Dora,
Dora, Dora.

687
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:48,773
Dora.

688
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:50,741
Have any guys come
around lately,

689
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:52,877
looking for anything
more than a good time?

690
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,412
You might be able to remember
for a little more money?

691
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:56,610
I might.

692
00:43:56,643 --> 00:43:58,579
You might?

693
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:09,027
Years we've been through this.

694
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,534
Sweetheart, listen to me.

695
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,964
There is nowhere else
I want to be.

696
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,435
I wonder if you even
know you're lying.

697
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:18,932
Oh, come on!

698
00:44:18,973 --> 00:44:20,742
Shh.

699
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:22,708
Bad enough,

700
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:26,043
the shit I got to wade
through on a daily basis,

701
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:29,116
bring me this
"feel bad for me" crap

702
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,718
when I work 30 hours straight
and spent the weekend

703
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:35,319
listening to
your dad's bullshit?

704
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,297
I come home, the one place

705
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,127
where there's supposed
to be peace and calm,

706
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,198
- and you throw this shit--
- Who told you that?

707
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:46,429
It's not always that way.
It's not supposed to be.

708
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:49,869
It's supposed to be what I want,
it's supposed to help me.

709
00:44:49,902 --> 00:44:51,374
We do help you!

710
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:53,406
All the goddamn time!

711
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:58,912
Okay, well, what do you
want me to say?

712
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:02,921
You want me to talk about
the woman, had antlers?

713
00:45:02,954 --> 00:45:06,057
Do you want me to tell you
about the kids disappearing,

714
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,128
and maybe you'll stop with the
"poor me" little whiny bullshit?

715
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,599
Is that what you're
saying, hmm?

716
00:45:14,632 --> 00:45:17,536
That I'm trying to make
you feel bad for me?

717
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:20,671
Is that really how you
want to play this?

718
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:22,440
No, honey.

719
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:25,841
I think you're the
greatest woman I ever met,

720
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:28,810
and you're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

721
00:45:28,843 --> 00:45:31,821
But, yeah, you know, sometimes

722
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,849
I think you might
have a penchant

723
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:36,817
for self-pity.

724
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:39,356
And right now,
I need you to be strong

725
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:41,994
so that I can do my job.

726
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:47,836
You have developed some
sort of selective deafness.

727
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:51,236
You used to not be such
a chicken shit, I swear.

728
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,075
Even your mom thinks
you're a ball-buster.

729
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,584
Tell the girls dinner.

730
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:17,587
Mmm.

731
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,863
You don't have
a mommy or daddy anymore.

732
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:28,895
Yours just died in an accident.

733
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:30,863
How?

734
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:33,400
In a car accident.
Someone--

735
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:36,406
Dinnertime, kids.
Go to the kitchen.

736
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:38,373
Are you coming?

737
00:46:38,406 --> 00:46:40,406
Yeah, of course.
I'm starving.

738
00:46:40,439 --> 00:46:41,838
Really?

739
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:45,410
- Yeah, really.
- Good.

740
00:46:58,094 --> 00:47:02,263
You know how
I think about my daughter now?

741
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:06,600
You know what...

742
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:09,271
what she was spared?

743
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,281
Sometimes I feel grateful.

744
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:22,125
Doctors said

745
00:47:22,158 --> 00:47:24,159
she didn't feel a thing.

746
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:27,125
Went straight into a coma,

747
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:31,101
and then, somewhere in that...

748
00:47:31,134 --> 00:47:35,168
blackness, she slipped off
into another,

749
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:37,807
deeper kind.

750
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:45,815
Isn't that a beautiful way
to go out? Heh!

751
00:47:47,722 --> 00:47:50,384
Painlessly,

752
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:53,254
as a happy child.

753
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:56,823
Hmm.

754
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:01,999
Yeah, trouble with...

755
00:48:02,032 --> 00:48:04,336
dying later is you've
already grown up.

756
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:07,841
Heh! Damage is done.
It's too late.

757
00:48:07,874 --> 00:48:10,838
You got kids?

758
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,046
Mmm.

759
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:18,916
Well, you got the hubris

760
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:21,883
it must take to...

761
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:25,416
yank a soul out of nonexistence

762
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:28,553
into this meat.

763
00:48:29,856 --> 00:48:35,056
And to force a life
into this thresher.

764
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:42,429
And as for my daughter,
she, uh...

765
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:45,937
she spared me the sin

766
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,938
of being a father.

767
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:50,441
Hey, Cathleen,

768
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:51,873
you little vixen.

769
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:54,852
Any chance of some coffee?

770
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:56,883
- Of course.
- Okay.

771
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:58,884
Who are these guys?

772
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:02,358
Some assholes Quesada brought in.
Coffee on its way.

773
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:04,230
- Hey, morning, Marty.
- Hey.

774
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:07,229
Major's introducing me.
New flying squad.

775
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:10,305
You know Mark
Daughtry, Ted Bertrand.

776
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:11,801
Daughtry.

777
00:49:11,842 --> 00:49:13,305
Ted.

778
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:15,306
- Jimmy Dufrene.
- Jimmy Dufrene.

779
00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:17,241
What's up?

780
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:20,781
We've been tasked with investigating
crimes with possible occult links.

781
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:23,220
There's been a rash
of animal mutilations,

782
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,683
cemeteries defiled.

783
00:49:24,724 --> 00:49:27,723
- And they want to see what we have
on the Lange case. - Uh-huh.

784
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,755
Well, this task force
is important to the Commander

785
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:31,765
and to the Governor's Office.

786
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:34,765
You know, a lot of people
are concerned about it.

787
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:36,763
You know, me, I don't
see the connection

788
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:39,772
between two dead cats
and a murdered woman.

789
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:41,973
But then, I'm from Texas.

790
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:43,708
Heh!

791
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:46,011
We're not stepping
on your toes, Marty.

792
00:49:46,044 --> 00:49:48,577
We just got the mandate. We got to
compare notes with what you got.

793
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,711
Yeah.

794
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:51,136
- Here you are, Detective.
- No. Oh.

795
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:52,904
- Thanks, Cathleen.
- You got it.

796
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:55,807
Xerox all you want.

797
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,679
Make you feel like good cops.

798
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:08,688
You two, my office.

799
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,402
Cohle, we got a new rule
around here, especially for you.

800
00:50:14,435 --> 00:50:16,937
You got an opinion
about anything,

801
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,066
you hold on to it.

802
00:50:19,106 --> 00:50:22,075
You hold on to it
or you tell it to Marty.

803
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:25,039
Otherwise, button
your big, fat mouth.

804
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:28,177
However smart you are, you're
not as smart as you think.

805
00:50:28,211 --> 00:50:30,179
Be serious, boss.

806
00:50:30,218 --> 00:50:33,112
This God-bothering shit.

807
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:35,689
It's a political circle-jerk.
You know this.

808
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:37,655
Is this a place you live?

809
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,149
Where are you, huh?

810
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,524
You had anything in the last weeks?
You got a suspect?

811
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:44,691
Give us some more guys

812
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:46,889
to follow up KAs,
track records.

813
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:50,558
No, our bosses don't want you
at all, you understand?

814
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:52,422
I don't want you.

815
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:56,093
You are upright only by the
grace of this man's reputation.

816
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:57,662
Goddamn, Cohle.

817
00:50:57,695 --> 00:51:01,398
How many ways are there for me
to say, "Shut the fuck up"?

818
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:06,637
I mean, we work
under command, right?

819
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:11,213
Now, our betters want a public,
high-profile show of response.

820
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:13,140
Shit, I got a state senator,

821
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:16,317
he's trying to label Satanic
graffiti as a hate crime.

822
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:19,884
That has nothing to do with our
DB, and that's the fact of it.

823
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:21,387
Okay, okay. Fine.

824
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,554
Let's say that's true,
all right?

825
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:26,554
Let's say that you guys get
the case all to yourselves.

826
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:30,362
You ever solve a murder, been in
the red more than a week?

827
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:33,864
You ever clear one where two rounds of
questions didn't hand you the fucking answer?

828
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:36,960
- Oh, come on--
- No, no, you got leads, you got a timeline.

829
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:39,002
You know what I got?
I got a whodunit

830
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,938
where my two detectives
are stalling,

831
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:44,642
and I got a brand-new task force
wants to take it off our hands.

832
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:45,810
We have a lead--

833
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:48,074
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Fuck off, Cohle.

834
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:53,619
Christ.

835
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,820
It's your call.

836
00:51:57,188 --> 00:51:59,289
You want to dump this one off?

837
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:01,752
You know, I'd think about it,
given the spotlight.

838
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:05,455
You know, Teddy Bertrand's a good detective.
You know him.

839
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,633
Well, you're a smart-ass
with your mouth shut.

840
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:13,601
I was just gonna say

841
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:15,600
we've got a lead on a church.

842
00:52:15,641 --> 00:52:18,104
Our vic was spending
a lot of time there.

843
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:20,944
That's where we were headed.
It could be the break we need.

844
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:23,948
Inside, whatever they're
putting over you,

845
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:26,516
how much more time
could you get us?

846
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:28,955
Right now, it's up
for discussion, but,

847
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:30,955
you know, Tuttle's lighting
a fire under this.

848
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:33,996
Without a suspect,
they're just gonna

849
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:36,996
stop asking questions, Marty,
and they're gonna give orders.

850
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,499
That's that.

851
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:40,996
Give us the rest of the month

852
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:43,003
before they lump it
into whatever

853
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:46,034
the play is with
the task force, yeah?

854
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,445
I'll try.

855
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:53,475
Two weeks, and then you two
start catching again.

856
00:52:53,516 --> 00:52:54,948
Yeah.

857
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,684
Let's cut to the point.

858
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:02,189
As the crow flies,
y'all are wanting to ask

859
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:05,759
about that big throwdown
in the woods, yeah?

860
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,199
Eventually, sure.

861
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:09,231
Right now, we're just
trying to track the case.

862
00:53:09,264 --> 00:53:11,799
How Cohle worked it,
especially.

863
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:18,140
Which indicates you think
I'm too thick to realize

864
00:53:18,173 --> 00:53:21,244
that y'all are trying
to jam somebody up.

865
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:24,412
You're on to something new.

866
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,680
So Cohle didn't want
to give it to the task force.

867
00:53:29,713 --> 00:53:31,744
Did you?

868
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,752
No, I did not.

869
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:52,266
It don't make sense.
There is nothing out here.

870
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:57,978
According to this map, it should
be within these few miles.

871
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:04,347
Well-- ahem-- I guess
if it's one of those

872
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,390
tent revival places,
they move around.

873
00:54:07,423 --> 00:54:09,392
Yeah.

874
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:12,032
Tents usually do.

875
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:17,537
There's no date on this
flyer, which is strange.

876
00:54:22,707 --> 00:54:24,811
Something up there.

877
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,143
Wait, wait, back up.

878
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:17,250
Are you saying you were
hallucinating on the job?

879
00:55:17,283 --> 00:55:18,851
Mmm.

880
00:55:18,884 --> 00:55:22,853
No. I mean, I could always tell what
was real or what wasn't, you know.

881
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:27,357
So when I'd see things, like, man,
I'd just-- roll with it.

882
00:55:27,398 --> 00:55:29,196
You still see things?

883
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:32,198
No.

884
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,637
No, they stopped altogether

885
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,741
after I was clean
a couple years.

886
00:55:39,774 --> 00:55:42,405
No numbers on this place.

887
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:46,910
Fire must have happened
a long time ago.

888
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:22,520
Okay.
Place is trashed.

889
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:25,688
This ain't no kinda anything.

890
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:34,771
Yeah, back then, the visions.

891
00:56:34,804 --> 00:56:38,972
Yeah, most of the time,
I was convinced that I'd lost it.

892
00:56:40,373 --> 00:56:42,477
Marty?

893
00:56:56,758 --> 00:56:59,926
But there were other times...

894
00:57:05,134 --> 00:57:10,138
I thought I was mainlining
the secret truth of the universe.

895
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:56,214
