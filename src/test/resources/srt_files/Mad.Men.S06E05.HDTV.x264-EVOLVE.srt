I hope you left us something.

You will be here only
<i>when I tell you to be here.</i>

4
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:11,372
We're done, Peter.

5
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:12,694
Have a happy birthday.

6
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:13,844
How old are you gonna be?

7
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:15,618
Forty.

8
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,002
So when you're forty,
how old will I be?

9
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:19,460
You'll be dead.

10
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:21,398
My boss made a call.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,230
You told Mayor Lindsay.

12
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:28,982
We have to be careful.
We can't fall in love.

<i>I do believe that was</i>
<i>everything on your list.</i>

23
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,489
It's a little farther east
than I wanted.

24
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,458
In fact, it's about
as far east as you could go.

25
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,093
You can see the highway
from the corner.

26
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,461
You can see the river.

27
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,063
And who needs Central Park

28
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,799
when you can smell the ocean
and the Hungarian bakeries?

29
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,051
Believe me, when they finish
the Second Avenue subway,

30
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:44,837
this apartment
will quadruple in value.

You let me do the talking.

33
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,145
Sorry I'm late.

34
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,982
It's quite a hike
between First and York.

35
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,950
It's got to be longer
than a normal block.

36
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,585
I don't think so.

37
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,637
We just got started.

38
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,556
What do you think?

39
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,058
I think no one's gonna catch
that doorman napping.

40
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,327
I left your name.

41
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,746
It's got a doorman.

42
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,000
I was telling Peggy that an offer
is coming in at asking price.

43
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,551
We'd have to beat it.

44
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,403
So it's in your best interest
to be decisive

45
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,021
and take this property
seriously.

46
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,507
Well, okay,
but it's not my decision.

47
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,977
Ginny, we are taking
this seriously.

48
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,980
- What Abe means is--
- I'm more her trusted advisor.

49
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,216
An interested party.

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,418
Oh. I see.

51
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,087
I, uh, misunderstood.

52
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,590
I'm going to flush
that toilet again.

53
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,995
She didn't know
I wasn't the buyer?

54
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,964
So all this time
she was just being rude.

55
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,333
( laughs ) Forget about her.

56
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,468
Is it too far east?

57
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,875
Betty:
<i>Dinner.</i>

00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,950
<i>Bobby, Sally, let's go.</i>

<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,761
Look at you two.
Heading to the track?

61
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,013
( laughs )

62
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,316
- Where are you going?
- DC, if Jonesy can find a cab.

63
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,869
- Hope you're not in a rush.
- We have a car coming.

64
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,004
6:30?
We should have done that.

65
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,656
We're not going
to miss the train.

66
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,157
Where are you going?

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,928
They said DC.

68
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,030
I mean, why are you going?

69
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,834
Arnie was invited last minute
to give a keynote address.

70
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,636
Did you have to tell him
it was last minute?

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,138
I guess the point is somebody
more important fell out.

72
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,057
It's a very
distinguished group.

73
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:04,093
And you must have been
at least as important.

74
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,613
Either way, it sounds like a good
excuse for a weekend in Washington.

75
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:11,984
Yes. Come Monday morning,
it'll all be a dream.

76
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,453
We should really go away.

77
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,355
Looks like you're going
somewhere fun now.

78
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,524
We are.
Megan's up for an award.

79
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,760
Good for you.
Maybe tomorrow

80
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,895
you'll be calling the producers
and asking for a raise.

81
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,497
No, it's for advertising.

82
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,098
The Ad Club of New York.

83
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,901
- Paul Newman's coming.
- My goodness.

84
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,670
You're really good
at everything.

85
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,339
I was just a name on the team.

86
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,808
There's the car.

87
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:38,110
Well, break a leg.

88
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,498
You, too.

89
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh, and, Don...

90
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,985
we're going to DC.

91
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,903
( laughs )

92
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,434
Hey, Pop, I--

93
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,904
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

94
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,505
We were waiting for you.

95
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,458
Look, miss, whatever he told
you we were interested in,

96
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,345
- we're not.
- See how funny he is?

97
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,314
Now, don't be rude.
This is Beverly Farber.

98
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,083
She is Chaim Farber's daughter.

99
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,320
I'm-- our dads,
they play chess together.

100
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,172
Oh, uh...

101
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:26,959
well, I...
it's nice to meet you.

102
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,478
And now that you're home
from a busy day

103
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,314
on Madison Avenue,

104
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,633
I think you should go out
and have some dinner.

105
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,168
What?

106
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,538
Maybe we should
do this another time.

107
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,341
Nonsense. There's no
time like the present.

108
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,710
<i>You both should have some fun.</i>

109
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,580
She's a schoolteacher.
She works all the time.

110
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,949
I need to shave,
change my clothes, prepare.

111
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,151
I mean, look at her.
She had a jump on me.

112
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,136
( laughs ) I did.

113
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,123
I was led to believe
that you knew about this.

114
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,225
- Why did you tell her that?
- What's the difference?

115
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,763
Look at her. I'm obviously
doing you a disservice.

116
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,037
At least we're close
to the kitchen.

117
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,639
It's not fair that all the
big agencies are up front.

118
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,274
Closer to their trophies.

119
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,992
But at least we're gonna
eat before them.

120
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,514
Oh, I see Peggy back there.
We should go say hello.

121
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,734
- I'm gonna wait for the group.
- You can't avoid her forever.

122
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,068
I'm not.

123
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:27,753
Tell her that no matter what,

124
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,740
her laxative radio spot
is the sentimental favorite.

125
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,367
Megan:
<i>Hello, stranger.</i>

126
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,986
I was hoping I'd see you.

127
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,838
You know, other than on TV.

128
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,441
- You don't watch.
- My mother and sister do.

129
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,259
Really?
Do they hate me?

130
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,877
Oh, just a minute.

131
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,030
Megan, I want you
to meet Jim Cutler.

132
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:56,532
He's the president of CGC.

133
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,818
This is Megan Draper.
She's also a finalist.

134
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,386
You must be Don's wife.

135
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,987
When I started out,
they didn't make

136
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,956
copywriters like you.

137
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,474
Good luck.

138
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,613
He's the head of accounts.

139
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,898
He's like Roger
with bad breath.

140
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,634
So he knows who you are.
It must be going well.

141
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,353
If I survive tonight.

142
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,872
CGC has no other finalists.

143
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,707
Other-- they have none.

144
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,510
I only came because
it seemed important to Don.

145
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,646
I bet it is. We're the
only finalists from SCDP

146
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,115
and neither of us
work there anymore.

147
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,599
My work was for beans

148
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,252
and they aren't even
a client anymore.

149
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,104
I don't want
to talk about this.

150
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,072
I want to talk
about my apartment.

151
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,358
I made an offer today. I think
we're gonna be neighbors.

152
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,927
- 84th and York.
- You're buying a place?

153
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,663
Well, I paid off my debts
and helped out my mother

154
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,033
and it turns out I still
have this tax problem.

155
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,770
Don't apologize, Peggy.
You deserve it.

156
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,304
Thank you.

157
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,123
I should get back.

158
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,309
I have to walk all the
way down to the front.

159
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,895
You're terrible.

160
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,917
Joan: <i>These are the worst
seats in the room.</i>

161
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,003
- Don Draper, this is Randall Walsh.
- A pleasure to meet you.

162
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,923
Randy here is in insurance and he wants
to come in for an official visit.

163
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,926
Look, man, it's not like we're not
supposed to talk about business here.

164
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,995
You want a presentation
right now?

165
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,230
I don't think we'll interrupt the
proceedings, wherever they are.

166
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,767
- I just thought you two should meet.
- We've already met.

167
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,837
In fact, I'm pretty sure we've
had this meeting already, too.

168
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,440
- And it went well.
- So where's our check?

169
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,876
- He's solid.
- Okay, Randy.

170
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,712
Go get back in your cage.

171
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,566
- What was that?
- Don't worry about it.

172
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,989
Have no fear. They're
gonna fire off a cannon

173
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,808
- when the atrocities begin.
- ( laughter )

174
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,510
Hello all.
You remember my wife Nan.

175
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,346
Hello, everyone.
Good luck.

176
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,966
I told you, Nan, Peggy's
the only one competing.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,035
Well, I didn't know
what else to say.

178
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,873
So you probably figured out
by now that you didn't win.

179
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,742
<i>- Ted. - But it doesn't matter,</i>
<i>because next year you will.</i>

180
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,078
- Ted.
- And the year after. Just a second, honey.

181
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,133
- Hey, man, sorry.
- Oh, I'm in your seat.

182
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,801
Nan, you wanted
to see Paul Newman.

183
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,320
Here he is.

184
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,023
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

185
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,676
Emcee: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

( applause )

189
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,410
So you like kids?

190
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,647
Excuse me?

191
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,349
I was asking because
you're a teacher,

192
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,985
but I realize how that could
sound like something else.

193
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,087
I'm a student teacher.

194
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,122
I'm getting my master's
at Hunter.

195
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,593
And, yes, I like kids.
Some kids.

196
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,346
I just really can't believe he
brought you to the apartment.

197
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,516
Stop saying that. You
don't know where I live.

198
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,236
Well, it's kind of early
to find out, isn't it?

199
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,773
Yes, I suppose it is.

200
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,758
I don't know
what you're expecting.

201
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,227
I mean, a couple of alter kockers
arrange a little meeting like this,

202
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,396
it sounds very old world.
But it doesn't feel like it.

203
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,082
I mean, you're a sexy girl
and you smell great.

204
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,667
<i>You don't need to be set up.</i>

205
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,352
And I sure as hell
didn't arrange this.

206
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,120
I'm sure my father told you
what a Lothario I am,

207
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,689
but I'm not.
I'm very anxious about it.

208
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,791
I've never had sex,
not even once.

209
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,662
( laughs ) Okay.

210
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,436
What am I doing? I ordered
soup, I just said that.

211
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,539
Michael...

212
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,943
I'm just doing a favor
for my parents.

213
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,578
Tonight will not be the night.

214
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,616
And I saw a picture of you

215
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,484
and, honestly,
you're very handsome.

216
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,689
And I'm obviously very shallow.

217
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,860
- I am?
- You must have heard that before.

218
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:05,931
So...

219
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,899
do you make a lot
of money teaching?

220
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,635
( laughs ) No.

221
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,771
Emcee: <i>Ladies and
gentlemen, Paul Newman.</i>

222
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,717
Newman: <i>Good evening.
I am Paul Newman.</i>

223
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,686
<i>The Advertising Club</i>
<i>of New York</i>

224
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,023
has been kind enough to let me
say a few words here tonight.

225
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,460
And I want to make one thing
clear from the very start.

226
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,495
- I need binoculars.
- Shh.

227
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,230
Newman: <i>I'm not here
because I'm an actor.</i>

228
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,733
We invited him
because he's an actor.

229
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,901
Newman: <i>I'm here because I've got six</i>
<i>kids and I'm worried about their future.</i>

230
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,903
That's not an actor,
that's a speck.

231
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,306
Gene McCarthy stood up
to Lyndon Johnson

232
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,841
before Bobby Kennedy.

233
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,310
<i>The others backed into</i>
<i>the election</i>

234

<i>with their fingers to the wind,</i>

235

237
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,184
I know Bobby Kennedy,

238
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,186

- <i>What have you to say?</i>
- ( crowd murmuring )

244
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,073
No, that can't be.

245
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,659
Who the hell said that?

Woman:
How awful.

247
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,336
Emcee: If I could have your
attention for a moment, please.

248
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,288
<i>A moment of your attention.</i>

249
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,490
<i>Not wanting to interrupt</i>
<i>the festivities,</i>

we hoped to keep this news
until the end of the event.

251
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:46,098
As it stands,
let's take 10 minutes

252
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,500
<i>to talk out this terrible event</i>

253

<i>and then resume the program.</i>

254
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,276
What do you think happened?

255
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,412
- What do you think?
- Come on.

256
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,821
I guess Puerto Rico.

257
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,822
But who has time?

258
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,927
Your father says you've even
written some billboards.

259
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,795
That must be exciting.

260
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,264
You'd think so, but they
usually change it so much

261
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,117
by the time they put it up there, it just
makes you angry every time you walk by.

00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,344
Don't worry. I'm sure you
can make your money back

470
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:53,979
on some Movie of the Week
next fall

471
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,297
about the death of a great man.

472
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,133
That is not what I meant.

473
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,435
Let me put this
in terms you'll understand.

474
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:03,138
That man had a wife
and four children.

475
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,646
<i>( doors slam )</i>

476
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:12,948
<i>( knocks )</i>

477
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:14,699
I'm sorry I'm late.

478
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,117
Would you like coffee?

479
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:17,752
Dawn, I'm just glad
you're okay.

480
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:19,320
Joan was trying to reach you.

481
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,323
The phone was out
for a little bit last night

482
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:23,892
and, well, it took
some time to get here.

483
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,894
I don't think
you should work today.

484
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:28,280
I couldn't reach you. I assumed
you weren't coming in.

485
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:30,365
My mother told me I should.

486
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:35,303
Well, Mr. Cooper just
announced that out of respect

487
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:37,038
we're going to close
the office early.

488
00:24:37,056 --> 00:24:39,441
- Oh.
- That's probably a good idea.

489
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,994
- Mr. Sterling still wants to have the
3:00 meeting. - Are we closed or not?

490
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:45,847
Stan and Ginsberg will also be joining.
Do you want to cancel it?

491
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:48,917
- If you're gonna stay, I'll stay.
- No, you go.

492
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:51,636
I'd really rather
be here today.

493
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:55,256
Okay.

494
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,050
We're all so sorry.

495
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,038
Do you want anything?

496
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,974
No.

497
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:21,289
( phone rings )

498
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,527
- Hello?
- Peggy Olson, please.

499
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:27,562
- This is Peggy.
- Oh.

500
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:30,498
I was about to send over your
offer and it occurred to me--

501
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:33,518
Oh, my offer. I completely
forgot about that.

502
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:36,004
- You haven't sent it?
- No, I haven't.

503
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:38,540
Well, no one's gonna want
to look at that today.

504
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:40,108
May I speak?

505
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:42,494
I thought the same thing,
but then I realized

506
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:44,246
there's trouble 10 blocks away.

507
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,047
They're probably
on pins and needles.

508
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:49,084
So am I. Do I want
to live up there?

509
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:52,020
Get ahold of yourself.
The other buyer never came in.

510
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:54,222
Why don't we come in
at 5,000 under asking

511
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:55,874
and give them 24 hours
to respond?

512
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:57,909
<i>We'll let the TV news</i>
<i>do the rest.</i>

513
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,629
- I don't know.
- This is the only apartment for you.

514
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:02,697
You don't want to be
kicking yourself next week.

515
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:05,066
And, of course, I'll wait
until tomorrow to present.

516
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:09,704
Good girl.

517
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:17,963
Randall Walsh,
you remember Don.

518
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:20,882
This is Stan Rizzo
and Michael Ginsberg.

519
00:26:28,591 --> 00:26:30,826
Randall, would you
like a drink?

520
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,062
Never. I really don't
even want to talk.

521
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:37,098
I was trying to communicate without
words, but it's not working.

522
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,434
Randy, it never works.

523
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:43,004
Randall has an idea and the ad
director won't take a chance.

524
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,273
You're in the property
insurance business.

525
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:48,043
I'll bet you're about
to get hit pretty hard.

526
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:49,911
Forget about that.

527
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:52,047
This is about
a no bullshit approach

528
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:53,748
to why I got
into this business.

529
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:56,084
People say they care.

530
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,520
I really care.

531
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:05,143
We're waiting for you, Randall.

532
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:09,781
All I see when I close my eyes

533
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:13,952
is our name
and a Molotov cocktail

534
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:15,954
being lit with a match.

535
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,406
And then a coupon
at the bottom.

536
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:22,978
The ad sales guy
didn't like that?

537
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:25,480
I know what it looks like--
fearmongering.

538
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:27,516
But this is the opposite.

539
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,885
This is a coded message
that came to me

540
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,686
when I was visited
by the spirit

541
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:34,289
of Dr. King last night.

542
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:37,592
He said that I should question
the whole property thing, man.

543
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:40,795
It makes you happy, right?

544
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,363
( stifled laugh )

545
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:45,233
No, I think it was

546
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:48,103
his end will always
be in poor taste.

547
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:50,438
'Cause you'd rather
not think about it.

548
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:52,874
But there is a tear,
and in that tear

549
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,477
are all the tears in the world,

550
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,246
all the animals crying.

551
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:02,584
You're right-- I don't
want to think about it.

552
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:05,103
What Don's saying is
despite what we believe

553
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:06,805
to be good intentions,

554
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:09,057
you're allowing
the emotions of the day,

555
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:12,260
and whatever else you got in your
system, to influence your judgment.

556
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:14,529
Are you forgetting
what Tecumseh said?

557
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,734
Heya howa howa hoya.

558
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,471
- Heya howa howa.
- I had forgotten that.

559
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:25,156
We'll think about it.

560
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,996
This is an opportunity.

561
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:33,782
The heavens
are telling us to change.

562
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:39,554
You talked
to Dr. King's ghost?

563
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:41,489
Make sure Randy
doesn't get lost.

564
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:47,912
- I had to wait around for that?
- I don't know.

565
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:50,915
He was very emotional.
He talked me off a roof once.

566
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,500
I kind of owed him.
You want a drink?

567
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,135
I just want to go home.

568
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,187
Someone's gonna do
that idea, you know.

569
00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:57,889
Not us.

570
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,345
Reporter: <i>Three deaths
have been reported</i>

<i>There are no details yet on the
circumstances surrounding them.</i>

573
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,620
<i>More than 350 persons have

<i>Firefighting was hampered</i>

576

Megan: <i>It's Betty. You're supposed</i>
<i>to pick up the kids.</i>

579
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:28,003
Oh, shit.

580
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:33,608
Got it.
Hello.

581
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:35,110
I knew you would forget.

582
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:37,278
You really want them down here?

583
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:40,482
I know you don't. You get out of
every opportunity to see them.

584
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,517
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>how strange they're acting.</i>

585
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,269
The news is very upsetting.

586
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,887
I'm sure it has nothing
to do with the fact

587
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,489
that their father
forgot about them.

588
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:49,324
You want me to come up
there and get them,

589
00:29:49,358 --> 00:29:51,493
drive right through
everything after dark?

590
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:53,294
Well, of course,
Henry thinks it's fine,

591
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,296
but he's not as concerned
about their safety as you are.

592
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,165
Well, Henry would know.

593
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,701
I guarantee you'd go
to Canada on your knees

594
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:01,436
to pick up your girlfriend.

595
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:04,089
I don't believe this.

596
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:07,575
I'm going to get the kids.

597
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:10,311
<i>...relatively little interference
during the afternoon.</i>

598
00:30:11,564 --> 00:30:13,598
Really?

599
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,583
They called in the troops
in Washington,

600
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:18,536
but Henry says we're fine here.

601
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:20,989
She's a piece of work.

602
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:23,808
<i>Looting spread to the downtown</i>
<i>shopping section of the city</i>

603
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:26,794
<i>and as darkness fell,</i>
<i>arrests increased.</i>

604
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:29,097
<i>( sirens wailing )</i>

605
00:30:41,377 --> 00:30:44,879
You finished with that?
You can walk me to work.

606
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:47,315
I'm already at work.

607
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,085
Since when are you
going in on Saturday?

608
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,987
Since I don't want to be
in front of the TV set.

609
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:56,624
Good as new.

610
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:58,643
This?

611
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:00,662
This is a mess.

612
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:04,232
You can't sew, you can't
cook, you can't clean.

613
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:07,568
You don't think there's a reason
you have all these flaws?

614
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,771
You need a girl.

615
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:11,706
But maybe you don't like 'em.

616
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,675
I like girls, Dad.

617
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,244
If that was true, you'd be
in bed with her right now.

618
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:18,513
I don't think
anybody's in the mood.

619
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:20,398
It's quite the opposite.

620
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,350
Now's the time
when a man and a woman

621
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:24,285
need to be together the most.

622
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,172
In a catastrophe.

623
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:30,125
In the flood, the animals
went two by two.

624
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,193
You, you're gonna get on
the ark with your father.

625
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,595
I can find my own girls, okay?

626
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,448
Okay.

627
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,918
I'll bring you a sandwich.

628

I'm glad you finally slept.

631
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:16,311
What's going on?

632
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:18,146
We're going to a vigil
in the park.

633
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,818
- You're not supposed to be watching TV.
- I'm not.

634
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:25,754
You are, and Mom
said you can't.

635
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:28,590
Sally, stop it.

636
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:30,592
Troy and Bridget called.
They're gonna meet us there.

637
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:32,193
We'll be back
in a couple of hours.

638
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:35,113
I don't feel well.

639
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:40,068
You go on ahead.
I'll watch him.

640
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:43,772
Come on.

641
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:48,777
Look, I just can't sit around
in the apartment anymore.

642
00:32:48,811 --> 00:32:50,412
I feel like
I have to do something.

643
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,631
I understand.

644
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:54,633
I knew you wouldn't go.

645
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:08,396
You want some aspirin?

646
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:15,203
Hey.
Turn it off.

647

Tell me exactly
what your mother said.

649
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,279
I'm not allowed
to watch TV for a week.

650
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:28,917
Dr. Zaius:
<i>Man has no understanding.</i>

651
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:32,887
He can be taught a few
simple tricks, nothing more.

652
00:33:32,922 --> 00:33:35,190
Dr. Zira: <i>I'm afraid
I must disagree.</i>

<i>According to</i>
<i>my experiments--</i>

654
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:40,495
Dr. Zira,
I must caution you.

655
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:44,566
I guess your stomach
is feeling better.

656
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:48,970
Why are you being punished?

657
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:50,839
I don't know.

658
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:52,574
Come on.

659
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:54,909
Because the wallpaper
didn't line up.

660
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,212
<i>...the simian nature</i>
<i>from a study of man</i>

662
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:01,583

All of America.

In the future.

672

Jesus.

673

- <i>( typewriter clacking )</i>

I need another half hour.

677

Oh, yeah.
Just a minute.

678
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,596
It's for you.
It's the real estate agent.

679

- Hello, Ginny.
- Well, we didn't get it.

680
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,504
Wh-- what happened?

681
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,206
Someone came in
a little bit higher.

682
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,041
But you know what?
It wasn't meant to be.

683
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:35,160
( sighs ) How much higher?

684
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:37,796
It was still under asking, Peggy.
It wasn't meant to be.

685
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,548
There's no other way to think about it.
Try, try again.

686

<i>( hangs up )</i>

What are you gonna do?

689
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:59,100
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

690
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:01,002
That you give a damn.

691
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,404
Peggy, this is
an emotional story.

692
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:06,074
Stop being such a martyr. You're
having the time of your life.

693
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:08,977
- Why are you so mad?
- Because I'm alone in this.

694
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:11,546
That's not cool.

695
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,681
I don't mean financially.

696
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:16,251
I mean, don't you care
where we live?

697
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:18,820
Look, I don't feel right
expressing an opinion.

698
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:20,789
Now is your chance.

699
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:22,791
I don't want to live
on the Upper East Side.

700
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:25,827
Fine. Why?

701
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:27,428
I don't know.

702
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:29,230
I saw us raising
our kids in a place

703
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:30,765
with more different
kinds of people.

704
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:36,404
This photographer
trailing me the other night,

705
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,673
he lives in the West 80s.

706
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:40,074
Isn't it dangerous?

707
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:41,576
No, it's more rundown.

708
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,611
But that's why it's so cheap.

709
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:46,181
Get some lumber, a coat of paint--
people are doing it.

710
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,152
I didn't know
you felt that way.

711
00:37:09,638 --> 00:37:11,339
About the Upper East Side.

712
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,492
I do.

713
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:18,663
I'm sorry.

714
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,748
I just felt it wasn't my money.

715
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:22,467
How much of a say do I have?

716
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:27,755
You're in my life.

717
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,791
You're a part of my life.

718
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:35,246
Peggy, I've got to finish this.

719
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,139
<i>( typewriter clacking )</i>

720

- Did you see this movie?
- Not yet.

721
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:10,999
Do you get to see it for free?

722
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,201
- I do.
- It's really good.

723
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:16,204
- We're seeing it again.
- You enjoy yourself.

724
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,125
Everybody likes to go to the
movies when they're sad.

725
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:51,305
I was looking for you.
You left the TV on.

726
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:53,524
I don't feel right
turning it off,

727
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:56,327
but I don't want to watch it.

728

He doesn't even want
me to come in.

729
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,814
Everything has settled down.

730
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:01,532
For the time being.

731
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,819
No, I think this
is the end of it.

732
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:08,156
Good.

733
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,591
Betty, I hope you know you'll
never have to worry about money.

734
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:13,027
Why would you bring that up?

735
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:15,029
Nothing.

736
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,731
I just keep asking myself,

737
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:18,900
- "What am I doing?"
- About what?

738
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:22,170
I keep thinking about
walking through Harlem,

739
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:25,807
Lindsay a few paces ahead,
grinning like he always does,

740
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:28,142
the rest of us
following behind.

741
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:31,079
- Wasn't that frightening?
- It was exhilarating.

742
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:33,481
But what was the cost
of avoiding that riot?

743
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:36,517
Police corruption,
disrespect for authority,

744
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:38,369
negotiating with hoodlums.

745
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:40,204
You can't say that
to the mayor.

746
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,723
He's never been more popular.

747
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:44,325
It's just, Betty,

748
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:46,678
I keep thinking I would
do it differently.

749
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,715
I want to do it differently.

750
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:53,818
And, well, they approached me

751
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,187
like they always do
when somebody dies

752
00:39:56,238 --> 00:39:58,740
and they offered me a seat
in the state senate.

753
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,528
Do you want to run?

754
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:06,381
Run?
It's a Republican seat.

755
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:08,783
It's basically unopposed.

756
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:11,652
- You'd have to quit the mayor's office.
- He'll understand.

757
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:14,255
You think I'm the first guy
sick of being in a flank?

758
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:17,625
I feel like I've been asking you
to do this since I met you.

759
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:19,510
Well, I finally heard you.

760
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:22,330
It's a stepping stone
to state attorney general.

761
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:24,766
- And--
- And who knows what else?

762
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,434
Easy, partner.

763
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:28,603
This is what
I've wanted for you.

764
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,204
Us.

765
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:32,540
I can't wait
for people to meet you.

766
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:36,077
You know?
Really meet you.

767
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:57,135
Everyone's in bed.

768
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,604
Gene finally
climbed in with Sally.

769
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:04,242
( sighs )

770
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:06,361
I felt better, but now I don't.

771
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:12,250
- Why?
- Because who knows what you're feeling?

772
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:13,985
I didn't know
what to say to her

773
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,620
except, "I'd tell you
to ask your father,

774
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:17,789
but he's at the movies."

775
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:20,008
I should have said,
"He's just drunk."

776
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,377
You're better with them.

777
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:26,765
You don't understand.

778
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:29,334
I do.

779
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:31,836
You don't have Marx,
you've got a bottle.

780
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:37,526
Is this what you really
want to be to them

781
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,611
when they need you?

782
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:41,530
No.

783
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:47,786
( sighs )

784
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,906
I don't think I ever wanted to
be the man who loves children.

785
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:58,363
But from the moment
they're born...

786
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,801
that baby comes out

787
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:05,537
and you act proud and excited

788
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:09,341
and hand out cigars...

789
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:15,514
but you don't feel anything.

790
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:23,572
Especially if you had
a difficult childhood.

791
00:42:27,743 --> 00:42:31,613
You want to love them,
but you don't.

792
00:42:33,232 --> 00:42:35,250
And the fact that you're...

793
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:40,038
faking that feeling

794
00:42:40,072 --> 00:42:41,706
makes you wonder

795
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,209
if your own father
had the same problem.

796
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:52,801
Then one day they get older...

797
00:42:56,088 --> 00:42:58,557
and you see them
do something...

798
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,761
and you feel...

799
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,450
that feeling

800
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:10,935
that you were
pretending to have.

801
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:20,462
And it feels like your
heart is going to explode.

802
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:53,144
That was faster
than I expected.

803
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:56,915
Are the things calmer out there?

804
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:04,322
Well, then...

805
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,424
have a good night.

806
00:45:02,715 --> 00:45:05,100
Hey.

807
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,153
- You need to go to sleep.
- I can't.

808
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:22,233
So why can't you sleep?

809
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:26,104
I'm scared.

810
00:45:26,138 --> 00:45:28,807
Don't make me sorry for
taking you to the movies.

811
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:30,609
No.

812
00:45:30,643 --> 00:45:32,477
I just keep thinking...

813
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:37,749
what if somebody shoots Henry?

814
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:47,726
No one's gonna do that.

815
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,629
- But they could.
- But they won't.

816
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:53,965
Henry's not that important.

817
00:45:59,772 --> 00:46:01,790
Go to sleep.
