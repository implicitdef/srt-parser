2
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,400
Hey, okay ...
now ...

3
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,000
let's go again.

4
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,320
Which one's this, number 9?
- Yeah, number 9. Bright eyes.

5
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
Are you watching this?

6
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,120
This, this is unbelievable.

7
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,600
Oh, my God.

8
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,360
Oh, my God.

9
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,960
How many moves was that?
- 20.

10
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,360
The perfect score is 15.
God, what, what are you giving her?

11
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,720
Hey, give me that video!

12
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
Chimp number 9, just one dose.

13
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,640
Couldn't I see you later?
- We're good to go.

14
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
I'm going to call you back. Yeah,
all right. Thanks, Bye.

15
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,880
112, it works.

16
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,600
On just the one primate?
- One is all we need.

17
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
Full cognitive recovery.

18
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,320
We're ready.

19
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
Look, are you sure you're
not rushing this?

20
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,440
I've been working on this for
five and a half years.

21
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,800
The data is clear.
We're ready, Steven.

22
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,160
All I need is your approval
for human trials.

23
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,440
Oh, for this, you're going to need
the Board's approval.

24
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,920
There's a lot of money riding
on this, Will.

25
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,960
You only get one shot.
- One shot is all I need.

26
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,880
All right. I'll need to see
all the research.

27
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You got it!

28
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,760
Oh, and Will ...
- Yeah?

29
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,359
Keep your personal emotions out of it.

30
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,040
These people invest in results,
not dreams.

31
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,560
Okay!

32
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Meet chimp 9. Here she's tasking at
what is called the Lucas Tower.

33
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,320
The object of which is to move the tower
from peg to peg

34
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,000
without placing a larger block
on top of a smaller block.

35
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,159
As expected, she was unable
to complete the puzzle at all.

36
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,360
Then, we gave her what we call,
ALZ-112, a gene therapy

37
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,360
that allows the brain to create its
own cells in order to repair itself.

38
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,360
In biology, this is
called neurogenesis.

39
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Here, at GEN-SYS,

40
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,000
we call it a cure to Alzheimer's.

41
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,280
Donnie, you get her ready?
- She's got stage fright.

42
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,800
Is that what it is?

43
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Hey, ape.

44
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
She's gonna break my arm!

45
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,240
Bright Eyes!
Let go!

46
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
Are you all right?

47
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,360
We're ready to move
on to the next phase.

48
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,640
Human trials.

49
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,400
Here you go, Bright Eyes.
It's your favourite fizzy soda.

50
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Come on, let's go, Donnie.

51
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,040
We should have her downstairs already.

52
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,960
Okay. Good girl!

53
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,280
Come on out, girl, that's right.

54
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
That's for you.

55
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,240
Got her!

56
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Jesus!

57
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,920
Donnie, open the cage!
Open up! Open up!

58
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,760
Going to sedate her!

59
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,400
No, no!
- Get the door!

60
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,680
No, no! Hold it! Now!

61
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,960
Call help! Donnie, Donnie!

62
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,080
There have been absolutely no side
effects associated

63
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,519
with 112, with one exception.

64
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,440
For some reason,

65
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,720
the chimps irises exhibit
flecks of green.

66
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,520
Actually, we first noticed it in chimp 9,

67
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,720
hence her nickname, Bright Eyes.

68
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,440
You'll see when we bring her in.

69
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
Move!

70
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,560
In theory, this therapy can be used

71
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,640
to treat a wide range
of brain disorders.

72
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,320
It's virtually limitless.

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,760
As are the potential profits...

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,640
which is why we are confident that

75
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,840
you will vote to approve human trials.

76
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
No, no, no!

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Jacobs I am begging you,

78
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,240
I am begging you, not to do this.

79
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,440
Look, it costs a small fortune to

80
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,760
run lab work ups on all of those chimps

81
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,560
only to tell me what I already know,

82
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
that they are contaminated.

83
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,800
There are lives at stake here.

84
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,960
These, these are animals
with personalities,

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
with attachments.

86
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,480
Attachments?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,640
I run a a business, not a petting zoo.

88
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,079
Find the most cost effective way
to put those apes down.

89
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
I can't do that.

90
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,600
You're the chimp handler.

91
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,760
Handle it.

92
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,840
Steven!

93
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,600
Well, that was fun!

94
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,960
They've taken the 112.

95
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,560
Board has rejected your proposal.

96
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,360
They've chosen to advance other programs.

97
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,200
Well, there must be something
that you can do.

98
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,640
Yes. There is, I could fire you.

99
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,880
Believe me, we talked about it.

100
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,240
We have five years of conclusive data.

101
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,720
Parade all the data you want,

102
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,880
you will never convince anyone
to invest another dime.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,320
This drug has the potential
to save lives!

104
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,360
Bankrupt this company, more like.

105
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,280
I swear, you know everything
about the human brain

106
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,040
except the way it works.

107
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Go back to the drawing board
on the 112.

108
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,440
Start again in molecular development.

109
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,800
Find a way to get there
before someone else does.

110
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,800
And, clean up this mess.

111
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,560
Franklin!

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's very small. She must have been

113
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,840
pregnant when we brought her in.

114
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,160
So that's why ...

115
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,680
She wasn't being aggressive.
She was just being protective.

116
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
She thought we were going to
hurt her baby.

117
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,520
I would take it myself,

118
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,600
but my brother-in-law works for security.
He'd rat me out in a second.

119
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
What, you want me to take it home?

120
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,160
I can't take care of a monkey.

121
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,920
He's not a monkey! He's an ape.
- Franklin ...

122
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,400
You know, it's just for a couple days until

123
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,680
I find a sanctuary. That's all I need.

124
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
Franklin, no!

125
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,960
Look, this isn't my responsibility.

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,920
This, this is company property.

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,960
Okay ...

128
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
I tell you what, Doc.

129
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,519
Jacobs made me put down the other 12.

130
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,240
I'm done.

131
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,200
Be my guest.

132
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Hey!
- Oh, hi.

133
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,000
You look beat.
- Yeah. How's he doing?

134
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,760
Well, he has good days and bad days.

135
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,160
Today, not so good, although he

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,360
has been quoting Shakespeare.

137
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,640
Oh, you got a pet?

138
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,880
Uh, it's just a temporary house guest.

139
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,840
Well, maybe that'll be good for him.

140
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Good night!

141
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,080
Hi, Dad!

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,360
Dad?

143
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Will! I didn't hear
you come in.

144
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,520
Today's the day, right?

145
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,160
You thought I'd forget?

146
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
You have a big test today, right?

147
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,320
Chemistry?

148
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,160
Hey, Dad ...

149
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,680
You want to see something?
- What?

150
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,920
What is that? Is he injured?

151
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,120
No, I think that's a birthmark.

152
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,240
"As for Caesar, kneel down,
kneel down and wonder!"

153
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,240
Yeah, don't get too attached.

154
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,040
He's a cute little guy, isn't he?

155
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,400
Where's my car keys?

156
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,040
My car keys, where'd you put 'em?

157
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,880
Dad, ... you a, you don't drive anymore.

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,120
I know that.

159
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,440
Here ...

160
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,280
Why don't you feed him.
Can you do that?

161
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,720
Of course, I can..

162
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,760
Will! ... Look at this!

163
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,240
How old is he?
Like, a day old? Two days old?

164
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah ...

165
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,920
He's a smart one, isn't he?

166
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,720
What are you going to name him?

167
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I do not know ...

168
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,360
Three years later

169
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,240
Right away, Caesar displayed signs
of intelligence heightened intelligence,

170
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,800
so I kept him. And, brought
my work home.

171
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,640
By 18 months,
Caesar was signing up to 24 words.

172
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,800
By age two,
Caesar completing puzzles and models

173
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
designed for children
eight years and up.

174
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,040
At age three,

175
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,400
Caesar continues to show cognative skills

176
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,880
that far exceed
that of his human counterpart.

177
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,080
Home ... home.

178
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,920
He completed the Lucas Tower in
15 moves, a perfect score.

179
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,640
I maintain my hypothesis that:
A. The green in his eyes indicate

180
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,880
that the ALZ-112 was passed
genetically from mother to son

181
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,160
and, B. That in the absence of damaged
cells that need to be replacing

182
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,360
the drug in his system has radically
boosted healthy brain functioning.

183
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,440
And, ...

184
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,160
he plays chess pretty well.

185
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,240
Dad!

186
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
I'm sorry.
- I can't do this, anymore.

187
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,840
He belongs in a home.

188
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,120
This is no way for him to live.

189
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,480
No way to live?

190
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,760
I broke my lamp ...

191
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,120
It'll make you better, Dad.

192
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,400
Dad!

193
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,840
Dad!

194
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,360
Todd, come inside for breakfast.

195
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,640
I'll need to keep track of
what I take from the lab,

196
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,560
although I don't see you needing
more than one treatment a month.

197
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
Something amazing has happened!

198
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,320
I'll need a blood test,
a scan and the dosage ...

199
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,040
carefully monitored.

200
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,960
Now, if I can sneak ...

201
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Will! I'm not sick, anymore!

202
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,080
It was nothing, Dad.

203
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,520
Caesar. Where's Caesar?
I want to see him.

204
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,400
Caesar!

205
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,319
Caesar!

206
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,280
He can't have gone far.

207
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,360
Caesar!

208
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,160
Daddy!

209
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,680
Caesar!

210
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,800
Get out of here! Get out!

211
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,760
Get out!

212
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,080
Hey, hey, hey ...
Enough! Enough!

213
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
It doesn't matter what you do.

214
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,960
If I catch that animal anywhere
near my house or my kids, again ...

215
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,440
He's not dangerous.

216
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,120
It won't happen again.

217
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Damn right, it won't!

218
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,760
Come on, Dad.
- He, he just wanted to play.

219
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Stay in the house!
Daddy's got you.

220
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,680
I told you not to go out without us.

221
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,160
It's okay ...

222
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,880
How bad is it?

223
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,040
I do not know.

224
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,840
He likes you.
- Uh, huh.

225
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.

226
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,440
Then, we can go get a treat.

227
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm thinking, ice cream.

228
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,760
Good idea!

229
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,000
You taught him to sign?

230
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,240
Just, handful of things, basic stuff.

231
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,200
What's he saying?

232
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,040
Nothing.

233
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,280
So, when do you think we should come back?

234
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,840
Well, you won't need to come back...

235
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,280
because, um,
the stitches are dissolveable.

236
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,680
I would just say, watch for
signs of infection.

237
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
Fever ... redness ...

238
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,720
Okay, what's he saying, now?

239
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,040
Um,

240
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
well, ...

241
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
he thinks that you and I should
have dinner together.

242
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,080
I ... know ...

243
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,400
Caesar! Come on!

244
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,720
Good to see you, again, Caroline.

245
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,880
You coming, Caesar?

246
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,680
So, what's your secret?

247
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,440
Oh, I can't take any credit.
It's in his genes.

248
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
I think you're being very modest.

249
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,400
He's pretty amazing.

250
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,360
I think you've built a pretty good
home for Caesar, here.

251
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,520
You know he won't stay this way for long.

252
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,160
He's going to soon grow into

253
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,920
a large, powerful, animal.

254
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,560
Come here!

255
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,680
How's he been doing?

256
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,120
Okay, I think.

257
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,120
I love chimpanzees.

258
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm also afraid of them.

259
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,039
And, it's appropriate to
be afraid of them.

260
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,200
Caesar will never hurt anyone.

261
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
He's happy here.

262
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,840
Yeah, I see that.

263
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,080
We can at least give him some open space?

264
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,400
- Yeah. That would probably be a good idea.

265
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,840
I know a place right across the bridge,

266
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,000
the Redwoods. It's a paradise.

267
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,080
Come on!

268
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,440
Come here.

269
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,720
Doesn't need a leash!
He'll be fine. Come on!

270
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,960
Just to be safe.
- Come on, Caesar!

271
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,400
It's the redwoods.

272
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,440
Caesar!

273
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,440
All right.

274
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,680
If I take this off you can
not leave my sight.

275
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
I'll never find you again.

276
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
Okay.

277
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,840
What's this?
- What's he doing?

278
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,720
I don't believe that!
- What?

279
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,040
He's asking your permission.

280
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,320
It's a supplicating gesture.

281
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
It's okay.

282
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,920
Come on, Caesar!
Off you go!

283
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
Look at him go!

284
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
Caesar!

285
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Caesar!

286
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Caesar!!
- Caesar!!

287
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Caesar!

288
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,680
There you are ...

289
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,920
Caesar!

290
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,360
Come on, Caesar, climb!

291
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,200
Go higher!

292
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,240
Climb!

293
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,680
Be careful!

294
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,000
Caesar, be careful!

295
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,680
FIVE YEARS LATER

296
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
Hi!

297
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,920
What's going on, buddy?

298
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,920
Give some love.

299
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
Come on, honey.

300
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,160
Is that a chimpanzee?

301
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,080
Come on!

302
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,600
Come on!

303
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,920
Caesar! ... Caesar!

304
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
Come on!

305
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,560
It's all right. Come on.

306
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,120
Come on!

307
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,560
Let's go.

308
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,160
Are you getting in?

309
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,880
Caesar ...

310
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,800
You okay, pal?

311
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,080
Are you pet? ... No.

312
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,360
You're not a pet.

313
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,680
I am your father.

314
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,720
What is Caesar?

315
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,200
Okay ...

316
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,480
Caesar, this is where I work.

317
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,320
This is were you were born.

318
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,320
Your mother was here
with other chimpanzees.

319
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,920
But she's not here, anymore ...

320
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,720
so ...

321
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,520
that's why I took home
to live with me.

322
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,880
Yeah.

323
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,680
Your mother's dead.

324
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,280
The thing is, she was given medicine,

325
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,760
like the medicine I give to Charles.

326
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,480
She passed it on to you.

327
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,160
That's why you're so smart.

328
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,040
Let's take him home.

329
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,040
Come on, explain it to me.

330
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,800
All right.

331
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,760
I snuck him out of the lab
to save his life.

332
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,760
I had no idea that the effects had
been transferred vertically from his mother.

333
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,760
But, since then, he's been displaying
incredible signs intelligence.

334
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,360
I designed the 112 to repair,
but Caesar's gone way beyond that.

335
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,320
Here's his IQ from last year.

336
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,120
Since then, it's doubled.

337
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
This is all wrong.

338
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,520
My father was on gone
this drug brought him back.

339
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,480
You never saw how bad he was.

340
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,879
He has his life again.

341
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,200
And, what about Caesar?
- What about him?

342
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,000
How does he fit in?

343
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,480
With me, ... with us ...

344
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,760
Listen, ...

345
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,360
I know it has been hard for you,

346
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,880
but you are trying to control things
that were never meant to be controlled.

347
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,200
The 112 works.

348
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,760
Do you realize how you sound?

349
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,120
All I'm saying is
this is a good thing.

350
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,440
Caesar's proof of that.

351
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,920
So's my father.

352
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,800
Caesar, eat your food.

353
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,480
Dad, are you okay?

354
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,280
Yeah, I'm fine.

355
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,520
Antibodies.

356
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,920
His system has found a way
to fight the 112 virus

357
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,440
so that it can't deliver its therapy.

358
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,680
My father's disease is going
to return with a vengeance.

359
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,200
Stop!

360
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Stop, right now!

361
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,680
Hey! Get out there!
Get out of that car!

362
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,680
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my car!

363
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,880
I said, get out of my car!

364
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,680
I'm a pilot! I've got to get
to the airport!

365
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,960
How am I gonna get there now, huh?

366
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,400
Answer the God-damn question!
What were you doing?

367
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,640
I have a car just exactly ...

368
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,200
I'm done ...
the police can handle it.

369
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,000
Stay right there!
You aren't going nowhere, mister!

370
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,960
You will pay!

371
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,920
This is your problem,
you make it happen!

372
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,080
Not through with you!
Stay right there!

373
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,240
Caesar, stop!

374
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,320
Daddy!

375
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,440
Caesar!

376
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,680
It's okay.

377
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,280
It's okay.

378
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,200
He didn't mean it.

379
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,720
It's okay ...

380
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,880
Hey, hey, take that thing off of him!

381
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,880
Take that thing off of him!

382
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,200
Look, I'll take him in, okay?

383
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
No, he's under court orders.
We can't do that.

384
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,760
It's fine! Let him.

385
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,120
Bring him in when you're ready.

386
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,760
Take it off.

387
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
Thank you!

388
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,800
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar,
... Caesar, Caesar.

389
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,440
Not right now.
It's going to be okay.

390
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,880
Let's just see what it's like
inside, okay.

391
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,920
Come on, Caesar.

392
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,680
Let's go.

393
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,720
Come on, ... trust me.

394
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,280
It's okay.

395
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
Go.

396
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,280
He hasn't spent any time with other chimps.

397
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh, we're used to that.

398
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,160
He'll be a little skittish at first,
but we'll integrate him.

399
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,920
You'd be surprised
how quick they adapt.

400
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,840
We provide a stimulating environment.

401
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,720
He's going to thrive here.

402
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,200
Come, let's do some paperwork.

403
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,080
Make sure you lock that door
when you come in.

404
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,720
Caesar!

405
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,440
You'll be okay!

406
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,600
Everything's going to be okay!

407
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,280
Don't be scared.

408
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,600
You're going to stay here, now.

409
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,720
No ... Not going home right now.

410
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,840
It's OK.

411
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,120
The longer you drag out the good-byes,

412
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,760
the harder it is.

413
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,480
Can I sign that later?

414
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,120
You'll probably miss him more than
he'll miss you.

415
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
You'd best give him a couple of weeks
to get used too the place.

416
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,760
Will, we have to go.

417
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,480
We have to go home.

418
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,880
Coming back soon, okay?

419
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,560
Just call ahead, before you do.

420
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
Hey, over here!

421
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,120
Hey, I can get you out!

422
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,760
Come on! Over here!

423
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,240
Hey, down here.

424
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Stupid monkey ...

425
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,080
So you? Come on, make it!

426
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,000
Court order hasn't been filed,
so it's not in the system.

427
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,040
Once it comes through,

428
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,440
it will take about 90 days before
you receive an appeal date.

429
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,120
90 days?
- Yes, sir, 90 days.

430
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,880
You'll be notified by mail.

431
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,678
Here's what's going to happen.

432
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,680
You're going to go back to your computer,
you know, shift things around

433
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,440
and you're going to get me a date for
my appeal, this week, you got it?

434
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,480
I can't help you.

435
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,120
All right, then we have a problem.

436
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,880
Because, I'm not moving until you do.

437
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,080
90 days, sir. Be thankful
you're talking about court dates.

438
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,760
You're lucky they
didn't put that animal down.

439
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,000
I promised to get him back soon, Dad.

440
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,680
Dad?

441
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,920
My father's immune system
continues to reject the 112 virus,

442
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,880
rendering the gene therapy obsolete.

443
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,320
His health is deteriorating,
and the disease is progressing rapidly.

444
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,600
I need a more aggressive virus strain,

445
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,160
a faster delivery method,

446
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,760
because at this rate ...

447
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
I can't lose them both.

448
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,720
I won't lose them both.

449
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,280
Hi .... Can we talk?

450
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,880
Make it fast. I've got a meeting.

451
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,360
The ten years you have been
running GEN-SYS,

452
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,600
how many drugs have come down the pipeline
that could save millions of lives?

453
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,840
That could change everything?

454
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,440
What are you talking about?

455
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,480
The ALZ-112.

456
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,480
What happened to you, Will?

457
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,200
You used to be the star of this lab.
Now, you hardly ever show

458
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
and when you do, you waste your time
and that of your team's

459
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,280
fixating on a drug

460
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,360
that, after what happened,
is never ever going to get approved.

461
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,400
The 112 is dangerous, Will,

462
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,840
and it doesn't work.

463
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,320
I treated my father with it.

464
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,440
It does work.

465
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,760
You did, what?

466
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,120
You did, what!?

467
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,400
Beat the disease, like we predicted.

468
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,080
Brilliant.

469
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,640
There's been a complication.

470
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,280
Well, does it work or doesn't it?

471
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:17,880
My father's disease eventually
outran the cure.

472
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,400
Oh, for goodness sake.

473
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,800
The immune system produced antibodies
to beat the viral component,

474
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,320
but it will work.

475
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,680
I've have already developed a virus strain

476
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,680
that I think will be more aggressive.

477
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,960
You think?

478
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,520
Just, let me test it.

479
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,320
You're wasting my time.

480
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,640
There's more!

481
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,080
The applications go beyond the disease.

482
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,200
There are indications that show the
therapy can improve cognitive functioning,

483
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,600
memory quality ...

484
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,960
What, what are you saying?

485
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,600
My father didn't just recover.

486
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,840
He improved.

487
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,800
You mean, increased intelligence?

488
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,240
It's not conclusive, but yes.

489
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,680
I want you, to start testing the
revised 112 on chimps, A-S-A-P.

490
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,240
Okay.

491
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
I'll give you whatever you need,
but get started.

492
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,720
Dinner time!

493
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,640
Great Ape, primate!

494
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,640
Go on, don't you know food
when you see it?

495
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,160
You think that's funny, huh?

496
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,880
I show you something funny!

497
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,840
You'll learn who's boss, soon enough.

498
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,160
What about his clothes?

499
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,040
What about 'em?

500
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,720
I don't know ... May cause problems
with the other apes.

501
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Good!

502
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,360
I counted ten apes, correct?

503
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,040
Yep.

504
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,360
Good. All the way to the back.

505
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,800
You guys are moving really quick on this.
What's the big rush?

506
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,280
First day back,
you're still complaining.

507
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,040
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.

508
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,519
This one.

509
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,920
He's very calm.

510
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,440
Yeah.

511
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,160
He's been through a whole lot of labs.
He knows the drill.

512
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,440
Could I join you, what's our progress.

513
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,960
Get him prepped.

514
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,760
Tighten your masks.

515
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,400
Pass me the 113.

516
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,760
Pulse-ox is good,
blood pressure is steady.

517
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,200
Perisol delivery, in place.

518
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,680
Releasing the 113.

519
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,120
We have a break!

520
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Franklin, get your mask on!

521
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,080
Got it?

522
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
Yeah.

523
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,160
You okay?

524
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,800
Yeah, okay.

525
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,960
Move it! Let's go!

526
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,640
Get up and do some exercises
you lazy baboons!

527
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,400
Intelligence results are remarkable.

528
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,640
There are no adverse effects.

529
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,800
Apes have amazingly strong
immune systems.

530
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,120
All right, keep an eye on him.

531
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,680
Okay.

532
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,920
Sorry about that.

533
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,960
These guys are more resilient than I am.

534
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,800
Excuse me a second.

535
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,680
He's good.

536
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,840
You're working late tonight.

537
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,040
GEN-SYS needs three more.

538
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,440
Hey, Caesar!

539
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,440
Are you hurt?

540
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,200
Show me.

541
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,360
Caesar, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

542
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,520
Sometimes, the new kid on the
block gets picked on.

543
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,960
Stay calm. What did they do?

544
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,520
That's bullshit!

545
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,480
What's the problem here?

546
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,480
I'm taking him out of here, right now.

547
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,680
Not without a court order, you're not.

548
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,960
He's not yours, anymore.

549
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,240
I promise, if I find out he's been
mistreated in any way,

550
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,280
I'll have this place shut down.

551
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,280
Go on ...

552
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,120
No. No, we're not going home,
right now.

553
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,760
I'm going to get you out of here,
I promise.

554
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,880
You have to trust me.

555
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,440
Caesar, you have to trust me, okay?

556
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,400
I think this visit's over.

557
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,840
Trust me.

558
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,840
You'll be okay.

559
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,280
Come on, move it!
Let's go!

560
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,520
There are hundreds of them!
Looks like you're own private zoo!

561
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,880
Rather like a prison for hairy dudes.

562
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,640
They watch TV?

563
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,080
We call it enrichment.

564
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,320
Aw, this one's so cute!

565
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,640
What's his name?

566
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,440
Uh, name's Cornelia. It's a she.

567
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,080
Oh, my God!

568
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,920
Don't get too close!

569
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,920
This one scared me half to death.

570
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,840
That big guy is called, Maurice.

571
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,040
It's no fun.

572
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,960
Here, I'll show you something fun.

573
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,200
Check this out!

574
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,400
It's crazy!

575
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,800
You shouldn't be in here.

576
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,400
Hey, you're next!

577
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,360
Come on, let's go.

578
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,320
We spent too much time in here,
as it is.

579
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,640
Come on!

580
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,360
Check out this guy.

581
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,280
Hey, Alan, he's a pain in the ass.
He thinks he's special, or something

582
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,520
Freaky!

583
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,240
Hey, come here.

584
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,800
I think he's thinking or something.

585
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,400
Oh, my God, he's got him by the throat!

586
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,120
Let him go!

587
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,680
Let go!

588
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,240
Are you okay?

589
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:23,840
Yes.

590
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,560
I told you not to get too close, man.

591
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,840
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

592
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,520
Some things aren't meant be changed.

593
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,040
You need to accept that.

594
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,240
Hey!

595
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,440
Hey!

596
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,480
What's going on here?

597
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,160
More 113 trials.
We're just prepping ...

598
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,800
Oh, no, we have to analyze
Koba's blood work first!

599
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,880
Franklin knows this.
Where is he?

600
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,480
He's out sick for two days.

601
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,080
Well, I didn't authorized this.

602
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,040
No!

603
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,560
I did.

604
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,000
We agreed to test sparingly
on one subject.

605
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,720
And, that one subject is stunning!

606
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,520
It's a virus. We don't know the human
related effects.

607
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,240
The drug works, Will.

608
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,600
Tell him, Linda.

609
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,600
For starters, Koba scored
a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.

610
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,720
Every test result verifies
its effectiveness.

611
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,440
No more tests.
- What are you ...?

612
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,440
Not until we have a better understanding
of what we're dealing with.

613
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,520
Look, I'll tell you exactly
what we do. Look ...

614
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,400
Give us a minute.

615
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,120
Excuse me! Put the ape
back in the cage. Be gentle.

616
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,320
Will, I'll tell you exactly what
we're dealing with, here.

617
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,600
We're dealing with a drug
that is worth more

618
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,760
than everything else
we are developing, combined.

619
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,840
You make history,

620
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,240
I make money.

621
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,800
Isn't that our arrangement?
- No! There are risks.

622
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,680
Don't you tell me about risks.

623
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,840
You give your own father
an experimental drug.

624
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,440
I could finish your career
with one phone call.

625
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,960
I'll save you the trouble. I quit.

626
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,200
We will proceed without you.

627
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,760
Look ... You do not know what you're doing.

628
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,680
These tests need to be contained.

629
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,040
You have no idea if the 113 is stable,

630
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,680
what kind of damage it can
do to people ...

631
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,720
Well, that is why we test it
on chimps, ... isn't it?

632
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,960
Dr. Rodman, it's, me, Franklin!
I need to talk to you!

633
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,080
Can you come to the door?

634
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,560
Doc!

635
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,040
Who the hell are you?

636
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,920
Get out of here!

637
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,240
I'm sorry, ... I'm sorry.

638
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,040
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me,
would you?

639
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,360
Well, ... I can't say that I approve.

640
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,080
They're not people, you know.

641
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,040
You gonna to let him go or not?

642
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,280
Caesar, ... hey, come on.

643
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,440
Come on, we're go home.

644
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,080
Home.

645
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,600
Come on, we're really going.

646
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,360
Let's get out of here.

647
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,200
Yeah ... Come on.

648
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,520
Caesar?

649
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,920
I guess he likes it better here
with his own kind.

650
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,720
Damn it, Rodney,

651
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,720
You leave the hose out in
the atrium, again?

652
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,640
What? No!

653
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,480
Come on! Let's go.

654
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,240
Come on, Get up!

655
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,000
Eight months after its launch,

656
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,480
Earth's first manned space flight
to Mars ...

657
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,400
I ain't dodging.
I'm telling the truth.

658
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,840
Yeah, well, if I've didn't
take the cookies,

659
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,640
Then, who the hell did?

660
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,920
I, I do not know ...

661
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,320
Hey! Will you two morons
knock it off!

662
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,640
I'm going home.

663
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,040
Covered in water and
therefore able to sustain life.

664
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,880
I get more peace in the
God-damned ape house.

665
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,880
Dad, I'm sorry!

666
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,000
Mr. Franklin, it's Dottie!

667
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,000
Mr. Franklin? ... Hello?

668
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,400
What the hell?

669
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,280
Rodney, get to the platform, now.

670
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,400
Rodney!

671
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,840
What the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?

672
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,120
Get!

673
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,720
Go on!

674
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,240
Get back in your cage!

675
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,920
I'm warning you!

676
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,520
Go on, get!

677
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,280
That's it!

678
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,760
That's what you get! ... Get back!

679
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,720
What's wrong with you?

680
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,920
Dumb monkey!

681
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,880
Take your stinking paw off me,
you damn dirty ape!

682
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,960
No!

683
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,200
No!

684
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,360
No!

685
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,960
No!

686
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,600
No!

687
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,080
I'll beat all!

688
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,680
Caroline, have you been up to
Caesar's room?

689
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,480
No one's answering.

690
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,560
Landon!

691
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,600
Will!

692
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,880
Will!

693
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,000
What happened?

694
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,720
He spoke.

695
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,320
What are you ... what?

696
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:25,780
Your ape ... he spoke.

697
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,179
What in the hell?

698
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,740
I don't believe this.

699
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,660
I'll beat each and everyone of you.

700
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,560
I need someone to coordinate
with the S.F.P.D.

701
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,800
Tell them we got a fatality.

702
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,600
What is it?

703
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,200
I know where he's headed.

704
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,080
Glenn?

705
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,200
Let's go!

706
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:10,820
Jacobs.

707
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,180
Mr. Jacobs, It's Linda
from Will's team.

708
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,020
Look, something terrible has happened.

709
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,020
Franklin is dead
from a viral infection.

710
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:19,860
What the hell are you talking about?

711
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,340
He was exposed to the 113.
It does something

712
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,420
to people that it doesn't do to apes.

713
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,780
We'll have to go through the city
and across the bridge.

714
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,980
Mr. Jacobs?
Mr. Jacobs, are you ...

715
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,060
What the hell?

716
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,100
I am Steven Jacobs!

717
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:09,340
It's full of apes in there.
I gotta get in the air!

718
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,700
We have to be able to destroy them.

719
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:16,180
Just, trust me on this!
Okay?

720
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,820
You might want to get your cameras
ready. Normally,

721
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,260
these guys are quit shy.

722
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,980
They're going the park,
on the north side!

723
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:10,940
Find the lead!

724
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,460
You gotta hold the button!
The button!

725
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:16,380
They're being led. These apes
are smarter than you think.

726
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,500
They've got a leader!

727
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,540
Do not tell them I am stuck in traffic.
Make up with something smarter!

728
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:16,980
Hold on.

729
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,780
What the ...

730
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,600
They're on the bridge.

731
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,800
They're trying to get to the redwoods.

732
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,160
SFPD, Police 1.

733
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,840
This is Air Ops,

734
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:48,360
Seal of south end.
What's the status of those units?

735
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,480
Ready to go, sir.

736
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,520
As soon as they reach you, block them.

737
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,620
North side, we're going to push
them right to you.

738
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,420
No problem.
We're ready for them.

739
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,340
The north side is blocked.
They'll never get through here.

740
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:23,220
As soon as they hit the gap,
we'll take them out!

741
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:26,700
You can just shoot them?
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

742
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,220
Good!

743
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:34,059
Turn that thing around!

744
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:35,780
Get off the bridge, sir.
I can't ...

745
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,980
You don't understand.
Get off this bridge, now!

746
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,340
This is an evacuation. Get out!

747
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,780
All the civilians, clear.

748
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:41,740
Please confirm.

749
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:43,460
Put these people off the bridge!

750
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,060
Stand by, city mounted units!

751
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,100
They're gonna slaughter them.

752
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,900
I'm gonna to get Caesar.

753
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,500
Will, hey!

754
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,940
You, be careful!

755
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:51,900
I gotta get to my car!

756
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,020
Get out of here!

757
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:55,660
Let go me! I have to get my car!

758
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,180
Push 'em north!

759
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,060
Get out of the way!

760
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,980
Hurry, we're going to lose
them in the fog.

761
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,060
Do It!

762
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,420
Where are they? I don't see them!

763
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,420
CHP North, do you have a visual?

764
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,500
No, sir, negative.

765
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,620
Safety's off!

766
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:31,540
Hold your fire!

767
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,540
Back!

768
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,140
Caesar!

769
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,300
That's him! That's the leader!

770
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:15,500
They're in sight!
Put 'em down!

771
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,500
Help me!

772
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,380
Help me!

773
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,600
Take my hand!

774
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,920
Come, come on ...

775
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,280
Come on!

776
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,240
Not you ...

777
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,280
No!

778
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,320
Save me!

779
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,840
Caesar!

780
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,720
Caesar?

781
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,800
Caesar ... I'm sorry.

782
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,100
This is my fault.

783
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,600
This has to stop.

784
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,400
This isn't the way.

785
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,680
You know what they're capable of.

786
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,320
Please come home.

787
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:54,640
If you come home, I'll protect you.

788
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,960
Caesar is home.

789
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,000
Okay.

790
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,120
Caesar's home.

791
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:31,960
Go.

792
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,106
