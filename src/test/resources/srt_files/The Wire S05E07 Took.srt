1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,350
Now they're on line.

2
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:23,084
- This is masked as Marlo's 
cell number?

3
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:24,650
How the fuck how?

4
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:26,450
- Spoofed to imitate
a call stream

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,118
like it's
a phone company switch.

6
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:31,383
We can put any digits in
we want.

7
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:33,684
Meanwhile, phone company
paperwork on the case

8
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,951
has the cell
we gave to Sydnor.

9
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:39,550
It's fairly basic shit.

10
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,584
- Now, stick to 
the script.

11
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,751
We don't want
any tell-tales.

12
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:51,084
Even with
the voice modulator,

13
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,650
you're exposed here.

14
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:57,017
Seven-baker-fourteen.

15
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:59,118
Bga, go ahead fourteen.

16
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:00,118
Fourteen.

17
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:01,684
I got a vehicle
blocking an entrance.

18
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:05,218
Four hundred pressman.

19
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:14,383
- What the--
Oh, shit.

20
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:19,151
Templeton.

21
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:20,517
Hey, you--

22
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:22,851
Where do you get off,
you sick little twist?

23
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,218
Sexual?

24
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,218
I'm not sexual with them.

25
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:26,383
I'm not abusive with them.

26
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:27,684
How dare you write
that in your paper

27
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:29,218
without knowing
nothing about me--

28
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:30,417
What?

29
00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:32,317
- Biting's not sex,
it's biting.

30
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:33,851
I'm not sick like that.

31
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,784
- Whoa, hang on--
Hang on, hang on.

32
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:38,717
- Maybe I should
come bite you.

33
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:40,250
Would you like that,
scotty?

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,984
I bet you would
like that.

35
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:42,951
Am I right?

36
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,517
You write about me
like I'm sick.

37
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,417
You're the sick one,
you know that?

38
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:48,984
Is that why you like me,
scotty?

39
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:49,984
Is that why?

40
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:52,450
Fuck me--

41
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,951
Yeah, this is Holley,
Baltimore homicide.

42
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:59,151
I need a trap-and-trace on case
oh-eight, h-one-fourteen.

43
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,317
Cell phone is in use
right now.

44
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,684
- I could come bite you;
you tell me how sexual it is.

45
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:05,884
Okay, hang on.

46
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,884
Who, where are you--

47
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:09,717
- Well, here's what's
happening now.

48
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,450
You humiliate me
like that?

49
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,650
You mortify me like that
in front of my father?

50
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,250
My father's father?

51
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,650
Listen to me,
smack daddy, crack daddy,

52
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,017
little baby whack daddy,
here's what's happening.

53
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:24,717
You ain't never
going to find them anymore.

54
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,617
You ait never gonna
see them no more.

55
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:28,184
I'm sending you
something right now.

56
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:29,650
You take a good look
at this guy,

57
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,817
because you ain't ver
going to see him no more.

58
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,617
Hey, okay.

59
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:38,084
Don't hang up.
Can we--

60
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:39,250
Oh, shit.

61
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,250
Did you get McNulty?

62
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,283
Just his voicemail.

63
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:42,650
Oh, Christ.

64
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:47,751
That was--
That was him.

65
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,650
Again!

66
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:51,383
Nice bawlmer accent.

67
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,218
It's my heritage.

68
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:54,751
- Has traced
the phone in question

69
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,717
to pier five
on pratt street.

70
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,851
All units respond to that twenty
and detain anyone present

71
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,350
pending the arrival
of a duty officer.

72
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,751
- One-baker-ten,
copy that.

73
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,017
I'm rolling.

74
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,650
- One-ker-thirteen,
I'm almost there.

75
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,751
Kga to all units.

76
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:09,851
Be advised
that we're looking

77
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:14,550
for a ten-thirty individual
on a cell phone.

78
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,218
- Anyone on a phone?
- Not that I saw.

79
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:20,218
Just some people
moving through,

80
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:21,517
but it could be anybody.

81
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,218
Let's just fan out
and take names.

82
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:24,417
Go down this road.

83
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:25,517
Get their names
over there.

84
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,383
Get everybody up
in this area now.

85
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:28,383
Stop.

86
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:30,851
What the hell is this?

87
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:31,884
- Hey, let go of me.
- Get your hands up--

88
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:32,951
Get on the ground now.

89
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:35,517
- Get your hands up!
Step out!

90
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,017
- Get everody over there
and get their cell phones.

91
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,584
- I need everyone to take out
yourell phones

92
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,317
and place them on the table
in front of you.

93
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,317
- Stop,
he didn't do anything.

94
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,584
What are you doing?

95
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:07,417
Sarge, we got him.

96
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,984
- Bullshit.
- I got him on tape.

97
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:09,984
- The goof
actually called.

98
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,517
- Yeah, yeah,
it was sweet--

99
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:16,717
Hey, what'd I miss?

100
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:20,517
- He went off
on a tangent.

101
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:21,884
Said he wanted to bite me.

102
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:23,184
- What?
Bite you how?

103
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,350
- Scott, are you saying
that he threatened to--

104
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,283
- Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

105
00:04:29,383 --> 00:04:32,550
Holy Christ.

106
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:19,218
- So are we partners
or what?

107
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,250
No, Clay.

108
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,617
I don't pick
so much as a single juror

109
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,250
without a full amount
of my fee being paid.

110
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,350
If you want Billy Murphy
on your case,

111
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,250
you got to pay
to put him there.

112
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,350
- I got a taste for you
right up front.

113
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,617
A good,
five-figure taste.

114
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,250
But you asking for me to pay
a winner's fee right up front,

115
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,383
and you know what?
I ain't a winner yet.

116
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:42,184
Right now, with the sword
hanging over my head,

117
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,617
I don't have the kind of
financial support at my disposal

118
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:48,184
that I would ordinarily be
able to rely upon, you feel?

119
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,084
- So the money boys
are laying off, huh?

120
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:53,550
- Oh, they thinkin' short when
they should be thinkin' long.

121
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,550
Shameful shit.

122
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,550
25,000, 25,000 more
when you seat a jury.

123
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,917
I don't work that way.

124
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:04,084
- I know you don't, partner,
I know you don't.

125
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:06,650
And normally, I wouldn't dream
of asking you to suit up

126
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:09,084
for game day
with my tab, as it is.

127
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:12,817
- 200,000 when I get you out
from under this mess.

128
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:14,951
And Clay,
don't fuck me.

129
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:18,484
Don't even think about fucking me
out of a single part of that fee.

130
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,118
- Oh, Billy, you talk
as if you don't know me.

131
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:24,118
I'm disappointed.
I am.

132
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,084
My brother,
let's be fair.

133
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,851
I'm providing you
with the opportunity

134
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:30,751
to go head to head
with the state's attorney

135
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,350
in a case that's gonna be
front page news.

136
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,283
For all that profile?

137
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:38,350
Sheet, partner,
you should be payin' me a fee.

138
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,317
- Seriously, dawg, for 20,000
cash to my campaign committee,

139
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:44,250
I'll get myself indicted
federal,

140
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,218
let you go to trial
on that.

141
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:47,784
Beat the feds
like a stepchild,

142
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,851
an' really make a name
for yourself.

143
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:51,851
Fuck you?

144
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,417
Naw, son,
I'm gonna make you.

145
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,417
Motherfuckers gonna be
wipin' they ass

146
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,851
with johnnie Cochran's
memory,

147
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,283
and carryin'
your business card

148
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:00,951
in every damn pocket
before we done.

149
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:02,584
no.

150
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,118
I already got more rep
than any lawyer would ever nee

151
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:13,218
why don't you save that
silver-tongued bullshit for the jury?

152
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,851
Right.

153
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:17,084
No, nothing since.

154
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,717
Alright.

155
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,684
- Me, barlow and kincaid
been sittin' here

156
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:26,784
like the fucking maytag
repairmen, growing piles.

157
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:28,717
Nothing, not a call.
Then, bang.

158
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:29,884
No luck at the harbor.

159
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,984
We were tracking the g.p.s.
Then it just goes dead.

160
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,250
Area of pier five.

161
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,517
Where's McNulty right now?

162
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:35,884
- He's over
at the newspaper.

163
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:39,784
- Let's hear
that motherfucker again.

164
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:44,784
Hey, you-- where do you get
off, you sick little twist?

165
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:52,684
- Sounds like some gearhead
from dundalk.

166
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:55,617
- And emotionally,
how was he?

167
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:56,784
He sounded pissed.

168
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,450
At you, personally?

169
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,450
- Like I told you,
he sd I humiliated him

170
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,717
by writing
that the biting was sexual.

171
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:08,884
At the end, he offered
to come here and bite me.

172
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,350
I didn't really
respond to that.

173
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,283
Okay.

174
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,283
Did he sound like
the same guy?

175
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,717
What do you mean?

176
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,717
- Did it sound like the same
voice you heard on the first call?

177
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:19,717
- Oh, right.
Yeah.

178
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,250
No, actually.

179
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,717
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

180
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,283
It was the same,
but this time I noticed

181
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,218
he had a real thick
bawlmer accent.

182
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:28,851
Real thick.

183
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,650
- You didn't notice
that theirst time, huh?

184
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:34,484
- I guess I did,
but I forgot.

185
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:35,817
Did I screw up
in any way?

186
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,218
- No.
Not at all.

187
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,917
- Listen, we reserve the right
to make this decision,

188
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:42,350
but that said,
would running these photos

189
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,450
in any way
impair the investigation?

190
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,484
I don't think so.

191
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,717
Fact is, we need
as many eyes as we can

192
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:49,084
looking for
this homeless guy.

193
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,550
- You don't know
where is guy is, huh?

194
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,283
He could be--

195
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,017
- Could already be
a victim, sure.

196
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:57,417
Jesus.

197
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,584
That's Charles and conway.

198
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,151
I wonder if he's a regular
out there.

199
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:03,051
- He had to have used
a different phone though.

200
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:05,650
Had to have been a cell phone
if he sent you these.

201
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:10,017
- That's true. But, again,
you can't print anything

202
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,484
about where
he's calling from.

203
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,283
We're trying to get up
on that cell phone.

204
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:14,484
- What should I do
if he calls again?

205
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,484
- Keep him on the line
as long as you can.

206
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,684
Don't spook him.

207
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,218
Guy likes to rant.
Let him do his thing.

208
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,584
You okay?

209
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:23,584
me?

210
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:25,218
Yeah, I guess.

211
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,751
- I wouldn't worry;
he's just using you.

212
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,218
He needs you.

213
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,350
- I kind of resent that,
actually.

214
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,784
Oh, I dunno.

215
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:35,984
It's workin' out pretty well
for both of you, right?

216
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:40,784
Gentlemen--
Thanks for these.

217
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:46,350
- Callin' Vincent
on his cell all morning,

218
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:47,717
he still ain't answer.

219
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:48,951
Ain't got time for this.

220
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,617
Re-up time
will come due,

221
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:56,218
we still ain't picked up
the mannitol.

222
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:59,218
What the fuck?

223
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:02,784
Yo, Vincent.

224
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,784
Where you at?

225
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:10,250
Manny? Manny?

226
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,684
Shit.

227
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,951
Omar.

228
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:27,250
- Why you still
alive then?

229
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:30,417
- He say tell Marlo
he out in the streets, waitin'.

230
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,051
Say this whole damn city
gonna know

231
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,118
Marlo ain't man enough
to come down in the streets.

232
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,184
He get the stash?

233
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:36,250
Yo, cherry.

234
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:38,151
He blew manny up
as soon as he got inside.

235
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:39,584
He was gonna do me, too.

236
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,218
- How the fuck
he get inside?

237
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,383
- Manny open up
to go on the food run,

238
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,884
an' this dicksucker
was right there.

239
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:48,051
He knew
we was the stash.

240
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:50,417
Ain't need to be told shit.

241
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:52,751
He just knew.

242
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:58,851
- Four key of raw;
flushed.

243
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,917
- Hey, yo, cherry.
You gonna untie me, right?

244
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:06,851
C'mon, nigga,
untie me--

245
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,550
Seriously, steven.

246
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,250
If you can't afford it,
that's fine, I understand.

247
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,884
And if you think this clown
is gonna hold me off

248
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:13,984
and keep the statehouse,

249
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,617
then I know
you've got to hedge your bets

250
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,051
given how much you're
waiting on fm annapolis.

251
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:18,717
But if you're gonna choose
a side on this thing,

252
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:20,584
please, do it early.
That's all I'm saying.

253
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:22,084
I hear ya, Tom.

254
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,517
You know what, I'm going
to write out a check today,

255
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,984
and send it out the door.

256
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:28,151
- That's great, steven;
really, I do appreciate it.

257
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,517
Can you, um,
can I ask you to consider--

258
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,417
- I'll double down on that
for my wife, too.

259
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:37,417
For your wife, too.

260
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:41,417
That's just great, really.

261
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,984
Yeah, thanks for going
the extra mile on this.

262
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,184
No problem, Tom.

263
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:49,650
Photographs?

264
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:53,283
- He messaged digital photos
of the possible victim

265
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,218
to the "sun" reporter.

266
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,984
I've canvassed this guy's
regular corner,

267
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,917
and he has indeed been missing
a couple days.

268
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:00,450
We got these photos
from the newspaper,

269
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,784
but we want to be able to
intercept any future images--

270
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,784
Hence the amended order.

271
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,617
Correct.

272
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:10,283
- Can we catch photos
with our city equipment?

273
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,450
Actually, no.

274
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,250
We're still bumping around
in the 20th century.

275
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,984
But howard county
has the right software

276
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,383
on a couple
of their computers.

277
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:20,383
You need two?

278
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:21,751
- Yeah, in case
one computer goes down,

279
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,283
we got the other one
as back-up.

280
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:27,218
We don't wanna Miss our shot
at this nut.

281
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,218
Well, good hunting.

282
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:34,017
Thank you, judge.

283
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:38,350
Oh, Ronnie.

284
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,851
You briefed your boss?

285
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,617
And he's calling the mayor,
right?

286
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:46,017
- And Rawls too,
I imagine.

287
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:49,184
- Ah, pretty little fella
gets himself elected

288
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:50,684
on a law and order ticket.

289
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:52,484
Crime doesn't go down much,

290
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:56,051
and then, a couple weeks before he starts
gearing up to announce for governor,

291
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,951
some wingnut starts
killing people,

292
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:00,118
taking photographs,
sending 'em to the newspaper.

293
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:01,218
You know something?

294
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:05,684
You may wanna check
the governor's alibi.

295
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:08,218
You know?

296
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:14,484
Oh--thanks.

297
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,184
- You couldn't
make thirty?

298
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,984
Twenty?

299
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,250
Ninety-two.

300
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,617
I'm gonna tell you
something.

301
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:29,884
There are a lot of people

302
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:32,218
who want Tommy Carcetti
to be their fuckin' governor.

303
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:34,684
And I can't imagine
what they're thinking.

304
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:37,051
Ninety-two, Norman,
in a single morning.

305
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:38,051
It is a new record.

306
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,617
- The motherfucker
killing homeless guys?

307
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:40,784
He grabbed one
off the street,

308
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:41,884
wrapped a ribbon
on his wrist,

309
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:43,484
sent a photo
to the "Baltimore sun,"

310
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,784
saying we won't
find the body.

311
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,151
He--what?

312
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,417
- The newspaper's
gonna run the photos.

313
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:50,851
Bill Rawls.

314
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:54,417
I need him
on the line now.

315
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,817
* you rascal you

316
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:03,350
* I'll be glad when you're dead,
you rascal you *

317
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:08,417
ah--aw, look at ya,

318
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:11,884
ya baby-bumpin'
motherfucker.

319
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:14,184
Look at you.

320
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,350
Let's go.

321
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,784
Deputy wants
as much of my squad

322
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,084
as I can wrangle upstairs
right now.

323
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:25,350
We're going large Richard
on McNulty's serial killer.

324
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:29,283
I'm worçing my cases.

325
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:31,584
- Bunk,
command performance.

326
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,118
The deputy wants bodies.

327
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:34,951
The mayor's spewing
over this thing.

328
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,751
I'm not going.

329
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,751
- What? You don't see those
on my sleeve?

330
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,218
Plain as fuckin' day,
Bunk.

331
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,584
- I'm doing police work
here.

332
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,218
In fact, I have a fresh angle
on last year's major case,

333
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,283
on which I'm the sole
remaining investigator.

334
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,751
So fuck your stripes
and fuck McNulty,

335
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,751
and fuck your
big-dick red ball.

336
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:56,218
If you can't work with that,
then just write me the fuck up,

337
00:15:56,383 --> 00:16:00,550
and ship my ass
to a trial board.

338
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:09,684
- So, for starters, alma
stays with the investigation,

339
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:10,917
and detectives
downtown.

340
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:12,851
You don't go home
without checking for updates

341
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,917
before the E-dot
and double-dot editions.

342
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,684
So the case file is McNulty,

343
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:18,951
with the rest of his squad
as immediate support.

344
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,417
Lieutenant d'addario's shift
will man the wiretap.

345
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,051
- In addition to
alma and Scott,

346
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:24,584
olesker will have
a column coming.

347
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,951
Fletcher, I want you
on homeless react,

348
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,017
also interviews with
advocates and experts

349
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:29,417
talking up the problem.

350
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:30,684
Melody,
you get on the phone

351
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:33,650
with the whitecoats at
clifton t. Perkins or wherever,

352
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,118
and work up a sidebar
on what it means

353
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:36,717
when a whackjob
kills somebody

354
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:38,250
and wants to talk
to reporters about it.

355
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,051
- Greg, I've been
scanning the casework,

356
00:16:40,151 --> 00:16:43,417
and I note that while there have been
numerous field interviews and canvasses;

357
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:44,884
we haven't done much
with background work

358
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:45,984
on victims and families.

359
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,717
If you could take charge
of that--

360
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:50,218
Colonel tomlin,
we're going to need tactical

361
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,717
to provide surveillance cars
and undercover decoys

362
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:54,051
where the homeless gather.

363
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:56,118
We need to be
in the street, proactive.

364
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:59,350
This case is as much about
preventing another abduction or murder

365
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,051
as it is about making
an arrest--

366
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:03,484
- Thing is, we can't work
this one with the phone.

367
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:05,617
We need to be in the street,
at eye level--

368
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:08,151
- We need to keep the media
as part of the equation.

369
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:10,283
This reporter
that's bn contacted--

370
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:11,383
He's in the middle of it.

371
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,283
That may be a way
to solve this thing.

372
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,884
- You're in the middle
this now,

373
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,917
so while we're still going to
present this as a first-person piece

374
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:18,917
on your latest contact
with the killer,

375
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,350
alma's still going to interview
you for the mainbar.

376
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,550
- Now, McNulty's preliminary
checks with shelter workers,

377
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,350
and a canvass
of conway and Charles,

378
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,617
indicates that our victim
is indeed missing,

379
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:29,084
but when we get
a full I.D.,

380
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:31,984
we need toun every connection
to make sure this isn't a hoax.

381
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,417
Chief, we're going to need to
pull bodies from district ops

382
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:36,350
to give homicide
their own surveillance arm.

383
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,617
And having had some experience
in the politics of staffing,

384
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:41,717
I leave it to McNulty
to pick the people.

385
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:43,118
- For once, people,
I am assured

386
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:45,350
that the resources we need
to work this story

387
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,184
will be there for us.

388
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:51,951
So let's surround this mess
and report the hell out of it.

389
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,751
This one's got legs.

390
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,817
- I am now told,
by the mayor directly,

391
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,550
that there will be
no overtime restrictions,

392
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,450
no staffing limits
on this case.

393
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,650
So put this case down.

394
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:08,450
- Police work.
Whaddaya know?

395
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:11,751
Good day.

396
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,450
Six g-packs so far.

397
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,984
New package be
droppin' them fiends.

398
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,851
Yeah.

399
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:21,051
Probably need
one more re-up.

400
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,851
- Career day
on the corner, hanh?

401
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,951
Step off, nigga.

402
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:30,218
- Hey, Mike,
check th out.

403
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,051
"certified
hydrotherapist,

404
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:35,051
"experience with
geri-atric patients,

405
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:37,218
sinai hospital
outpatient clinic."

406
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,417
Jerry who?

407
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,218
- Whatever, how about this--
"dental front desk,

408
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:44,184
high quality dental office
seeks front desk."

409
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:45,484
- What do they mean,
like furniture?

410
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,684
- Like a secretary,
I guess.

411
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:48,951
- Man, you ain't even
ever been to no dentist.

412
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:52,517
- "Huhvac maintenance
supervisor."

413
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:53,984
- What the fuck
is a huhvac?

414
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:55,784
- "H-V-a-c."
Maybe they spelled it bad.

415
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,350
"systems manager in
a deadline driven environment."

416
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,051
- Man, ain't
nothing there.

417
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:02,051
And even if there was,
you ain't sixteen,

418
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:03,984
and y'all got to pick up bug
after three--

419
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:06,151
- Hey, hey, hey,
hang on, hang on--

420
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,317
"exotic dancer,

421
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,484
"downtown financial district
lunch time hours--

422
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:14,617
Must be flexible
in body and mind."

423
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:17,951
Now we talking--

424
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:23,084
Heeeeeey--
Make it rain on 'em.

425
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,084
Make it rain.

426
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:25,184
Hold up.

427
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:28,017
Time out.

428
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,151
Fuck did I do?

429
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,051
- If we don't know,
then you do.

430
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:37,550
This is bullshit.

431
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,350
Yo, don't forget
about bug.

432
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,517
- As this is an ongoing
investigation,

433
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:48,051
I'm going to ask
that you direct questions

434
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,784
to the police officials
best equipped to answer.

435
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:53,917
These new developments in the case
of the homeless slayings in our city

436
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:57,917
are troubling and tragic
and unacceptable.

437
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,383
We are now doing
everything possible

438
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,717
to locate and identify
the individual

439
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:05,550
depicted in the photographs sent
to the "Baltimore sun" today.

440
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,650
We are endeavoring to protect
other homeless citizens,

441
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:10,017
and we are
pursuing the suspect

442
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:12,383
with every means
at our disposal.

443
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,650
I have made clear
to my police commanders

444
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,550
that they have my full
confidence and the authority

445
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,017
to employ whatever resources
they require.

446
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,283
And let mee unequivocal--

447
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:24,084
This man
will be brought to justice.

448
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:25,283
Thank you.

449
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:29,084
- Mr. Mayor--
Mr. Mayor--

450
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:49,118
Voice and digital photos.

451
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:55,017
He calls again,
you'll capture either one.

452
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,484
- I can do those background
checks myself, Jay/

453
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,484
there's no need to--

454
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,484
You heard the deputy.

455
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:00,484
He specifically
assigned Greggs.

456
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:01,851
- Greggs
has an open triple.

457
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:03,984
- And this squad
has your serial killer,

458
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,051
and the case is shit-hot.

459
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,517
- Jay, I don't need--
- Jimmy--

460
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:08,584
You are the point man on the
motherfucker who's now missing.

461
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,417
You don't have time to be working
backgrounds on the older cases.

462
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,417
It goes to Greggs;
end of fucking story.

463
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:19,484
Now...
What else do you need?

464
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:23,417
- I'm gonna need those surveillance
teams as this thing sprawls,

465
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,250
but for right now,
let me pull this guy's I.D.

466
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,317
As fast as I can,
figure what he's about.

467
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,784
And after that,
I'll have more to spin off.

468
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:30,417
- Voice analysis
of the call?

469
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:33,151
- Shit, I don't believe
in that shit.

470
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:34,317
Next thing I know,
you'll want me to go

471
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,151
to fucking Quantico
with this fucking thing.

472
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:39,717
As a matter of fact--

473
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:43,817
You don't believe in behavioral
forensics, Dr. Moreland?

474
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:46,184
- I don't believe in much
of anything at this point.

475
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:47,283
- Well, it doesn't
fucking matter

476
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,350
what any of us believe
at this point.

477
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,917
You turned on
the fuckin' tap, Jimmy.

478
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:57,051
They're finally paying
for police work again.

479
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:03,817
Proud of yourselves?

480
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,350
We're close to Marlo.

481
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,884
A week or two at most.

482
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,584
- How does it feel getting
Greggs pulled off her triple?

483
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:14,751
How does it feel knong that you
got surveillance teams out there,

484
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:17,017
and district units,
and tactical--

485
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,350
All of 'em chasin'
bullshit.

486
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,817
- We're gonna use the
surveillance teams, actually.

487
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,283
They're gonna help us
bring in the case, Bunk.

488
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,383
I n't even want to know

489
00:22:22,484 --> 00:22:23,851
whose picture you got
running in the paper,

490
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:28,617
or where that motherfucker
actually happens to be.

491
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:35,118
- Names and addresses;
whater you got.

492
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,184
Jimmy--

493
00:22:36,283 --> 00:22:37,484
Don't ll yourself.

494
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,350
Shit.

495
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,550
Don't worry, son.

496
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,517
I got you covered
on all this.

497
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:47,917
Listen,
one other thing.

498
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:52,317
I, uh--I'm getting'
my kid for an overnight.

499
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,118
Where do I get
kid's furniture?

500
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:55,218
Ikea.

501
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:58,650
Ah, see y'all.

502
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:00,684
Shame on y'all.

503
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,684
I mean it.

504
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:07,851
Trace lab.

505
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,118
It's Moreland.

506
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:10,684
You just called.

507
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:14,218
- I know,
and I'm callin' again.

508
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:17,717
I need the tracework
on oh-six-h-two-seven-one,

509
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:19,218
and I need it now.

510
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,984
- I know, he hasn't been
around to it yet.

511
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:24,151
Well, tell him I called,

512
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,517
and tell him
I'm gonna keep calling

513
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:33,350
until he feels
my fucking pain, a-ight?

514
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:36,350
Gift-wrapped.

515
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,784
Number one.

516
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,884
Fuck.

517
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:56,550
How the fuck do they expect me
to get this shit done on my own?

518
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:59,884
Broke ass department
ain't even payin'--

519
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:01,517
You okay?

520
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:04,450
It's fucked up.

521
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,884
It's all fucked up, okay?

522
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:07,051
I could make a red
go to black

523
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:09,184
'cept for these cheap
motherfuckers--

524
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,617
Whaddaya got?

525
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,084
- Good snitch put the finger on
an eyeball wit been duckin' me.

526
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:19,517
He lays up at this one girl's
place at athol avenue, right?

527
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:22,250
Comes in late,
but he leaves early.

528
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,118
so?

529
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:26,550
- So I don't mind sittin' on the
place all night long an' not get paid.

530
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,017
But it's a garden
apartment.

531
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,984
Parking lots
on both sides,

532
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:31,184
and if he decides
to park on the street

533
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,184
and walk across the grass,

534
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:35,118
he still has
the fucking patio doors.

535
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,383
Two more men do it?

536
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,717
Yeah, and two more cars, yeah.

537
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:42,184
- I got more bodies than
I can use on my serial thing.

538
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,751
Lemme make a call,
hook you up with two tac guys.

539
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:47,017
You tell 'em you're sitting
on a twenty that I gave you.

540
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:48,550
I'll write up the hours
under my file.

541
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,383
And you can do that?

542
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,817
Go with God.

543
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,017
- Can you make out
who that is?

544
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:11,751
Yeah.

545
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:13,017
Look at you.

546
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:15,951
Not even blinking.

547
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,917
Not that I blame you

548
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:24,450
after what this heinous
motherfucker did to you.

549
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,784
Still, this right here
is vicious.

550
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:33,684
I mean, whoever did this
had a real time;

551
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:36,884
now you know
what I'm saying?

552
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:44,317
Now, I know it wasn't you
because with all due respect,

553
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,984
you don't have the physicality
to do this kind of damage.

554
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:49,684
I mean,
whoever did this

555
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:53,684
had to be a full-grown
and powerful individual--

556
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:57,951
A fearsome individual--

557
00:25:58,051 --> 00:26:00,383
You see
what I'm sayin'?

558
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:03,017
You the murder police.

559
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:06,450
How the fuck
would I know?

560
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,250
- Is this spot good
for a stand-up?

561
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,450
- Let's go with
a wide shot on this.

562
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,084
- ...say they are hopeful
thathe renewed attention

563
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:34,250
to their son's death
a few years ago

564
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,417
will lead police to--

565
00:26:35,517 --> 00:26:37,218
Kinda formula, I know.

566
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:40,350
Anecdotal lede,
nut graf, best quote--

567
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,350
- It works as a sidebar,
but for tomorrow,

568
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,917
let's stretch it some, huh?

569
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:47,383
Really spend some time with
some of these people, you know?

570
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:50,817
What I mean is, sometimes,
the weakest stuff in a story

571
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,817
is the shit with
quotation marks around it.

572
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:55,283
You got a guy telling
how rough it is on the street,

573
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:56,350
it really doesn't
have much pull.

574
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,118
But if you can describe him
as he really is,

575
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,283
tell his story
in moments.

576
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,550
Look, tomorrow,
get back in the shelters,

577
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,017
and the soup kitchens,
and just be with folk.

578
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,884
I don't even care
if you file copy on it.

579
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:09,450
I mean, if something
presents itself as a story,

580
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,484
great, but if not,

581
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:13,218
just spend the day
being with people.

582
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:16,218
I'm not interested in what can
be quoted or counted on this one.

583
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:17,951
I'm interested
in what feels true.

584
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:22,550
- I'm in, thirty inches, with room
for price's stuff from the hall.

585
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,751
Scott?

586
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:24,751
Five minutes.

587
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,317
- We're coming up
on first edition.

588
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,184
Three minutes.

589
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:31,550
- We had him in that,
what do you call it,

590
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,917
rehabilitation--

591
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,283
Four times.

592
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:37,118
We're not rich people.

593
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,951
Henry's on disability.

594
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:42,484
- We get him out,
he makes all kinds of promises,

595
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:47,051
but, well, you know--

596
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,517
I'm sorry.

597
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:56,517
- The last time, we decided
we wouldn't be there for him.

598
00:27:56,617 --> 00:27:58,684
We knew he'd probably
die out there;

599
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:01,851
if the drugs get him,
we knew that.

600
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:06,118
But this thing in the newspaper,
this sex stuff.

601
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,951
The biting or whatever.

602
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:16,218
Jesus, nobody
deserves that.

603
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,283
- You see what I have
a problem with, right?

604
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,917
I mean, the first-person
is one thing.

605
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,817
I know he needs to put himself
in the story--

606
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,184
It's essential.

607
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,884
- But this business about him
being out there day and night

608
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,051
with the homeless--

609
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,051
I mean, this stuff
about sharing their--

610
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:31,784
Quote, darkest corners
with them, unquote--

611
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:36,884
- He's writing
more as an essayist.

612
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:40,084
- We've got a column
from olesker, front metro.

613
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:43,717
I mean, it's pretty powerful
without being purple.

614
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:45,984
But this stuff
that Scott's written,

615
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:48,784
it makes it sound like he's been
ling with the homeless for weeks.

616
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:51,650
He spends one night
under the j.f.x.,

617
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:54,118
another half day quoting people
in a homeless shelter.

618
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,184
It ain't exactly studs terkel.

619
00:28:56,283 --> 00:28:57,550
- You don't think the piece
should run as it is?

620
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,184
- I mean, we have him
interviewed about the call

621
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:02,283
from the killer
in alma's mainbar.

622
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:03,283
We have his quotes.

623
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:04,917
But the rest
of this stuff,

624
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:07,118
he's acting like he's
taking his life in his hands,

625
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:09,984
he walks another highway
at night?

626
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:11,184
I mean, this is
our fucking city.

627
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,550
This ain't beirut.

628
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,017
I respect your concerns.

629
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,383
I'll take the piece
and mo it as my own edit.

630
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:21,383
How's that?

631
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:29,417
Okay.

632
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,184
- And while they declined
to talk on camera,

633
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:36,051
the parents of jonathan boland
say they are hopeful

634
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:39,184
that the renewed attention to
their son's death a few yes ago

635
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:41,283
will lead police
to his killer.

636
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:45,584
For channel six news,
I'm Patricia--

637
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:48,383
Media's going crazy.

638
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:50,784
City hall, too.

639
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:53,751
But for once, we're getting
what we need to do the job.

640
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:55,317
How does it feel?

641
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,884
Forbidden.

642
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,151
I feel like
at any moment,

643
00:29:58,317 --> 00:29:59,151
they're gonna find out
how much we're spending

644
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,584
and shut us down.

645
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:03,951
You don't have all this
in your head yet?

646
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,250
- I just want to
go over it all again.

647
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,051
We finish voir dire
by lunch,

648
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:10,684
and then,
it's opening arguments.

649
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:12,884
- For Mr. Bond.
It's on him.

650
00:30:12,951 --> 00:30:14,250
- He needs
a strong second.

651
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:19,884
He needs me to know
this case inside and out.

652
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:26,250
How much longer, Lester?

653
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:29,218
- If Marlo has a code,
we can break the code.

654
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:30,784
That's a given.

655
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,084
How long?

656
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:38,550
Depends on the code,
doesn't it?

657
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:41,283
- Quicker we bring this in
and shut it down,

658
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,984
the safer
we'll all be.

659
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:45,151
I mean, Landsman wants me
to go to fucking Quantico,

660
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,250
let the F.B.I.
Do a profile.

661
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,817
- Might learn something
about yourself.

662
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:51,717
It's not funny, Lester.

663
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,250
This shit's bigger than
I ever thought it would be.

664
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,884
The whole fuckin' city--

665
00:30:55,984 --> 00:31:01,617
Yeah, Jay.

666
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:06,617
No. No, I don't need
an academy class

667
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:11,550
to help with a canvass
near this guy's corners.

668
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,751
Well, I don't need
any additional canvassing.

669
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:16,817
What? You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

670
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,184
Because I already know the name
of the missing smokehound.

671
00:31:19,283 --> 00:31:20,350
Yeah, his name,
his d.o.b.

672
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,817
And his last known address
at a city shelter.

673
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:26,817
Lawrence butler,
3/10/1951,

674
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:30,017
400 west street,
south Baltimore men's shelter.

675
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:31,650
- Well, how did you
get all of that?

676
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,450
how?

677
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,817
Police work.

678
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:37,650
When I have more leads,
sergeant,

679
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,417
I'll be able to use
the extra manpower you give me

680
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,484
and run this shit down.

681
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,684
But until then,
will you back off, Jay?

682
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:48,218
Yeah,
just back the fuck off.

683
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:50,118
Trouble with making this thing
into a red ball?

684
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,784
People started treating it
like a fucking red ball.

685
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,817
Jesus!

686
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:56,383
Get me out of this,
Lester.

687
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:59,184
As fast as you can.

688
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:02,851
- Senator--
Senator--

689
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:06,218
Senator, there have been rumors
of a last minute plea offer.

690
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:11,317
- How can I plead
to what I didn't do?

691
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:12,784
- What're you reading
there, senator?

692
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:14,751
This here?

693
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:17,417
"prometheus bound,"
an ancient play,

694
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,684
one of the oldest we have,
about a simple man

695
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,417
who was horrifically punished
by the powers that be

696
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:26,484
for the terrible crime of trying
to bring light to the common people.

697
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:31,584
In the words of aeschylus,
"no good deed goes unpunished."

698
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:35,584
I cannot tell you how much
consolation I find in these slim pages.

699
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:36,884
- One more question,
senator--

700
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:39,017
- Ladies and gentlemen, I do
believe I have my day in court

701
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:42,851
and I will see you inside.

702
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:50,684
- City hall
wants an update.

703
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:54,717
What do we know
about our missing mope?

704
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:01,817
What else?

705
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:03,617
- Sending a tape of the call
down to Quantico,

706
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:04,817
along with the case file.

707
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:06,250
They'll review,
then meet with us.

708
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,250
- You gotta hit every downtown
shelter or mission there is--

709
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,984
You want bodies for that?

710
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:12,784
I'm taking christeson.

711
00:33:12,884 --> 00:33:14,317
The rookie?

712
00:33:14,417 --> 00:33:15,817
- Yeah, he'll ask
the extra question.

713
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:16,951
He's hungry. He's--

714
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:20,917
I need more bodies,
I'll let you know.

715
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,817
- Heard what you did
with christeson,

716
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,118
letting him go
on his own case,

717
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:31,184
while you carry him
and two surveillance teams.

718
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,617
Your shit is right, Jimmy.

719
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:34,118
Thanks.

720
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,650
- So I got another one
for ya.

721
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:37,884
You remember
the rape-murder I had?

722
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:39,250
Bolton hill job?

723
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,383
Brother-in-law
of my rapist--

724
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:42,817
Last year
wouldn't talk to me,

725
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,450
but now, his wife
just got collared,

726
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,917
and if she gets locked up,
his kids go to family services,

727
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:50,184
so he's desperate to deal.

728
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:53,317
The problem is,
he's in the new York system--

729
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,118
Elmira, newburgh,
one of those places.

730
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:56,851
Anyway, I get a road car
and expenses,

731
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,283
I can put it down.

732
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:05,383
Jimmy, he strangled
a 20-year-old,

733
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:08,184
stuffed her
under her bed.

734
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,751
- Okay, give my c.c.
To motor pool.

735
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:12,650
I'll bury the expenses
and the o.t. In my file.

736
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,084
Thanks, brother.

737
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:24,051
- Ain't you the lil'
king of diamonds.

738
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:29,617
Homicide.

739
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:31,051
Naw, he's on the street
right now.

740
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:34,951
Call back
in a couple hours.

741
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:44,617
- On second thought, gonna have Norris
with me on that canvass today, boss.

742
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,517
- And with every single transaction
you've described, detective,

743
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:50,684
the money was routed through
the senator's personal account

744
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:52,684
and then
withdrawn as cash--

745
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:54,484
Yes, sir.

746
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,884
- Often
in the same amounts?

747
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:57,550
Often the exact amounts,

748
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,084
sometimes
slightly smaller amounts,

749
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:02,250
but always within a day
of the initial deposit.

750
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,884
- Thank you,
detective Freamon.

751
00:35:03,984 --> 00:35:06,517
Your honor,
no further questions.

752
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:09,184
- Cross examination,
Mr. Murphy.

753
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,517
- No questions,
your honor.

754
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:35,184
You got a number?

755
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:36,184
What?

756
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:37,350
Number on a slip.

757
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,984
If you get a number,
I might could find you a seat.

758
00:35:39,118 --> 00:35:40,084
It's Mac an' cheese today.

759
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:43,550
- Uh, no, um,
I'm a newspaper reporter.

760
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,751
- Oh, so you got
what to eat then.

761
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:47,550
- Yeah, came down here
just to hang out,

762
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,717
and get with
some homeless people.

763
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:50,984
- How come whenever
y'all be wanting homeless,

764
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:52,817
y'all come
to the soup kitchens?

765
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,917
- You don't serve
homeless?

766
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:54,917
Serve everybody.

767
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:57,084
Homeless, poor folks,
workin' people

768
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,817
tryin' to make it
to a paycheck.

769
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,550
Shit, half the neighborhood be
up here week before check day.

770
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,383
Hey, uh, you're not--

771
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,317
Homeless?

772
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:09,218
No, I'm down in
my sister's basement,

773
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,484
over at edmondson village.

774
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:15,218
What you need
the homeless to say?

775
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:17,051
Talk about the killings.

776
00:36:17,118 --> 00:36:19,484
The thing going on
with the serial killer.

777
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,383
But mostly, I'm just
lookin' for a story

778
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:22,817
about what it's like
for them.

779
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:25,218
What life is like.

780
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,751
Hard times out here.

781
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,650
I can't imagine.

782
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:32,951
- You gonna write a story
about what life's like, huh?

783
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,484
Bubbles, man.

784
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:38,051
Michael fletcher.

785
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,484
- Sticking for the moment with
the west Baltimore hoops charity,

786
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,051
what were your basic
responsibilities there?

787
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,684
I can't rightly say.

788
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:50,250
- Yet, you Drew $40,000 a year
as the executive direcr.

789
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:51,417
nah.

790
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:53,684
All at money went straight
back to senator Davis.

791
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:56,417
- Ah!
None for you?

792
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:58,584
- I got paid through the
district office for drivin' him.

793
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,151
That money I kept.

794
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,684
An' whenever I would
go out to snatch some money

795
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:03,151
- for the senator--
- Objection.

796
00:37:03,218 --> 00:37:04,250
- Sometimes
kick me back a few.

797
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:05,684
- Move to strike
all of that.

798
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:06,684
Sustained.

799
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:08,417
Disregard
that last comment.

800
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,450
This case is limited to
the charges stemming from

801
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,317
the operation of senator Davis'
non-profit charities.

802
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:18,151
Other matters
are not relevant.

803
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:22,051
Here it is.

804
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:38,317
- What the hell is that--
A meet at five-fifty?

805
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,151
I'm gonna go
get up on monk.

806
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,817
Hmm-hmm.

807
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:46,450
- You have a criminal history;
do you not, Mr. Price?

808
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,550
Yeah, I did some years.

809
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,917
- And when you last
got out of prison six years ago,

810
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:55,650
was setor Davis aware
of your criminal record?

811
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,383
Yes, sir.

812
00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:59,118
- And yet,
he gave you a job,

813
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,151
but today, is this how
you repay him?

814
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:06,383
The testimony you gave
about returning the money

815
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,283
you earned
at the senator's charities,

816
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:11,917
you say you repaid it
to the senator in cash, correct?

817
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:13,450
Every time.

818
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,584
- So there's no proof that the
senator ever received that money,

819
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:18,751
isn't that correct?

820
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:20,051
I guess not.

821
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:21,051
You guess not.

822
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,317
I guess not.

823
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,184
- Mr. Price,
you acknowledged earlier

824
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:28,851
that in exchange
for your testimony,

825
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:31,917
you received immunity
from prosecution

826
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:35,218
for any charges
related to this case.

827
00:38:35,317 --> 00:38:39,218
Is it fair to say that
testifying against senator Davis

828
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,951
ensures that you will not
yourself go to jail?

829
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:45,283
Got-damn right.

830
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,383
Mr. Price.

831
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:47,851
- I'm sorr--
Oh shit, sorry--

832
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,851
Mr. Price.

833
00:38:49,017 --> 00:38:51,051
- Okay, my b, judge.
Sorry.

834
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:53,317
- Mr. Price,
do you expect this jury

835
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:56,417
to take the word
of a twice-convicted felon

836
00:38:56,517 --> 00:39:01,151
over the word of a duly elected
member of the Maryland state senate?

837
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:02,784
What can I say?

838
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:07,250
Y'all can play it like
you feel an' leave me be.

839
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:32,051
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

840
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:33,350
I don't get it.

841
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,450
He hasn't moved off this spot
for an hour and a half.

842
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:41,151
- Alright, well, come
on back then, alright?

843
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,617
- Guy's been hitting
the bus shelters

844
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,417
every third
or fourth night.

845
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:45,984
We got two wounded
and one dead

846
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,350
going back to that piece
since december.

847
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:49,984
All I'm asking
is for hours

848
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:52,218
to stake this asshole out.

849
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:54,250
Guy's like clockwork.

850
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,417
Spot me an' garvey,

851
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:59,717
three nights
and the case is fuckin' down.

852
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,350
- I can give you
two nights.

853
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,350
- If he hits
on the third?

854
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,350
One night.

855
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,650
Okay, okay.

856
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:05,917
Two nights.

857
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:08,517
- You need to put
my c.c. Number on the ot slips

858
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,817
and you give those to Jay--

859
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:13,151
- It's cool.
I know the drill.

860
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,550
You do?

861
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:16,350
- You're doing good here,
boss--

862
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,283
What did you just call me?

863
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:22,084
What the hell is that?

864
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:23,550
Office reports.

865
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,151
Families of your victims,
debriefed in full.

866
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,717
And believe me,
it ruined my week.

867
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,383
Rough, huh?

868
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:32,283
- I'm sittin' there explaining
to the salt of the fuckin' earth

869
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:34,317
why their eldest,
who is living on the street

870
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,851
because nothing they did
could fix his problems,

871
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,484
but God knows they tried--

872
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,383
Why he met his end being bit on and
fucked with by some sick motherfucker

873
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:45,650
who used him
for jerk-off purposes.

874
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:46,951
How the shit
about the bite marks

875
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:50,017
get in the papers
in the first place?

876
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:51,283
Gotta run.

877
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:53,450
I got shit to assemble.

878
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,383
You didn't tell me that part
of it, did you, motherfucker?

879
00:40:56,484 --> 00:40:57,484
Who's up next?

880
00:40:57,584 --> 00:41:01,283
I got one at the corner
of calhoun and mosher.

881
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:20,250
- Jesus--
That poor guy.

882
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:22,751
- Wanna take him home
with you?

883
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:25,151
Shit.
Take me.

884
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:26,151
What?

885
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:29,784
- I'm just having fun
with you, man.

886
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:35,517
- Thanks for bringing me here,
man, showing me around.

887
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,084
nah.

888
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:42,817
Not about that.

889
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:44,617
Sure?

890
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:53,350
- Just--
Write it like it feels.

891
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,250
Fuck.

892
00:42:05,884 --> 00:42:07,717
Shit!

893
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:36,550
- Rodney, you can't press
a regular for his whole tab.

894
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,917
It just isn't done.

895
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:39,417
I used to run a bar.

896
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:41,517
I know how these things work,
remember?

897
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,350
- Gus haynes,
in the flesh.

898
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,751
Well, more of it maybe.

899
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:46,051
How the hell you been?

900
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:47,484
Where you been hidin'?
You in vice still?

901
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:49,650
- Vice? Shit,
that does take me back.

902
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:51,484
I did eight years
in homicide, brother.

903
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,917
Now it's the western.

904
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:55,650
Speaking of hiding out,
when you stop comin' round?

905
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:57,218
Last I saw you was--

906
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:59,650
- Well, I'm not running
the districts anymore.

907
00:42:59,817 --> 00:43:00,650
I'm an editor now, so--

908
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:04,951
- Then you can afford
to buy a round.

909
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,584
Hey, Dennis.

910
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,584
Let me pull your coat.

911
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,450
Long time, Gus.

912
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:13,584
Don't tell me you knew
I'd be here tonight.

913
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,584
- It's a cop bar, you know,
so, if it's not you,

914
00:43:15,717 --> 00:43:18,051
it's some other face
from back in the day.

915
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:20,051
Theoretical question.

916
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:21,383
Oh, theoretical.

917
00:43:21,484 --> 00:43:23,617
In that case, a double, rodney,
Gus is buyin'.

918
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,151
Two, rodney.

919
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,484
So...

920
00:43:37,517 --> 00:43:40,051
What?

921
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:45,584
- I seen you
at the stash house, yo.

922
00:43:45,684 --> 00:43:48,317
Ain't you used to be
with them Barksdale boys?

923
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,017
What they call you, yo?

924
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:54,884
Savino.

925
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:57,884
- That's right.
Savino.

926
00:43:57,984 --> 00:43:59,817
You ain't never
moved no dope.

927
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:02,817
You was always muscle
as I recall.

928
00:44:02,884 --> 00:44:05,617
Now you musclin'
for Marlo, huh?

929
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:07,584
I wasn't there.

930
00:44:07,684 --> 00:44:11,151
When they did the old man
like that, I wasn't there.

931
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,884
Chris an' Snoop,
they on that.

932
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,851
- Oh, I know
who was there.

933
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:19,250
So you innocent, huh?

934
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,051
Let me ask you
somethin' though.

935
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:22,717
Bein' that youuscle
for Marlo,

936
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:26,184
what you was gonna do
if you was there, huh?

937
00:44:26,283 --> 00:44:28,650
Riddle me that.

938
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:32,817
Yeah.

939
00:44:37,184 --> 00:44:39,383
You know what, yo?

940
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,784
Ready?

941
00:44:49,884 --> 00:44:51,650
Yeah.

942
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:53,717
A-ight.

943
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,751
Yeah?

944
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:01,951
We got to talk.

945
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,218
I'll come over to you.

946
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:04,751
hmm.

947
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:09,383
Does that seem possible?

948
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:12,118
To go through the court system
with a false I.D.?

949
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:15,017
- Maybe the first time,
if she's got no priors,

950
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:18,383
no prints on file,
but after that?

951
00:45:18,484 --> 00:45:21,283
B.p.I. Sheets have
fingerprint characteristics

952
00:45:21,383 --> 00:45:23,817
that are like
an F.B.I. Bar code.

953
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,584
And it's paired
with a photo.

954
00:45:25,717 --> 00:45:26,751
A name's one thing.

955
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:28,717
But unless||hese women
are twin sisters

956
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,584
and one's been carrying
the other one's hand around

957
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,951
in her purse
for the last twelve years--

958
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:37,951
Somebody's
yanking your chain.

959
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:39,751
It's definitely a code.

960
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:42,317
Definitely not having
much to do with time.

961
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:44,684
We're at a point where
I'm going to need more bodies,

962
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,951
surveillance cars,
man hours.

963
00:45:47,051 --> 00:45:48,484
We're gonna have to stay
on these guys

964
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:50,784
until those clocks
start to make sense.

965
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:53,751
- Well, good news is they giving
me more manpower than I can waste.

966
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,118
Bad news?

967
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:56,784
- It's all around the office
that I'm giving out hours

968
00:45:56,951 --> 00:46:01,017
and money to people
to work other cases.

969
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:02,017
I can't help it, Lester.

970
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:03,051
It's the kind of person
I am.

971
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:04,218
I give and give and give--

972
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,517
- You know,
if you're not careful,

973
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:07,817
you're gonna get shit on you,
on us.

974
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:09,151
Who's gonna complain?

975
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,884
Guys are working cases
and getting paid--

976
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:16,517
So what exactly
do you need?

977
00:46:16,617 --> 00:46:17,784
Seven men.

978
00:46:17,951 --> 00:46:20,250
No, eight.
And cars.

979
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,517
- Oh shit, they offered me men
from the districts,

980
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:26,517
and a surveillance supervisor
to run the detail.

981
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,051
- Anyone in the districts
we trust?

982
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:30,584
- Hmm.
Lemme think on that.

983
00:46:33,317 --> 00:46:34,784
Yeah?

984
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:38,550
- I don't know how the fuck did
you of all people do this shit, huh?

985
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:39,650
how?

986
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:41,450
- You got the right
allen wrench?

987
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,817
God damn directions.

988
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:46,250
- What kind of scotch
you using?

989
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:53,917
ow!

990
00:46:54,017 --> 00:46:55,184
Fuck!

991
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:57,450
Fuck! Fuck!

992
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,617
Piece of shit!

993
00:46:58,717 --> 00:47:01,350
- Yo, so you talked
to Chris, right?

994
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,984
What he say?

995
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:04,550
He didn't say shit.

996
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,084
He knows I ain't say
a fuckin' word to no police.

997
00:47:07,184 --> 00:47:10,350
- And you heard what little
dermell said to the juvenile master?

998
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,383
Lady ax him like,
"yo, you got a record?"

999
00:47:13,484 --> 00:47:14,851
he's like "yeah, bitch,
I got a record.

1000
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:19,751
My record's so long
I'm about to put out an album."

1001
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:24,484
- Uh uh uh, don't touch
that dial, young'un.

1002
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:32,484
This a Stanfield
corner, huh?

1003
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:35,450
huh?

1004
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,751
You know who I am?

1005
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,584
You make sure
you tell the boss man

1006
00:47:46,684 --> 00:47:49,751
that you know who it is
dropped savino last night.

1007
00:47:49,851 --> 00:47:51,784
Ya feel me?

1008
00:47:51,884 --> 00:47:54,584
You tell that man
I'ma drop all his muscle

1009
00:47:54,684 --> 00:48:00,951
until he get the heart to come
down to the street and dance.

1010
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:04,751
You gonna remone that,
sweetpea?

1011
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:20,617
- That's Omar?
Damn.

1012
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:24,684
Savino dead, yo?

1013
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:29,884
- Shit, man, if he'DA made me from
monk's apartment the other night,

1014
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:32,717
I might be laid out
my own self.

1015
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:37,584
Gimpy as a motherfucker.

1016
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:39,218
- I don't know, senator.
I want to believe you.

1017
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:40,851
I mean,
I'm your lawyer.

1018
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,717
But there's all this
up on the board

1019
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:45,617
that Mr. Bond
has on display--

1020
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:48,084
$11,000
to west side hoops,

1021
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:50,851
next day,
$11,000 drawn,

1022
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:55,550
then $11,000 deposited in
your personal banking account--

1023
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,450
- You bet
it all went into my account.

1024
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,817
It made it easier
for me to do my job.

1025
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,283
And at the end of the day?

1026
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:02,817
Not one penny
stayed with me.

1027
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:05,184
- I need you to do better
than that, senator.

1028
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,184
Where are your records?

1029
00:49:06,283 --> 00:49:07,184
Records?

1030
00:49:07,283 --> 00:49:08,517
Yes, records.

1031
00:49:08,617 --> 00:49:11,250
For example,
this check for $11,000

1032
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,184
dated january 22nd--

1033
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,350
That was last winter, right?

1034
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,917
So, some went to pay
everyone's b.g.E.,

1035
00:49:19,984 --> 00:49:22,717
'cause half my district was
gonna have the heat turned off,

1036
00:49:22,817 --> 00:49:25,118
and then, some went
for puff jackets for them

1037
00:49:25,218 --> 00:49:26,751
that got children in need.

1038
00:49:26,851 --> 00:49:28,717
Let me tell you
something, man.

1039
00:49:28,817 --> 00:49:31,751
My neck of the woods,
it's a jungle out there.

1040
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:36,951
Everybody living hand to mouth,
improvising, hustlin',

1041
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:39,550
make do with as little
as you can imagine.

1042
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,550
Hell, that, uh, that TV show,
what's that, "survivor"?

1043
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,283
Man, they want
some good contestants,

1044
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,383
they need to come
around westside.

1045
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:49,650
Folks I know?

1046
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:51,350
Oh, we'd do great
on that show.

1047
00:49:51,484 --> 00:49:54,283
Practice every damn day
of our lives.

1048
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,118
Hell,
and "fear factor"?

1049
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:59,317
Oh, sheee--
Don't even get me started.

1050
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:02,151
- Forgive me, but I still don't
understand how that justifies--

1051
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,517
- Let me tell you something,
brother--

1052
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,784
I don't know how they do it
out in Roland park--

1053
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:11,151
Maybe prosecutor obonda
can enlighten me on that.

1054
00:50:11,317 --> 00:50:13,317
But my world is strictly
cash and carry,

1055
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:15,784
and I am Clay Davis.

1056
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:19,383
My people need something,
they know where to find me.

1057
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:23,051
Let me tell you, brother,
I step out the door,

1058
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:25,550
hit the corner of mosher
and pennsylvania,

1059
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,584
you better believe
my pockets are bulging.

1060
00:50:27,684 --> 00:50:31,118
But by the time
I get to Robert street--

1061
00:50:31,218 --> 00:50:32,884
Objection!

1062
00:50:32,984 --> 00:50:36,784
Objection, your honor.

1063
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:39,151
- Senator! Senator,
take a seat,

1064
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,884
and refrain from off-hand
references to Mr. Bond.

1065
00:50:41,984 --> 00:50:44,250
- My apologies,
your honor.

1066
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,784
- But these charities were
set up for basketball leagues

1067
00:50:47,951 --> 00:50:49,851
in city rec centers,
weren't they?

1068
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:54,884
- Yeah, but you give me 20,000or
a basketball and an air pump,

1069
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:57,717
I am pullin' goodly on that
for whatever,

1070
00:50:57,784 --> 00:50:59,884
whoever comes at me.

1071
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:03,984
"senator Clay,
I gots to bury my mother,

1072
00:51:04,118 --> 00:51:06,084
"bail out my son,

1073
00:51:06,184 --> 00:51:09,350
"buy a new shirt
for a job interview,

1074
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,817
pay my child's asthma doctor."

1075
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:15,350
Takes me half an hour
to go a hundred yards,

1076
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:19,650
and excuse me if I didn't ask
that old Arthur-itised woman

1077
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:20,884
for a receipt,

1078
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:23,550
or that young mother
needed the similac

1079
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,517
to sign
a damned piece a paper

1080
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:27,784
so I don't have to be up here
in this box right now

1081
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,817
explainin' to folks who never
been in our neck of the woods

1082
00:51:30,917 --> 00:51:33,283
how things truly are.

1083
00:51:33,417 --> 00:51:35,984
And if a jury of my peers,

1084
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:41,017
you all deem it right and true
for me to walk out of here

1085
00:51:41,118 --> 00:51:44,017
an upright
and justified man?

1086
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:46,184
Oh, I ain't
gonna lie to you.

1087
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,584
I'ma gonna do
the same damn thing tomorrow,

1088
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,118
and the day after that
and the day after that,

1089
00:51:51,218 --> 00:51:54,283
until they got me laid out
at march's funeral home,

1090
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:57,218
and truck me off
to mt. Auburn.

1091
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,550
Silence.

1092
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:05,118
Silence in this courtroom.

1093
00:52:05,218 --> 00:52:06,450
What about trailers?

1094
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,751
Like fema.

1095
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:10,017
We set up trailers to act as
temp housing for some of the--

1096
00:52:10,118 --> 00:52:11,650
Some of the shelter
popution.

1097
00:52:11,784 --> 00:52:14,317
You know, put 'em down
in war memorial plaza.

1098
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:16,584
- Do you know how much
fema pays per trailer?

1099
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:18,151
- A dozen trailers
for the homeless.

1100
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:21,051
We've got three to four thousand
on the streets, at least.

1101
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:22,051
It's symbolic.

1102
00:52:22,151 --> 00:52:23,151
You know, we're doing
what we can

1103
00:52:23,218 --> 00:52:25,751
with a civic disaster--
Like new orleans--

1104
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,951
Abandoned by the state,

1105
00:52:27,051 --> 00:52:28,917
ignored by the federal
government.

1106
00:52:29,017 --> 00:52:32,484
- It's bad enough you want to
keep the city shelters open 24/7.

1107
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:33,751
That puts
the health department

1108
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:36,017
a couple hundred thousand
in the red.

1109
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:37,650
You add that to the overage
we're gonna see

1110
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:39,184
for letting
the police department run wild

1111
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:41,218
with overtime
and investigative costs--

1112
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:43,383
There's no choice anymore.

1113
00:52:43,484 --> 00:52:45,684
This thing has a lock
on everyone's attention.

1114
00:52:45,784 --> 00:52:47,450
When another victim
disappears,

1115
00:52:47,617 --> 00:52:49,350
we're gonna be
even more on the spot.

1116
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,250
- I'm just telling you, if
this goes on more than a month,

1117
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,884
with what we'll be spending,

1118
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:55,517
you're looking at cutbacks
throughout the agencies;

1119
00:52:55,617 --> 00:52:58,951
maybe even teacher layoffs
come the end of the fiscal.

1120
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,717
- Teacher layoffs...
- By a gubernatorial candidate...

1121
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:03,084
In an election year.

1122
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,417
Lovely.

1123
00:53:13,984 --> 00:53:15,617
- Hold up, hold up,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

1124
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:18,650
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1125
00:53:18,784 --> 00:53:19,917
I just want to say

1126
00:53:20,017 --> 00:53:23,917
that despite all the false
accusations made against me,

1127
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:27,884
the people who I continue
to serve have spoken.

1128
00:53:27,984 --> 00:53:30,517
What the fuck just happened?

1129
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,617
- ...as long as I can
to serve the people.

1130
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:37,517
- Whatever it was, they don't
teach it in law school.

1131
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:43,151
- 45 inches of Clay Davis
playing not just the race card,

1132
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:45,817
but the whole deck,
coming at ya.

1133
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,084
- Got it.
Thank ye.

1134
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:51,751
- Someday you're going to have
to explain all this to me, Gus.

1135
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:52,851
After watching that verdict
come in,

1136
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:55,584
I feel very white.

1137
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,650
- Well, start with some
James Brown records

1138
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:01,283
and work up from there.

1139
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,650
It's embarrassing,
ain't it?

1140
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:10,751
- I can't believe nobody had
sense enough to tone this down.

1141
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:11,917
The hype is bad enough.

1142
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:13,917
But what gets me is
that I can't trust the guy.

1143
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,383
I mean, I send him back out onto
the street to own his mistake,

1144
00:54:16,484 --> 00:54:19,383
he comes back with some
bullshit about stolen identities.

1145
00:54:19,484 --> 00:54:21,118
I don't give a fuck
he gets took.

1146
00:54:21,218 --> 00:54:22,817
Everybody gets took
now and then.

1147
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:23,984
I know I did.

1148
00:54:24,118 --> 00:54:25,851
- It's about
not owning up to it.

1149
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:28,584
- Gus, this thing with
the woman and the crab cake?

1150
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:30,151
You think the first time
you catch him

1151
00:54:30,218 --> 00:54:31,851
is the first time
he does it?

1152
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:35,118
- Lotta guys'll try
to duck a correction.

1153
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:36,151
But the thing with this is,

1154
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:37,851
he was standing
on an outright lie.

1155
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:39,317
And if he'll lie
about a correction--

1156
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:43,283
- Then will he lie to make a
story better than it ought to be?

1157
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:45,118
- I keep thinking about
that kid in the wheelchair

1158
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:46,650
out in front
of oriole park.

1159
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,917
The one that only
had a nickname.

1160
00:54:50,017 --> 00:54:51,851
A black kid
from the westside,

1161
00:54:52,017 --> 00:54:53,584
crazy for baseball?

1162
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:56,550
Basketball, yeah.

1163
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:59,984
Football--sure

1164
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:02,517
I don't wanna call
another reporter a liar.

1165
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:04,350
I really don't.

1166
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:26,851
What's the matter, baby?

1167
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,717
You can't sleep?

1168
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,118
Let's see--

1169
00:56:18,218 --> 00:56:21,917
Let's say good night
to everybody.

1170
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:31,017
Good night, moon.
You say it.

1171
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:32,017
Good night, moon.

1172
00:56:32,118 --> 00:56:33,550
There you go.

1173
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,650
Good night, stars.

1174
00:56:35,751 --> 00:56:37,184
Good night, stars.

1175
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:40,951
Good night, po-pos.

1176
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:44,218
Good night, po-pos.

1177
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,584
Good night, fiends.

1178
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:47,784
Good night, fiends.

1179
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:49,317
Good night, hoppers.

1180
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:51,484
Good night, hoppers.

1181
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:52,584
Good night, hustlers.

1182
00:56:52,684 --> 00:56:55,051
Good night, hustlers.

1183
00:56:55,118 --> 00:56:56,784
Good night, scammers.

1184
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:58,917
Good night, scammers.

1185
00:56:59,017 --> 00:57:01,417
Good night to everybody.

1186
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,417
Good night to everybody.

1187
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:06,751
- Good night
to one and all.

1188
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:11,218
Good night to one and all.
