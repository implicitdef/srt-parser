00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,583
Daddy, please! You're not helping!

3
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:32,460
I looked into his eyes.
Not the eyes of a man.

4
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,878
The eyes of a coward.

5
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:38,713
(speaking in Thai again)

6
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:43,340
Excuse me!

7
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,467
- Bill!
- Tracy!

8
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:51,135
- I'm sorry!
- Where the hell are you?

9
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,512
It happened again!

10
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:57,221
Don't say that, please!

11
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,639
No this time we really fucked up.

12
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,349
Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

13
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:05,475
So much Trace, I don't even know
where to begin.

14
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,935
Oh god! How bad?

15
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:12,479
- Like, no wedding bad?
- Yeah...

16
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,064
a little worse than that.

17
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:22,483
THE HANGOVER PART II

18
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,025
ONE WEEK EARLIER

19
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:58,027
Uh, huh.

20
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:02,487
- You really need to floss more.
- Fuck that! That's why I come here.

21
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:06,365
- Then you should come more than once every two years!
- Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

22
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:09,157
I never charge you a dime, Phil!

23
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,867
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Ah, you don't actually.

24
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,575
Come on! Just one hit!

25
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:18,244
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

26
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:22,455
Yeah, actually. You're getting married
in Thailand.

27
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:26,082
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.
That's two grand right there.

28
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:30,083
Then my mother in laws watching the kids. So
now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

29
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,043
Plus, takes five days to get there.

30
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:35,586
It's a 16 hour flight. And it's beautiful
when you get there.

31
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,962
- Whatever, it's a hassle!
- It is kinda far.

32
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:40,380
Lauren's been there a week and she's
still jet lagged.

33
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,048
But it's where her parents are from and
it means a lot to them.

34
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:46,299
Who gives a shit about her parents!
Her dad hates you!

35
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,925
He doesn't hate me! He's just never
spoken to me...

36
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:51,468
...I think it's a cultural thing.

37
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,302
Why can't you just get married in Vegas like
you did the last time. It's so much easier.

38
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:57,095
Why can't you just be excited for me?

39
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:01,764
This is my wedding!

40
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:08,601
- You're really happy, huh?
- I really am.

41
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,103
Alright...

42
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,729
...I'm happy too.

43
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,397
- Thank you!
- Gonna be fun.

44
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:25,066
Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

45
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:42,199
- Thank you. You know that's a felony right?
- Fuck you, man!

46
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:47,118
- Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep.

47
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:49,953
- Oh my god, I just realized.
- What?

48
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:52,954
- I forgot to renew my passport!
- Oh no...

49
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:56,957
Good thing I did it last week. It's in
the kitchen drawer.

50
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,166
- You're the best!
- Hey! We're a team!

51
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:04,835
You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

52
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:07,086
Thank you!

53
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:11,296
- So I know you're not gonna get mad.
- Mad? What, mad at what?

54
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:14,714
Alan found out that we're going to
Thailand for Stu's wedding.

55
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:18,258
- So?
- So he's heart broken Doug. You guys are like his family!

56
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:21,175
No. Your family is like his family.

57
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:24,260
All Alan talks about is the three of you.

58
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,262
- And that weekend.
- Wait a second...

59
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,555
- Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up?
- He does that when he's upset.

60
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:33,139
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

61
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,642
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

62
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:41,393
For me...

63
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:43,769
No fucking way! Absolutely not!

64
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:46,645
Come on Stu, it's killing him.

65
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:50,522
Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

66
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:53,316
I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

67
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,442
Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

68
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:57,442
I consider Alan to be insane.

69
00:06:57,442 --> 00:07:00,818
Stu, throw him a bone! We've already said he's got to
pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

70
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:03,779
You know what. We should see if we can squeeze
the old man to cover the bachelor party.

71
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,946
- That's good.
- I'm glad you brought that up.

72
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:10,323
- Because... this is the bachelor party!
- What?

73
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:13,407
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

74
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:18,035
Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes... a
lap dance from the waitress...

75
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:23,079
That's bullshit! You can't just skip
out of a bachelor party, Stu.

76
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,830
You see that? That's orange juice with
a napkin on top.

77
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,498
Do you know why? So nobody will refuse me.

78
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:32,292
Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe
at a bachelor party?

79
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:36,961
- C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting?
- No, I don't.

80
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:41,546
I'm still putting the pieces of my broken
psyche back together.

81
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:46,756
And you know what the glue is? Lauren!
I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

82
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:50,675
- Oh, please. You wouldn't even be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.

83
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,258
Stu, think about it!

84
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:55,302
You ended up ditching Melissa, and two years later
you met your true soul mate.

85
00:07:55,302 --> 00:08:00,012
You take Vegas out of that equation, you
would have married a cunt.

86
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,430
Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's
a bachelor party.

87
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,931
Drink up everybody.

88
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,849
Oh wait, there's no alcohol! I forgot
we're at a fuckin IHOP!

89
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,934
Well it's my decision and it's final, so...
how bout a toast?

90
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,394
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

91
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,894
- C'mon Phil, where you going?
- Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

92
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,937
He's getting married in Thailand! That's
great for him, but what about us?

93
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:22,356
You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

94
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:26,650
Shame on you!

95
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,401
Don't worry Stu. I will stand up for you
no matter what.

96
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,652
Thank you.

97
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:35,279
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

98
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:38,196
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

99
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:41,657
Alan's been waiting for the invite ever
since he got word of the wedding.

100
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:42,948
- I'm sure he has.
- Yeah.

101
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:46,034
Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

102
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:48,577
- Well that's tough.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:52,286
I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

104
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:55,537
He really needs this.

105
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,331
What?

106
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:01,374
Sweetie, papa! You have visitors!
Go in slowly.

107
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:06,043
Give him a chance to acclimate.

108
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:10,837
- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

109
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:14,255
Hey, bud!

110
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:18,924
- You guys wanna come in?
- Sure. Absolutely.

111
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,884
- Hey.
- Hey.

112
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:27,553
- Hey, Stu!
- Ok. See you on the court in half...

113
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:32,180
- Pretty cool room, Alan!
- Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

114
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,849
Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed
to delete these!

115
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:37,682
You made a promise!

116
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,141
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

117
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:43,810
What the hell? I'm not cool with this
at all. You can't have these.

118
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:46,102
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

119
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:50,731
- A total violation of trust!
- Mother I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

120
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:53,273
I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.

121
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:56,191
- I can't believe you guys stopped by. This is really cool.
- Wait a second!

122
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:59,567
- Al, is that Mr. Chow?
- Yeah. We still keep in touch.

123
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:00,610
Stu!

124
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,111
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

125
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:04,987
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

126
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,946
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

127
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,863
He's actually quite charming.

128
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:11,989
- Alan, he's a criminal.
- Excuse me, boys!

129
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,699
- Hi, Linda!
- Hi, Dougie!

130
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:16,117
I guess we don't do desert anymore. I
didn't get that memo.

131
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,118
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

132
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,494
Would a cupcake kill you?

133
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:25,537
- You know, I don't think this was a good idea.
- Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

134
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,414
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

135
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:32,290
- Well only if you're not busy.
- Stu!

136
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,667
Well maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

137
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,668
Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

138
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:43,337
Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me?

139
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:51,216
Yeah why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

140
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:55,260
- Phil, are you going?
- Of course!

141
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,804
Then it will be fun.

142
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:07,016
What the fuck are you doing, man?

143
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:10,684
It's my immunizations. It's the last day
I can do it.

144
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:13,017
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

145
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:15,645
I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

146
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:20,312
Stu, look at this!
I bought this cause I thought of you!

147
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:57,163
- Hey, there he is!
- Hey, Stu!

148
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:01,498
- Teddy! What's up? How are ya?
- Hey Stu.

149
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:04,666
- Alright. Who's this guy, Stu?
- This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

150
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,626
Goes to Stanford. Pre-med. This is
Phil, Alan and Doug.

151
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,876
Hey, nice to meet you, man!

152
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:11,128
Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

153
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:15,588
- He's 17. Kind of a genius.
- Actually, I'm 16.

154
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:18,882
I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take
the entrance exams early.

155
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:21,174
Because you're a genius.

156
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,217
- So what are you, a doctor?
- No, not yet. I'm premed.

157
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:27,635
- Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:30,970
- Well, he turned out to be a gay.
- Alan.

159
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,929
It's true, I read it in Teen People.

160
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:37,432
Right, ok... well I'm gonna grab a book or something
for the plane. You guys want anything?

161
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:40,642
- No, thanks. I'm good.
- I would actually love a small water.

162
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:44,059
Cool.

163
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,895
- What's the matter with you. He's 16 years old.
- Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

164
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm a little confused. Is he here just to
see us off or what. How does this work?

165
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,648
- How does what work?
- Is that person coming to the wedding?

166
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:59,317
Yes Alan. My brides little brother is
coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

167
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:04,860
Well, it's the first time I've heard of it.
You could have paged me.

168
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,572
Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

169
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:16,740
- Hey. Mind if I sit?
- Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

170
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,742
- There's no wolfpack, Alan. C'mon.
- It's no problem. I'll find...

171
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:24,077
- Teddy, don't be ridiculous! You're sitting here!
- Careful, that's a Louis...

172
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:28,705
That is a Louis Vuitton!

173
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:39,960
- That's a nice neck roll!
- Thanks! You can use it if you want.

174
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:46,004
Ok.

175
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,798
The Downeaster 'Alexa'" by Billy Joel playing

176
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:54,244
Baby!

177
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:08,709
This is so absolutely beautiful!
Thank you much!

178
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,042
Of course.

179
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:14,669
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited.
Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

180
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:19,214
You have to realize that in my country we
don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

181
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:20,880
Dad...

182
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,923
Ok.

183
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:26,634
Anyway I have to go and talk to Teddy
about his cello performance tonight.

184
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,760
Ouch!

185
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,427
I'm so sorry...

186
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:33,095
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your
brother, isn't he?

187
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:37,430
Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's
always been that way.

188
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,766
He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

189
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:44,350
You can just fax it over to me. I'll
pick it up at the concierge.

190
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,726
Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

191
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,769
That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

192
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,979
We were discussing your wedding gift.
He's sparing no expense.

193
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:55,938
Oh... That's so unnecessary.

194
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,815
I've been meaning to ask someone. I
notice this is a fishing village.

195
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,774
Is there a Long John Silver's on
the island?

196
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:03,734
You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

197
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:07,528
But, we are actually serving some
great fresh seafood.

198
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:10,028
- Better than Long John's?
- Yes.

199
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:14,781
- I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening.
- You too. Ok.

200
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:53,840
All right!

201
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:59,051
Thank you, Teddy!

202
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,094
The hands of a brilliant musician!

203
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:06,638
And one day, a great surgeon.

204
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:08,847
I admit it...

205
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:13,516
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

206
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:18,477
He seemed unattractive. He lacked
intelligence and imagination.

207
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:24,771
He was missing the spark you look for
in a man.

208
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,565
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

209
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:33,108
It reminded me of my sweet brother,
Chai Yo.

210
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:37,777
For those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning
the sailboat and lives in a group home.

211
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:44,322
But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

212
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:48,991
And that's when I realized, Stu is "khao".

213
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,659
What is "khao"?

214
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:56,535
"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

215
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,828
It has no taste.

216
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:03,456
We feed it to small baby and uh, very
old people.

217
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:07,124
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

218
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:11,834
The world needs "khao", just as the
world needs people like Stu.

219
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:19,296
To my sweet daughter and Stu!
Congratulations!

220
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:23,965
Cheers!

221
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:28,883
And now I believe that Teddy has
something to say.

222
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,761
Sit down! I got this.
Sit down, boy!

223
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:36,720
That was a.. a great speech, sir!

224
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,431
I like the comparison between
Stu and rice.

225
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:46,768
I've also prepared a few words.

226
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,518
Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

227
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:53,103
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

228
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:55,604
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

229
00:18:55,604 --> 00:18:59,356
It's chief exports are textiles, footwear
and rice.

230
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:04,025
Each year approximately 13,000 people are
killed in car accidents in Thailand.

231
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,192
- The climate in Thailand...
- Alan!

232
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:11,903
- Why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy.
- Okay. Sorry!

233
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,698
None of you know Stu like I do.

234
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:22,367
Not you... not you... not you...

235
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:27,911
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

236
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:30,162
No one!

237
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:33,746
I can't even tell you what we've been
through cause we made a pact.

238
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:36,081
More important than blood.

239
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:40,708
What I can tell you is this. This is
not Stu's first marriage.

240
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,377
There was a whore in Las Vegas
a couple of years ago.

241
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:48,295
Sit down...

242
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:52,923
- Enough! He'll get over it!
- Okay. Thanks, Phil!

243
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:05,719
In your face!

244
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,597
Well that was exactly as painful as I
expected it to be.

245
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:12,640
Sorry...

246
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,933
- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing?
- HaHa. Very funny!

247
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,392
Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

248
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:21,769
Get over it! He's your father in law. He's
supposed to hate you.

249
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:24,062
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

250
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:28,730
You know... I'm really exhausted. We're
just gonna go upstairs and crash.

251
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,940
C'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He's
gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

252
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,775
That sounds fun!

253
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,776
- Nyah... I'm good.
- He's tired!

254
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:40,860
Stu, one drink with your friends who
came all this way.

255
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,945
- I just wanna hang out with you!
- Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

256
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:48,197
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to
have any fun.

257
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,741
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

258
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:53,659
- Alright. One drink!
- Perfect.

259
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:55,534
- See you later.
- Have fun!

260
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:58,578
- You have the key?
- Yep, got it right here!

261
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:03,205
I'll see you in 20 minutes!

262
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,082
My uncle Roger said that he once saw
an albino polar bear.

263
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:11,751
Really? Polar bears are white.
How would he know if it's an albino?

264
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:17,169
This one was black.

265
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,880
Did you ever think maybe it was
just a black bear?

266
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:25,381
Whatever...

267
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:29,550
Ok. Here we go. American beer.

268
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,093
- Sealed bottle!
- Thank you. Alright!

269
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,178
- I'm not really old enough to drink.
- Yeah, it's illegal.

270
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:39,638
Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

271
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:43,765
Nobody's reporting anybody.
It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

272
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:45,224
Careful!

273
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:49,100
What is this? Instant marshmallows?
Nice touch!

274
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,103
- That was Alan's idea.
- Good thinking, Al!

275
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,688
You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu!
This place is paradise.

276
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:58,938
Not bad, right?

277
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:03,481
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm actually jealous of you.

278
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:06,983
- I mean, Lauren is an angel.
- Yeah, she really is amazing.

279
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,567
Wow, you guys are sweet.

280
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:13,278
Not big breasts on her. But still, solid
rack for an Asian.

281
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:16,530
- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true.
- That's ok.

282
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,656
That is just wildly inappropriate.

283
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:23,367
And yet... I'm really glad you're here.
All you guys. Even you Alan.

284
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:28,827
It means a lot that you made the trip.
Thank you.

285
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:31,412
- Wouldn't have missed it buddy.
- Great!

286
00:22:31,412 --> 00:22:36,039
Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

287
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:39,874
Alright. Toast! C'mon stand up guys.

288
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:42,917
Come over here, Alan!

289
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:45,460
To Lauren and Stu!

290
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,086
- You did it, buddy.
- Sure did.

291
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:53,755
Cheers!

292
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:08,706
What the hell...

293
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:48,307
What?

294
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,860
Phil...

295
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,611
I think it happened again.

296
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:19,238
- Alan, what the fuck did you do?
- I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

297
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:22,907
Your hair is gone.

298
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:27,742
No, no... up.

299
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:37,705
Where the fuck are we?

300
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:47,793
Phil, I'm scared.

301
00:25:55,838 --> 00:26:00,507
Stu, c'mon get up! We got a situation.

302
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:11,720
- Oh, holy shit!
- Where are we?

303
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:17,807
- Oh my god, Alan. Your head.
- No your head!

304
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,642
- Is it bald?
- Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

305
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:26,311
- Why? Was it my teeth?
- Nope, it's not your teeth.

306
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,937
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

307
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:32,271
Can you see the bottom?

308
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:36,982
Oh my god! What the fu...ck

309
00:26:38,524 --> 00:26:41,568
That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

310
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:46,153
It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

311
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:50,238
- Alan, what did you do! Did you Roofie me?
- I didn't do anything!

312
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:53,948
Stu, he swore to god!

313
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,492
What happened?

314
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:03,202
Get it off of me!

315
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,830
- What the hell?
- It's a monkey.

316
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,331
What a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.

317
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:15,083
Alan...

318
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:19,501
Phone! Alan, go find the phone!

319
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,961
I got it!

320
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,088
- Doug, where the hell are you?
- I'm at breakfast. By the pool.

321
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:29,214
- You guys coming down or what?
- Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug's fine.

322
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:33,258
- Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort.
- Why aren't we at the resort.

323
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:34,801
What's going on? Where are you guys?

324
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:38,594
I do not know, man! We woke up
in some shit hole room in some city.

325
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:42,137
- Oh god. What city?
- I don't know, Doug!

326
00:27:42,137 --> 00:27:44,888
Fuckin Asia-town.

327
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:49,516
- I do not know, I told you.
- Where are we?

328
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:55,518
- Hey Stu.
- What?

329
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:58,103
Check this out.

330
00:27:58,103 --> 00:28:02,605
Ever seen anything like this?

331
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:11,651
- What is that?
- Careful. Might be a spiders nest.

332
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:14,111
I've tangled with those before.

333
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:18,738
I don't get it man. We each had one beer
last night, right? I mean you too!

334
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:22,573
- Yeah but I left early, remember?
- I don't remember shit!

335
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:25,448
Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came
down to get me.

336
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:29,451
- Wait and second. Is Teddy with you guys?
- Teddy? What? What are you talking about?

337
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:32,243
He wasn't in his room. They've been
looking for him all morning.

338
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,120
- Teddy went to Stanford, right?
- Yeah. Why?

339
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,496
Fuck!

340
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:42,123
- I just found his finger!
- What?

341
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:46,876
- I just found his fucking finger, Doug!
- Phil, what is going on?

342
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:51,043
Alright. Alright, alright... this is
what we're gonna do.

343
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:54,170
You tell the girls that we woke up early and went
on a fishing trip, ok. And that's where we are.

344
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,297
- Right.
- Right, stay by the phone!

345
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:02,882
Shit!

346
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:06,634
Uh, we got a little bit of a problem.

347
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:09,052
What is that?

348
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:11,636
We don't know.

349
00:29:11,636 --> 00:29:16,222
- Is it a worm?
- It's a mushroom.

350
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:19,890
Yeah, shiitake.

351
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,892
Monkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?

352
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:27,394
- He can't understand you.
- He just did.

353
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:30,686
- Why is he pulling on it?
- He's probably hungry.

354
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,063
Wait a second. Is that...

355
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:37,690
What the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey
to leave my shit alone.

356
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,232
Chow?

357
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:42,109
You're fucking crazy.

358
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:46,777
It's so fucking light in here!
Alan, grab me my sunglasses!

359
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:52,530
- It's great to see you, Leslie!
- Nice to see you too my little popo.

360
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:54,573
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

361
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:58,116
Alan called me a few days ago and
invited me to the wedding.

362
00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,325
- Excuse me?
- What, he's my plus one.

363
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:02,869
You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

364
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:06,036
Guys, guys. Just focus, ok.
Chow, what happened?

365
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:10,663
You guys texted me, said you're fucked
up and looking to party.

366
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:19,501
I picked you up on my boat and I brought
you here to Bangkok.

367
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:22,126
But we had a sick night, bitches!

368
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:26,837
Wait a second Chow,  we're in Bangkok?

369
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:30,256
Holler, city of squalor.

370
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:34,883
- Do you know how I got this tattoo?
- Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

371
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:37,925
Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

372
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:42,386
What's the monkey holding?

373
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:46,387
- That's a finger!
- Stu, I got some bad news.

374
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:51,056
Teddy was with us last night.
That's his finger.

375
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:56,726
- Teddy's dead?
- Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

376
00:30:57,226 --> 00:31:00,936
- Well then where is he?
- Don't you remember anything?

377
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:04,188
- No!
- No, nothing, Chow.

378
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:07,231
Ok I explain it all, ok?

379
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:11,900
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight.
Come to papa.

380
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:16,735
That's a big...

381
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:24,239
You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

382
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:36,161
Chow!

383
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:40,663
Hey Chow, you okay?

384
00:31:40,663 --> 00:31:45,332
You gotta be kidding me.

385
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:53,127
Fuck, he's dead!

386
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:58,379
- Help!
- Stu!

387
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:01,547
- Help!
- Stu, shut up!

388
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,381
- Call an ambulance!
- Shut up! He's dead!

389
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,176
Look if someone comes and finds a dead
body and a pile of cocaine...

390
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:11,219
We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking
lives in a Thai prison.

391
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:15,137
Alan! Please don't cry!

392
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:19,723
Alright. Alright. I just need a second to
figure this out.

393
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,648
ICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.

394
00:32:52,112 --> 00:32:54,197
Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

395
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:55,947
What the fuck is this place?

396
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:59,575
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its
population is 12 million people...

397
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:04,327
Alan, will you help!

398
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:12,538
- The elevator!
- I'll get the button!

399
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:18,540
- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey?
- That monkey gets it!

400
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,500
- Come on!
- Fuck no!

401
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,460
The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

402
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,128
- Oh fuck!
- Come on!

403
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,298
Here it is!

404
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:36,967
Feet first. I've done this before.

405
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,471
Careful!

406
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:05,980
- Stu!
- What?

407
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,607
- We still have to find Teddy!
- Oh god.

408
00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:19,111
The roof!

409
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:23,738
Teddy!

410
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,868
- You guys see him?
- No!

411
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,456
He's not here.

412
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:50,125
I can't believe this is happening again.

413
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,044
Ok, look. We'll handle this. You get
back there.

414
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:58,545
You tell them that Alan and I got drunk
with him, we're still partying.

415
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:03,172
- You gotta go get married!
- No! Not going back without Teddy!

416
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:08,007
He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost,
he's injured.

417
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:12,635
If I fuck this up, I lose everything.

418
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:17,596
Ok.

419
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:20,472
Alright.

420
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:23,390
- Alan, check your pockets!
- What?

421
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,183
You know the drill. C'mon there might
be clues.

422
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:30,685
- Check your phones! Numbers, texts.
- That's a good idea!

423
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:33,812
- I got nothing. Fuck!
- I got an text from Chow.

424
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,604
- What time?
- Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

425
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:40,731
- What's it say?
- "On my way, Niggahs"

426
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:45,400
Oh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.

427
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:50,444
We are so... fucked!

428
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:55,030
Hey Phil! Look who's back!

429
00:35:56,823 --> 00:36:01,407
We gotta get you out of the sun. You're
too hot.

430
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:04,825
Phil, I really think we should go to
the American Consulate.

431
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:08,202
For what? To report a dead body we shoved
into an ice machine?

432
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:11,371
What are we gonna do? Keep walking around
in circles? Cause that's real productive.

433
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,872
You know I'm trying to figure this thing
out here and your attitude is not helping.

434
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,915
I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we
don't have a plan.

435
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:19,166
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

436
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,833
-What, it's a bag of Fanta!
- Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

437
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:22,917
I don't know!

438
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,836
Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

439
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:26,378
It is your fault!

440
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:28,754
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

441
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,838
Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

442
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,338
I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD.
They've got him. He's ok.

443
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:37,465
Oh thank god! Doug found him.

444
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:39,216
- What happened?
- He got arrested.

445
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:41,927
- Arrested? For what?
- Disorderly conduct.

446
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:44,135
- Seriously?
- Yeah! He's ok though.

447
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,846
They'll release him to you. No questions
asked. No one has to know.

448
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:52,514
He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

449
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:55,390
Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

450
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,892
Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We
gotta get a cab.

451
00:36:57,892 --> 00:37:02,560
- Ok!
- Alright!

452
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:06,771
- Yes, I have his paperwork here.
- Okay.

453
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:10,647
- He has been treated.
- Sounds good.

454
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:14,650
We're good. They've processed him for
release.

455
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,109
They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

456
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,861
Sixteen years old and spent a night in
jail. Can you imagine?

457
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:25,613
Haha! We love to party.

458
00:37:26,863 --> 00:37:29,490
Here we go!

459
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,240
- Wait who's this fuckin guy?
- Teddy Sisay.

460
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,284
No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

461
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:39,868
Excuse me.. I'm sorry. Officer. You brought
the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

462
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:43,788
Of course it is!
We have his ID's and everything!

463
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:46,706
These were in his pocket
when we made the arrest.

464
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:49,582
They were in his pocket?

465
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:54,125
Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

466
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,834
Hello?

467
00:37:55,834 --> 00:38:00,462
Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English,
Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

468
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:02,879
Let me ask you something.

469
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:07,548
Does he look like he works out at Bally
Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

470
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:12,342
Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot
analyze everything.

471
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:18,553
- What do you expect us to do with this guy?
- Not my problem!

472
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:23,348
Hey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.

473
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,601
You know where our friend is, Teddy?
He's missing!

474
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,187
- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless.
- He knows something!

475
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,979
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

476
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:42,773
Maybe he just doesn't understand. I'll
act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

477
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,358
- Two words.
- Is it a movie?

478
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,109
This is not for you, Alan!

479
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:54,737
- American teenager... in Asia.
- Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

480
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:59,113
It's easy cause you're talking to him.

481
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:02,698
Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave
this fucking guy here.

482
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:06,534
Here's something. There are 500 thousand
monks living in Thailand.

483
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:11,285
It is not uncommon for some monks to take
a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

484
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,996
There you go.

485
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:18,289
- Anything else in that envelope?
- Nah, it's empty.

486
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:23,041
Woah, hang on. A drink card from White
Lion bar in Bangkok?

487
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:27,835
Worth a shot.

488
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:30,837
Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

489
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:35,505
That's what it says.

490
00:39:38,715 --> 00:39:43,384
- Whoa! This is the White Lion!
- What the fuck happened here?

491
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:46,135
Holy shit!

492
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:50,262
(yelling in Thai)

493
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,888
- Let's...
- We should probably...

494
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,016
That's ok.

495
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:03,517
What the fuck is going on here?

496
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:08,145
- Whoa, guys. Check it out!
- Holy shit! Stu, look!

497
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:13,356
That's my face. Go, go go!
Nice work, Alan!

498
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:20,776
- Hello?
- Be with you in a minute!

499
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,946
- Excuse me.
- Oh, look who it is!

500
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:29,614
- So what do ya think?
- What, I'm sorry?

501
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:34,283
- The tattoo. You love it?
- Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

502
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:37,617
- No refunds. Get the fuck out!
- Wait a second!

503
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:39,285
Read the sign!

504
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:40,786
NO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

505
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,328
We don't want any refunds. We just have
a couple of questions.

506
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:45,371
We're trying to figure out what went
down last night.

507
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:50,040
What went down? Take a look at what you
did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.

508
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,792
- We did that?
- You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

509
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:58,460
- Starting a full on fuckin riot?
- Sir, we don't remember anything.

510
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:06,964
Oh boy...

511
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,632
Check this out!

512
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:17,552
Oh shit!

513
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:22,554
Fuck the Police!

514
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:29,349
There's Teddy! He was with us!

515
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,730
Jesus christ!

516
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,439
That's when the cops arrived and started
cracking skulls.

517
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:47,274
I took you guys and hid you in the
shop here.

518
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:51,568
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
You cried like a little bitch.

519
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:54,736
This kid is fucking nine years old. He's
got balls twice your size.

520
00:41:54,736 --> 00:41:58,446
- Show him your balls, Nao!
- No, no, no. That's ok.

521
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:02,072
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy.
Have you seen him?

522
00:42:02,072 --> 00:42:04,241
Not since last night. Why? What happened?

523
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:08,910
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister
tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

524
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:13,119
- Oh well. Then fuck it!
- What do you mean, fuck it?

525
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,705
Bangkok has him now and she'll never
let him go.

526
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:20,748
- You hear that, huh? Is this what you
wanted? You happy now?

527
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:24,166
You're wasting your time. These monks
take their vow shit seriously.

528
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:28,835
Look at this. That's the sign of the Chang
Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

529
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,921
Maybe somebody over there can get him
to talk.

530
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:39,590
- Ok, can we just go over this one
more time? You got the beer from...

531
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,508
- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case.
- Right.

532
00:42:43,508 --> 00:42:46,885
- But, who gave it to you?
- The bartender.

533
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:49,261
And then you brought em out and
I  opened them.

534
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:52,595
Yeah and Doug had one and he was fine
so it's not the beer.

535
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:55,013
- So what the hell happened?
- I have no idea!

536
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:58,431
Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a
Chinese boner.

537
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:03,058
Alan, come on! Cut it out!

538
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:08,477
- That is so wrong!
- Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

539
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:22,360
When a monkey nibbles on a penis
it's funny in any language!

540
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:27,653
Keep doing it!

541
00:43:27,653 --> 00:43:30,864
Alright, thank you!

542
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:35,533
Bye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!

543
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:48,454
Wow! So beautiful!

544
00:43:48,664 --> 00:43:52,332
What is this, a PF Chang's?

545
00:43:52,332 --> 00:43:55,167
Ah, they're meditating.

546
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:58,417
- Such a peaceful people!
- Yeah.

547
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:02,294
- Knock, knock! Hello!
- Alan! Show some respect!

548
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:06,296
- Don't get up guys.
- We brought one of your guys back.

549
00:44:06,296 --> 00:44:09,089
He's really funny. He's really nice
and cool.

550
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:13,716
Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

551
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:19,303
- Excuse me... ow... Wait!
- Stop it! Calm down!

552
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:23,930
Hold on. It's because we're talking.

553
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,514
God damn it! Oh! Stop!

554
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:29,474
Wait it's me!

555
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:34,101
Oh I get it.

556
00:44:34,475 --> 00:44:39,228
No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

557
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,148
Ok.

558
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,950
Late last night, you climbed the walls
of our monastery.

559
00:45:09,034 --> 00:45:13,702
Shouting out questions about love, marriage
and the meaning of life.

560
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:19,872
Poor brother Han was meditating alone
in the garden.

561
00:45:19,872 --> 00:45:24,373
- And you took him.
- Oh my god!

562
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:28,668
- We kidnapped a monk.
- We live an alternative life style.

563
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:33,337
We are so sorry about that, but we weren't
ourselves last night.

564
00:45:33,836 --> 00:45:38,547
Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little
bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

565
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:43,007
Can you find out if he knows where our
friend is?

566
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:46,425
Brother Han took a vow of silence many
years ago.

567
00:45:46,425 --> 00:45:48,551
It would be useless to try.

568
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:52,594
Well maybe he can write down what happened,
on a piece of paper?

569
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:55,721
Actually Phil, that would be cheating.
Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

570
00:45:55,721 --> 00:45:58,638
- Alan!
- I'm afraid fatty is right.

571
00:45:58,638 --> 00:46:00,599
See?... What?

572
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,226
None of us will ever know what brother
Han knows.

573
00:46:05,351 --> 00:46:08,603
Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people.
Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

574
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:12,604
Hey you know what! FYI! You may want to
put some signs up that say no talking...

575
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,896
- ...before you unleash your dragon.
- Yeah, that was a little rough.

576
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:17,940
And "your welcome" for bringing him
back safe.

577
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,775
- You know we found him in the drunk tank.
- Yeah well we did take him in the first place.

578
00:46:20,775 --> 00:46:25,443
- C'mon guys, let's go.
- Wait!

579
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:30,153
The Buddha teach, every memory lives
somewhere deep within.

580
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:35,740
Perhaps you should bring your question
to the Garden of Meditation.

581
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:38,950
- Did you understand a word he just said?
- Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

582
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,576
He said something about the Garden of
Meditation?

583
00:46:40,576 --> 00:46:43,201
No, he said he's farting because of
his medication.

584
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:47,870
I get that.

585
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:54,998
It's a waste of time. I don't remember
anything. Do you?

586
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:59,918
No. I got nothing. Alan?

587
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:06,963
Alan!

588
00:47:06,963 --> 00:47:10,172
"Every memory lives somewhere deep within"

589
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:11,923
- Sweetie.
- What?

590
00:47:11,923 --> 00:47:13,423
You have visitors.

591
00:47:13,423 --> 00:47:15,174
- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys!

592
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:17,217
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey buddy!

593
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:19,135
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

594
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:23,761
- Is this true, Stuart?
- Yeah, why not. It'll be fun.

595
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:25,096
Fuck!

596
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:29,764
- For Lauren and Stu!
- Cheers!

597
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:35,600
- Chow!
- We had a sick night bitches!

598
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,101
Alan, what the fuck!

599
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:40,060
Is that person coming to the wedding?

600
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,563
- There is no wolfpack.
- Alan, Alan, don't do that!

601
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:45,230
And finally...

602
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,899
The three best friends anyone could have.

603
00:47:56,944 --> 00:48:01,528
Fuck the Police!

604
00:48:10,825 --> 00:48:15,243
I know where to go.

605
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:19,120
- What do you think, Alan?
- This is the place.

606
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,831
C'mon. Let's go.

607
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:28,500
I don't remember any of this!

608
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,167
- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

609
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:42,173
Rose! Harmony!

610
00:48:42,173 --> 00:48:44,465
Is he coming or what? I've been waiting
all day for him.

611
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:49,051
- I'm sorry. Waiting for who?
- Chow, that dick ass fuck!

612
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:52,427
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothings wrong.

613
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:57,054
Ok, good. Look at this. Look what I
bring for him. Check it out, huh.

614
00:48:57,096 --> 00:48:59,431
- No, no!
- $ 6,000 American.

615
00:48:59,431 --> 00:49:04,099
Wow looks so real!

616
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:09,435
Sorry!

617
00:49:09,435 --> 00:49:13,979
- Alan, what the fuck!
- It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

618
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:17,563
Everybody ok?

619
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:22,274
Ok, then get the fuck back to work!
Come on. Music, please!

620
00:49:23,316 --> 00:49:24,900
Where is my 6,000 dollars?

621
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,527
6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal. We
got nothing to do with that.

622
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:30,528
Un-fucking believable.

623
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:34,071
This guy, if he backs out again, the
shits gonna catch up with him.

624
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,740
He's made a lot of enemies in this town,
and now they're gonna be your enemies.

625
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,282
That's not fair!

626
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:41,658
Ok listen. We're just looking for a
little kid.

627
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:43,575
- 2,000 dollars.
- What!

628
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:46,328
I don't know, maybe more. How young you
want this kid to be?

629
00:49:46,328 --> 00:49:50,995
No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We're
looking for our friend... 16 years old.

630
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:54,873
- Teddy.
- Teddy?

631
00:49:54,873 --> 00:49:57,081
- Yeah he was here with you guys last night.
- He was?

632
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:58,791
Do you know if he left with us?

633
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:01,333
I don't know. You were in the corner all
night with Kimmy.

634
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,126
- I didn't see you leave.
- Kimmy?

635
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:06,294
- Is she here?
- Yes, she's in the back. She just came for her shit.

636
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,003
Go and talk to her.

637
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:10,463
Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything
that happened.

638
00:50:10,463 --> 00:50:12,797
Listen to me, ok? Pay attention to what
I'm going to talk to you know.

639
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:16,716
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir
says "Hello".

640
00:50:16,716 --> 00:50:17,549
Okay!

641
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:22,259
But do it like that, ok! "Hello" like
threatening. Like, ironic.

642
00:50:23,302 --> 00:50:27,929
- "Hellooo"
- Okay!

643
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:33,973
Go away! Go away!

644
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:35,058
??

645
00:50:35,058 --> 00:50:38,684
Of course I remember him. He was buying
shots for everyone.

646
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:42,228
Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

647
00:50:42,228 --> 00:50:43,770
You have no idea.

648
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,229
Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

649
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:49,981
Yeah, you were all leaving together, but
you almost forgot this one right here.

650
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:53,023
Right, super star?

651
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:57,318
This one was following me around like a
little puppy dog. All night.

652
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:01,987
Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked
me to marry him.

653
00:51:02,403 --> 00:51:05,071
Classic Stu!

654
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:07,739
- We didn't get married, did we?
- Course not!

655
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:10,241
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

656
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:13,700
- What happens in the Chardonnay room?
- Let's just stay on task.

657
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,451
I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

658
00:51:19,036 --> 00:51:21,537
- Fuck!
- It's ok. You're not married yet.

659
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,371
- No big deal.
- It's cheating!

660
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,206
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

661
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:28,416
It's a violation of my moral code.

662
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:33,000
Don't be sad. Stu you loved it. You were
crying, saying how special it was.

663
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:37,336
- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying?
- What a baby. He was crying.

664
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:42,005
You should have seen him. He was so
sexy. The way he moved around.

665
00:51:42,005 --> 00:51:46,632
I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't
drop my load too quick.

666
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:51,593
- Load? What load?
- Oh, you know... My sperms.

667
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,637
I think your English is off. You're talking
about my sperm!

668
00:51:57,637 --> 00:52:00,679
- Where would your sperm come from?
- From my balls!

669
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:05,348
- Hold on! Back up!
- Wait... Are you...

670
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:07,224
Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

671
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:11,893
- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt".
- Oh!

672
00:52:14,728 --> 00:52:19,439
- Oh god!
- Wow.

673
00:52:20,272 --> 00:52:23,357
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

674
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:28,068
Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed
at the same time.

675
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:29,985
How's that work?

676
00:52:29,985 --> 00:52:33,279
Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load
on the floor.

677
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:37,989
- Ok!
- You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

678
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,991
Oh god!

679
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:51,745
- Stu! It's not the end of the world.
- Sorry, but I'm so confused.

680
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:56,205
I made love to a man... with boobies.

681
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:59,791
Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna
find out about this.

682
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,499
But we found out about it.

683
00:53:01,499 --> 00:53:03,751
And then we forget. That's what we do!

684
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:07,044
I do so much fucked up shit. And I just
forget about it.

685
00:53:07,044 --> 00:53:10,588
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

686
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:13,672
That might be harder to go away, but in
time it'll happen.

687
00:53:13,672 --> 00:53:18,424
I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

688
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:21,551
- Never happened.
- Great!

689
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:24,135
Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

690
00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:27,011
Lauren's dad. He just reminded me...

691
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:28,721
- Answer it!
- I can't.

692
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:31,388
What! He might know something about Teddy.
C'mon we still have a shot here.

693
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:36,099
Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

694
00:53:39,392 --> 00:53:40,558
Hello?

695
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:43,852
Who takes an all day fishing trip the
day before a wedding?

696
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:48,479
- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid.
- Put Teddy on the phone.

697
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:53,731
- Teddy's seasick actually.
- Seasick?

698
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:58,442
- Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine.
- That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

699
00:53:58,984 --> 00:54:02,194
I'm gonna tell you something that you do
not know.

700
00:54:02,236 --> 00:54:05,363
- I don't like you.
- Yeah,I knew that already.

701
00:54:05,363 --> 00:54:07,196
If my daughter chooses you,
that's her problem.

702
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:08,947
This is ??.
Hey it's Phil Winnick!

703
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:13,490
Listen, I apologize. We've been reelin
in some crazy Marlin and I just wanna say...

704
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,242
Phil!

705
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:16,992
- Jesus!
- Phil!

706
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:18,368
Fuck me!

707
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,495
- Give us back our monkey!
- What monkey? Get your own monkey!

708
00:54:21,495 --> 00:54:24,579
Come on, you asshole, the fucking monkey!

709
00:54:24,579 --> 00:54:26,038
Come on!

710
00:54:26,038 --> 00:54:28,288
Anytime, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us!

711
00:54:28,288 --> 00:54:29,456
This is our monkey!

712
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:31,624
No one's getting shot over a fucking monkey!

713
00:54:31,624 --> 00:54:33,750
Hand him over, now!

714
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,543
God, I've never given him no monkeys.

715
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:40,753
No, no ...

716
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:44,505
Hey Phil, check it out. He's got a banana
on his helmet. He's the real deal.

717
00:54:44,505 --> 00:54:45,714
What the fuck's happening?

718
00:54:45,714 --> 00:54:48,673
Hold on! How did this happen? Do you
know where our friend is?

719
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:53,342
- Yeah. Sixteen years old. Asian kid.
- (says something in Russian?)

720
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:55,802
No, I don't understand what you said! No, I
didn't understand!

721
00:54:55,802 --> 00:54:58,136
What'd he say?

722
00:54:58,136 --> 00:55:02,638
He said fuck you and your questions!

723
00:55:02,638 --> 00:55:06,473
- Oh, my arm!
- Philip, are you okay?

724
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:10,308
Oh I got shot! Fuck! Fuck this!

725
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:12,185
It's alright, Phil! It's alright!

726
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:14,561
We'll figure this out and get the monkey
back, I promise.

727
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,604
Who gives a fuck about the monkey!

728
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:23,232
- What the fuck is going on?
- Stu, am I gonna be ok? You're a doctor.

729
00:55:24,357 --> 00:55:28,109
I don't know, let me look!

730
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:30,317
What?

731
00:55:30,317 --> 00:55:31,819
Don't look at it!

732
00:55:31,819 --> 00:55:35,070
Stuart Price! Get your ass back over here!

733
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:39,739
- You got shot!
- I know!

734
00:55:51,994 --> 00:55:56,329
- Whoa, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

735
00:55:56,329 --> 00:56:00,706
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm.
Eight stitches.

736
00:56:00,706 --> 00:56:03,541
Only cost six dollars. How is that even
possible?

737
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:08,210
How's any of this even possible?

738
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:13,545
If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

739
00:56:14,463 --> 00:56:19,090
What are we gonna do?

740
00:56:21,257 --> 00:56:25,426
I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

741
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:30,137
- What plan, Alan?
- I've said too much already.

742
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:42,185
Alan! What plan?

743
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:45,476
- It's all Teddy's fault.
- What are you talking about, Alan?

744
00:56:45,476 --> 00:56:47,811
Why is he even here? He's not part of
the wolf pack!

745
00:56:47,811 --> 00:56:51,396
- Alan, what did you do?
- It's not my fault!

746
00:56:51,396 --> 00:56:55,315
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

747
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:57,774
- What bag?
- The marshmallows.

748
00:56:57,774 --> 00:56:59,567
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

749
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:01,234
But it was dark and it was hard to keep
track.

750
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:04,527
And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't
tell which was which.

751
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:07,905
- It was mayhem!
- What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

752
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:10,572
Alan, what did you do?

753
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:12,406
Isn't it obvious?

754
00:57:12,406 --> 00:57:16,658
I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And
plus my ADHD medication.

755
00:57:16,658 --> 00:57:18,659
- What?
- You drugged us again?!

756
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:22,494
Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a
little while so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

757
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:26,912
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that
you didn't do anything!

758
00:57:26,912 --> 00:57:28,664
Alan, you swore to god!

759
00:57:28,664 --> 00:57:30,623
I just wanted things to stay the same.

760
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,250
Like at my face! You ruined my life!

761
00:57:35,374 --> 00:57:36,709
You're not my friend!

762
00:57:36,709 --> 00:57:39,335
Don't say that, Phil! You're serious?
Even in America?

763
00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:43,253
- Yes!
- Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

764
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:46,172
- Don't start crying, Alan!
- You're the bearded devil!

765
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:49,132
You liked it! You smiled at me when I
handed you the bag with marshmallows.

766
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:53,926
Because I like marshmallows, you
fucking psycho!

767
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:56,676
Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

768
00:57:56,676 --> 00:57:58,302
Enough!

769
00:57:58,302 --> 00:58:01,345
- Why, Alan? Why?
- Stu!

770
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:03,888
Because we're the three best
friends, remember?

771
00:58:03,888 --> 00:58:05,597
Remember?

772
00:58:05,597 --> 00:58:10,099
Stu, that's enough...

773
00:58:11,683 --> 00:58:16,394
Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta
stick together.

774
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:23,980
- Alan, what's that written on your belly?
- What? Huh?

775
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,149
Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

776
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:30,858
- You write that?
- No!

777
00:58:30,858 --> 00:58:33,485
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

778
00:58:33,485 --> 00:58:35,361
What about England, Phil? Will we still
be friends there?

779
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:40,029
Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the
moment. We're still friends. All over the world.

780
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,906
- Even Great Britain?
- Yeah.

781
00:58:45,115 --> 00:58:47,908
What about you, Stu?

782
00:58:47,908 --> 00:58:50,826
We'll see.

783
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:55,495
Gentlemen, follow me.

784
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:11,585
Here you go.

785
00:59:12,502 --> 00:59:15,087
Well. About time! Sit down.

786
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:17,797
Come on, sit.

787
00:59:17,797 --> 00:59:22,340
Wow, you guys look like shit.

788
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,798
- Uh, do we know you?
- Hey!

789
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:28,427
Take off your fuckin hat. You're in a
restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

790
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:35,222
Ok, listen. We have no clue what's
going on here.

791
00:59:35,222 --> 00:59:39,265
You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here,
it's fuckin unreal.

792
00:59:39,265 --> 00:59:43,892
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up! Oh, I'm
sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

793
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:52,646
- Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you...
- You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

794
00:59:53,314 --> 00:59:57,856
Where's Chow? With the fuckin account
code and the fuckin password!

795
01:00:04,943 --> 01:00:09,570
We don't know anything about any codes. We're
just trying to find our friend.

796
01:00:12,864 --> 01:00:17,491
- Teddy?
- Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

797
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,744
Hmm, let's see...

798
01:00:23,744 --> 01:00:26,079
There's Teddy!

799
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,621
Holy shit! It's from last night.

800
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:33,873
- Who are you?
- I'm a businessman.

801
01:00:33,873 --> 01:00:38,167
And I've invested a large chunk of capital
in your friend Chow.

802
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:42,002
And in return, he was supposed to transfer
my profits electronically.

803
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:45,962
About five fuckin minutes ago.

804
01:00:45,962 --> 01:00:50,340
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

805
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:55,008
- Oh my god! Is he okay?
- Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

806
01:00:56,342 --> 01:00:59,677
You tell Chow, that we are having breakfast
on the roof of this hotel...

807
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:03,136
...tomorrow morning at eight am.

808
01:01:03,136 --> 01:01:05,180
Or if he makes the transfer, you will
get Teddy.

809
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:09,890
If not well then hey, you know...
it's Bangkok.

810
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:16,018
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

811
01:01:19,811 --> 01:01:23,312
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

812
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:26,647
Alan leave the hat.

813
01:01:26,647 --> 01:01:31,316
Atta boy.

814
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:40,487
We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

815
01:01:40,487 --> 01:01:45,197
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow, Stu.
This whole things about a fucking bank account.

816
01:01:46,157 --> 01:01:48,783
Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll
search Chow's body.

817
01:01:48,783 --> 01:01:52,034
Hopefully the password's in his
wallet or something.

818
01:01:52,034 --> 01:01:54,369
- And what if it isn't?
- He's gonna kill Teddy.

819
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:59,078
Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow
to figure it out.

820
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:05,874
First the monkey and now my hat. How
much worse can this day get.

821
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:14,586
Jesus christ!

822
01:02:18,754 --> 01:02:23,423
Well we're livin here in Alan town. And
he's drivin our lives into the ground.

823
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,803
When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.

824
01:02:33,803 --> 01:02:38,472
Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.

825
01:02:41,473 --> 01:02:46,142
I was happy, and my life was good.

826
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:50,936
Getting married like a dentist should.

827
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:54,646
Roasting marshmallows on a stick.

828
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:59,315
I got fucked in the ass... by a girl
with a dick.

829
01:03:01,899 --> 01:03:06,026
Oh yeah, remember that.

830
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:10,737
And we're livin in Alan town.

831
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,655
There's water everywhere.

832
01:03:14,655 --> 01:03:17,532
Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The
fuckin powers out.

833
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:20,366
With an inadequate electrical grid,
serving millions of people

834
01:03:20,366 --> 01:03:23,659
Bangkok experiences 1500 power
outages per year.

835
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:25,701
Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

836
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:30,329
Out of the way!

837
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:37,916
We got it.

838
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:43,001
Oh my god!

839
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:45,836
Chow, calm down!

840
01:03:45,878 --> 01:03:50,505
- You put the chill on me?
- No, no!

841
01:03:51,338 --> 01:03:53,339
It's okay.

842
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:57,925
Relax!

843
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:07,263
It's just us. Breathe!

844
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:08,472
It was so cold.

845
01:04:08,472 --> 01:04:11,764
- We're gonna warm you up.
- I was so cold!

846
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:16,433
- You did good, buddy. You did good.
- I did good.

847
01:04:20,727 --> 01:04:23,104
Feelin better?

848
01:04:23,145 --> 01:04:25,854
- Alright, you warm enough?
- I don't know.

849
01:04:25,854 --> 01:04:27,730
Come feel my bowels and tell me.

850
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:31,024
I've been locked in a fuckin ice box
all day!

851
01:04:31,024 --> 01:04:33,649
Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

852
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:36,692
...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

853
01:04:36,692 --> 01:04:40,694
Chow, nobody killed you. You were already
dead. You didn't have a pulse.

854
01:04:40,694 --> 01:04:42,612
Oh, you never do blow before?

855
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:45,197
Sometimes your heart stop... start
up again.

856
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:48,405
- Read a book!
- Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

857
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:52,492
Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

858
01:04:52,492 --> 01:04:55,368
- I got shot!
- But did you die?

859
01:04:55,368 --> 01:04:58,703
Chow, some guy told us that you got
a bank code or something...

860
01:04:58,703 --> 01:05:02,038
...and if we don't bring it to him first
think in the morning...

861
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:03,455
...he's gonna kill Teddy.

862
01:05:03,455 --> 01:05:08,082
Who, Kingsley? He harmless. Don't worry.
I got the bank codes.

863
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:15,168
Great! Alright, we gotta meet him at 8am.
Who is that fuckin guy, anyway?

864
01:05:15,503 --> 01:05:18,919
- An investor in my business.
- Yeah, what business is that?

865
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:22,088
It's called "not your business" ok!

866
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:25,340
- Oh, where's the monkey?
- The monkey...

867
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:30,051
Yeah I put the account number and
password in his vest. Where is he?

868
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:35,386
- Why would you do that?
- Safe keeping, pretty boy.

869
01:05:35,386 --> 01:05:40,055
I got a lotta heat on my ass. I got
FBI, Bangkok PD, Interpol, MSNBC...

870
01:05:43,056 --> 01:05:45,016
That little monkey snorting coke with me
all night...

871
01:05:45,016 --> 01:05:48,143
Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make
fuckin lady boy.

872
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:52,061
- He not going anywhere.
- We don't have the monkey, Chow.

873
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:54,895
Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

874
01:05:54,895 --> 01:05:57,688
Oh you fucking guys!

875
01:05:57,688 --> 01:06:01,439
Okay. No problem. We just have to get
him back.

876
01:06:01,439 --> 01:06:06,150
- From where?
- From the same place we took him from.

877
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:30,036
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

878
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,042
Every night, monkey drug mule.

879
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:48,711
He take coke to buyer...

880
01:06:49,212 --> 01:06:53,505
And deliver cash to dealer. He
middle man.

881
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:56,299
Dealer never handle drug directly.

882
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:59,507
He clean.

883
01:06:59,507 --> 01:07:04,052
- That's terrible.
- Not terrible. What he talking about. Fucking genius.

884
01:07:04,052 --> 01:07:07,720
You ever see monkey go to jail?

885
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,473
We just take the monkey for deal, he come
close, we take his vest. That's that.

886
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:17,350
- We get some blow too, you know... bump.
- No, no more bumps, Chow.

887
01:07:18,976 --> 01:07:23,144
This is ridiculous.

888
01:07:23,144 --> 01:07:27,770
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Shake your
monkey.

889
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:38,484
Alright, here we go.

890
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:43,153
Come on!

891
01:07:44,778 --> 01:07:46,988
How did we wind up with the monkey
last night anyway?

892
01:07:46,988 --> 01:07:49,239
I needed some blow and Alan thought
he was cute...

893
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:53,950
...so we stole him!

894
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,662
So stupid!

895
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,288
Stu, ready to grab vest?

896
01:08:05,288 --> 01:08:09,832
- Okay. I just grab it?
- Yeah, just do it. Just do it.

897
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:14,500
- Hey, little monkey.
- Alan, be quiet.

898
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:19,253
- Fuck!
- We gotta go, right now!

899
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:23,922
- Pull that fuckin monkey in!
- I'm trying!

900
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,467
Shit!

901
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:35,551
- Get that monkey in here, Stu!
- He won't let go!

902
01:08:35,551 --> 01:08:38,220
Stu, get back in the car! Right now!

903
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:42,889
I'm trying! Slow down!

904
01:08:46,391 --> 01:08:50,976
He's so strong!

905
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:54,186
Let go you fuckin monkey!

906
01:08:54,186 --> 01:08:58,854
- Look out!
- Oh shit! Tight squeeze!

907
01:08:59,854 --> 01:09:04,398
I got him!

908
01:09:04,398 --> 01:09:09,192
- Where's the code, Chow?
- Check his little vest.

909
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:13,361
- Got it, Alan?
- Yes, I got a .

910
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:18,071
- Slow down Chow!
- Hold on, J-Birds.

911
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:23,073
Holy Shit!

912
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:27,117
Don't worry. I got this shit!

913
01:09:27,117 --> 01:09:31,744
Pig!

914
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:34,162
Oh, my word.

915
01:09:34,162 --> 01:09:38,789
Sorry, Stu! My bad!

916
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:43,499
Oh, shit!

917
01:09:43,499 --> 01:09:44,917
Get down!

918
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:47,418
What the fuck!

919
01:09:47,418 --> 01:09:50,295
Oh no! He shot the monkey!

920
01:09:50,295 --> 01:09:52,921
They shot the monkey.

921
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:57,548
I'm at my wits end.

922
01:09:57,548 --> 01:09:59,798
He's coming back around.

923
01:09:59,798 --> 01:10:04,509
Look out!

924
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:09,344
- Holy fuck!
- Oh no...

925
01:10:25,978 --> 01:10:29,105
- Everyone alright?
- Yeah.

926
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:33,731
I have such an erection right now!

927
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:40,484
Are you for real?

928
01:10:51,406 --> 01:10:56,033
They're gonna take good care of you
here, ok.

929
01:10:56,075 --> 01:10:59,910
What's that?

930
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:04,537
Oh, yeah. Cigarettes. Got em right here.
Here you go.

931
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:12,833
Right here.

932
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:17,084
Deep breathe. Good.

933
01:11:17,084 --> 01:11:19,627
Soak it in.

934
01:11:19,627 --> 01:11:24,005
Breathe the smoke into your tiny
little lungs. There you go.

935
01:11:24,005 --> 01:11:27,798
It's funny. I've never been much of a
smoker, but...

936
01:11:27,798 --> 01:11:30,049
Boy does it look cool on you.

937
01:11:30,049 --> 01:11:34,675
Alan, c'mon! Let's go!

938
01:11:35,593 --> 01:11:40,178
I'll miss you, monkey.

939
01:11:40,178 --> 01:11:44,013
I wish monkeys could Skype.

940
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:48,807
Maybe one day...

941
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:57,685
Come on! Get in!

942
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:32,327
Are you guys seriously this calm?

943
01:12:32,327 --> 01:12:34,829
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

944
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:36,996
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

945
01:12:36,996 --> 01:12:39,581
You ever do anything that doesn't end
up in a standoff, Chow?

946
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:42,707
I'm an international criminal. It always
ends like this.

947
01:12:42,707 --> 01:12:45,417
I met my wife at one of these things.

948
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:49,502
- You got a wife?
- Yeah, we married 15 years.

949
01:12:49,502 --> 01:12:53,086
What, I not good looking enough for woman?

950
01:12:53,086 --> 01:12:56,338
No, that's cool.

951
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:57,380
Let's do this!

952
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:01,715
- Welcome to the Tower Club.
- Blah blah blah, who cares.

953
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:06,426
Stop! Chow crossing.

954
01:13:07,427 --> 01:13:10,678
- Hey, Kingsley!
- Well, well.

955
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,637
Propecia looking nice!

956
01:13:12,637 --> 01:13:14,722
You been hitting the gym?

957
01:13:14,722 --> 01:13:18,098
Yes I am actually. Thank you for
noticing, Chow.

958
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:20,641
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

959
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:24,059
- Where's Teddy?
- He's waiting downstairs in my car.

960
01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:26,185
Send him up when the transfer is complete.

961
01:13:26,185 --> 01:13:28,977
Tell you what. Give me extra 50 grand, you
keep Teddy.

962
01:13:28,977 --> 01:13:33,688
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

963
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,607
- Chow.. Chow...
- Could we move this along!

964
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:41,150
Alan, account number. Come on, come on.

965
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:45,861
8-1-4, K as in knife, 2-3-9-8.

966
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:55,365
- Password?
- "baloney1"

967
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:56,866
Your password is "baloney1" ?

968
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:59,784
Well it used to be just "baloney" but
now they make you add number.

969
01:13:59,784 --> 01:14:04,495
Fuckin annoying.

970
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:15,333
- And it's that easy.
- Ta dah!

971
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:18,833
Oh look. You sunk my battleship.

972
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:23,462
- Great, now can we please have Teddy?
- Yeah. Bring him up.

973
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:30,006
See. We go to your wedding. We have fun. I
bust a nut.

974
01:14:30,006 --> 01:14:34,674
We did it, Stu. It's over!

975
01:14:41,178 --> 01:14:45,805
This is Bangkok police! Everybody down!

976
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,889
Oh, nuts!

977
01:14:47,889 --> 01:14:50,223
Kingsley, you're fucking Five-O?

978
01:14:50,223 --> 01:14:51,682
Gotcha, Leslie!

979
01:14:51,682 --> 01:14:52,766
Get him outta here.

980
01:14:52,766 --> 01:14:57,518
Go! Just do it! Go!

981
01:14:59,145 --> 01:15:01,145
How the fuck...

982
01:15:01,145 --> 01:15:05,980
Samir, you fucked me over six grand?
You camel jockey!

983
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:11,025
You spit on me?

984
01:15:11,025 --> 01:15:15,444
Six grand this time, eight grand last time.
It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

985
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:18,403
Principle? Nigga, please! We both dead inside.

986
01:15:18,403 --> 01:15:20,737
Call me nigga... don't call me "nigga"!

987
01:15:20,737 --> 01:15:24,907
- Put em in, motherfucker!
- He's an asshole, man.

988
01:15:24,907 --> 01:15:26,282
You guys ok?

989
01:15:26,282 --> 01:15:29,575
- What the fucks going on?
- Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

990
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:30,867
- You're a cop?
- Yes.

991
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:33,535
This sting operation has been in place
for weeks.

992
01:15:33,535 --> 01:15:36,161
When Samir told us that your friend
was lost...

993
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:40,746
We took advantage of that information.
I'm sorry.

994
01:15:41,998 --> 01:15:45,957
- So can Teddy come out of the car now?
- No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

995
01:15:45,957 --> 01:15:48,250
They don't have him. They never had him.

996
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:52,752
They just needed us to bring them Chow.
They used Teddy as bait.

997
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,462
- Do you have any leads at all?
- No. We've checked everywhere.

998
01:15:56,462 --> 01:15:59,380
No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

999
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:04,049
If you haven't found him by now, I'm afraid
Bangkok has him.

1000
01:16:08,635 --> 01:16:13,304
Why do people keep saying that?

1001
01:16:13,387 --> 01:16:18,014
Stu... It's time.

1002
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:24,351
Alan...

1003
01:16:24,351 --> 01:16:28,768
-I'm sorry.
- Don't say that. Please.

1004
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:32,896
- No this time we really fucked up.
- Oh god! How bad?

1005
01:16:32,896 --> 01:16:36,773
Like, no wedding bad?

1006
01:16:36,773 --> 01:16:41,442
Yeah... a little worse than that!

1007
01:17:03,993 --> 01:17:08,662
Ok, how about this? He fell off
the fishing boat and drowned.

1008
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,747
No.

1009
01:17:11,747 --> 01:17:15,582
Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

1010
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:18,666
- Alan!
- Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

1011
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,501
How many people get run over here?

1012
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:24,169
- Over 1200 a year, Phil.
- Perfect!

1013
01:17:24,169 --> 01:17:28,671
His body was too mangled to recover.
Case closed.

1014
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:31,381
Can I get more ice, please?

1015
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:33,048
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1016
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:37,717
- Stu, do you want this or not?
- Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

1017
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:48,054
I have a weakness for prostitutes. All
kinds, apparently.

1018
01:17:52,099 --> 01:17:56,767
- I have a demon in me!
- So what?

1019
01:17:58,101 --> 01:18:01,186
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

1020
01:18:01,186 --> 01:18:03,062
Just let her live her life without me.

1021
01:18:03,062 --> 01:18:04,437
Stu!

1022
01:18:04,437 --> 01:18:08,064
I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm
never coming back.

1023
01:18:08,064 --> 01:18:11,482
Gettin off the hamster wheel.

1024
01:18:11,482 --> 01:18:15,901
Gonna stay here in Bangkok.
I think I belong here.

1025
01:18:15,943 --> 01:18:19,361
Open up a little dentists office.

1026
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:24,113
Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

1027
01:18:25,446 --> 01:18:30,075
You sure about this?

1028
01:18:34,117 --> 01:18:37,910
Hey, what the crud!

1029
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:42,579
Powers out, Alan.

1030
01:18:43,497 --> 01:18:44,706
- Phil!
- Doug.

1031
01:18:44,748 --> 01:18:48,000
- I need answers, man.
- I know...

1032
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,041
Doug, who are you talking to?

1033
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,000
- What?
- Give me the phone!

1034
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,166
Lauren, no! That's a private...

1035
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,292
Who is this?

1036
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:56,295
- Lauren?
- Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

1037
01:18:56,295 --> 01:18:58,211
We lost your little brother.

1038
01:18:58,211 --> 01:19:02,964
- What?
- Bangkok has him now.

1039
01:19:08,634 --> 01:19:10,509
You gotta take the stairs.

1040
01:19:10,509 --> 01:19:15,053
You're in Bangkok?

1041
01:19:16,429 --> 01:19:19,013
Ooh, that's a finger!

1042
01:19:19,013 --> 01:19:21,097
Put Stu on the phone!

1043
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:24,683
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages
per year.

1044
01:19:24,683 --> 01:19:27,475
Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.

1045
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:28,934
- Water everywhere. Powers out.

1046
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:33,561
Come on, Stu, use that big Jewish brain

1047
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:36,688
Phil! Give me the phone!

1048
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,564
- It's Lauren! I got it! I'm handling it!
- I know.!

1049
01:19:38,564 --> 01:19:40,398
- Give me the fuckin...
- I can handle it, Stu!

1050
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:41,898
She's gonna break your heart!

1051
01:19:41,898 --> 01:19:44,483
Honey, sweetheart, it's me! I'm so sorry!

1052
01:19:44,483 --> 01:19:48,151
Stu? What the hell is going on? What does he
mean you lost Teddy?

1053
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:52,862
What? Is that what Phil said?
No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

1054
01:19:53,028 --> 01:19:56,947
But we're all good now. We heading back to the
hotel. We're gonna see you soon!

1055
01:19:56,947 --> 01:20:01,616
I love you so much! And I gotta go, but
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1056
01:20:04,742 --> 01:20:09,078
Stu!

1057
01:20:09,078 --> 01:20:11,913
- Stu!
- God!

1058
01:20:11,913 --> 01:20:14,581
Taxi!

1059
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:19,166
Come on, Alan!

1060
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,875
Hey, you mind filling us in!

1061
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:23,417
Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

1062
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:25,835
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1063
01:20:25,835 --> 01:20:28,920
- In a pool of water.
- But it didn't start out as water.

1064
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,588
No, it was ice.

1065
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:32,213
Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

1066
01:20:32,213 --> 01:20:34,757
...came back to the room. Put his finger
on ice and fell asleep.

1067
01:20:34,757 --> 01:20:35,756
Now what do you do if you wake up...

1068
01:20:35,756 --> 01:20:38,508
...and you find your finger floating in
a bowl of melted ice?

1069
01:20:38,508 --> 01:20:41,885
I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th
fuckin floor!

1070
01:20:41,885 --> 01:20:44,928
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1071
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:49,597
- Holy shit! Of course!
- He's at the ice machine.

1072
01:20:50,514 --> 01:20:55,223
Alan, no!

1073
01:20:55,391 --> 01:20:56,933
It's on ten!

1074
01:20:56,933 --> 01:20:59,643
- Sir, is the elevator stuck?
- ??.

1075
01:20:59,643 --> 01:21:04,395
- C'mon!
- Go, go, go!

1076
01:21:05,146 --> 01:21:07,479
Hey, Teddy!

1077
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:12,148
Look out, look out!

1078
01:21:17,859 --> 01:21:21,069
- Teddy!
- You're ok!

1079
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:24,029
Teddy, you okay? You ok, man?

1080
01:21:24,029 --> 01:21:27,156
- Where am I?
- You're in an elevator, in the middle of Bangkok.

1081
01:21:27,156 --> 01:21:29,406
But we're gonna get you outta here. It's
gonna be fine.

1082
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:34,117
Hey Stu, nice tattoo.

1083
01:21:34,826 --> 01:21:35,992
Thanks, man.

1084
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:38,244
Alright, let's do this! C'mon, c'mon!

1085
01:21:38,244 --> 01:21:42,996
Tell him we found him.
Yeah, I know. But we're on our way. Ok, bye!

1086
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:49,666
Alright, guests are arriving, people starting
to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

1087
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:52,918
- How?
- I don't know, with a taxi?

1088
01:21:52,918 --> 01:21:54,460
- Chow's speed boat.
- What?

1089
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,753
Last think I remember, was getting off
Chow's speed boat.

1090
01:21:56,753 --> 01:22:01,171
- Chow has a speed boat?
- "The Perfect Life".

1091
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:05,881
C'mon!

1092
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:09,800
Stu, get that back line.

1093
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,510
Good jump, Phil!

1094
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,719
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1095
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:18,596
- You sure you know how to drive this thing?

1096
01:22:18,596 --> 01:22:23,348
Please, I was raised in a yacht club. I
know what I'm doing.

1097
01:22:43,857 --> 01:22:46,233
You know where we're going?

1098
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:48,109
Leave it to the Captain!

1099
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:51,403
Oh fuck you, Alan!

1100
01:22:51,403 --> 01:22:55,071
Do you know where we're going, Captain?

1101
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,697
Affirmative cadet!
We're going south.

1102
01:22:57,697 --> 01:23:02,448
- We're in the Gulf of Thailand.
- Good.

1103
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:25,626
Hey! You okay?

1104
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:29,336
- Feeling a little better.
- Alright!

1105
01:23:29,336 --> 01:23:33,963
Listen Teddy. I'm really sorry! We didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

1106
01:23:34,339 --> 01:23:39,008
It's funny. I can't remember anything
But... when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

1107
01:23:44,301 --> 01:23:47,094
Yeah!

1108
01:23:47,094 --> 01:23:50,722
By the way... Do you have any idea
where my finger is?

1109
01:23:50,722 --> 01:23:55,265
Yeah, we gave it to a drug dealing
monkey.

1110
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:58,308
Bangkok...

1111
01:23:58,308 --> 01:24:02,935
Yeah, right... fuckin Bangkok!

1112
01:24:15,274 --> 01:24:17,317
I apologize. There will be no wedding!

1113
01:24:17,317 --> 01:24:19,359
He is on his way. He will be here...

1114
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:23,945
Please, if you will all move to the bar.
We are going to clear this area.

1115
01:24:23,945 --> 01:24:28,197
Please!

1116
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:32,782
I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.

1117
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:39,118
Look! There they are!

1118
01:24:40,453 --> 01:24:45,162
Stu!

1119
01:24:47,622 --> 01:24:50,373
- Alan, there's no dock.
- Just hang on!

1120
01:24:50,373 --> 01:24:53,125
- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat!
- Hang on!

1121
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:55,875
- Is that Alan driving the boat?
- What?

1122
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:59,752
Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

1123
01:24:59,752 --> 01:25:01,920
Oh my god!

1124
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,047
Turn the boat!

1125
01:25:04,047 --> 01:25:05,505
Everyone back up a little bit here.

1126
01:25:05,505 --> 01:25:10,174
Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

1127
01:25:24,013 --> 01:25:28,432
Hi! Hi everybody!

1128
01:25:28,432 --> 01:25:33,143
Came in a little hotter than we planned.
I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1129
01:25:33,685 --> 01:25:35,936
Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll
be fine.

1130
01:25:35,936 --> 01:25:37,895
- Baby!
- Oh my god!

1131
01:25:37,895 --> 01:25:41,272
I'm so happy to see you!

1132
01:25:41,272 --> 01:25:45,898
- Teddy! Teddy here.
- Hi, Dad!

1133
01:25:46,233 --> 01:25:49,859
- You alright?
- Yeah, ok.

1134
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:52,610
- Your hand!
- I know.

1135
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:56,695
We had an accident. I'm ok.

1136
01:25:56,695 --> 01:25:57,904
This is your fault!

1137
01:25:57,904 --> 01:26:02,615
- Dad.
- He's right. I have not been completely honest.

1138
01:26:02,739 --> 01:26:04,239
- Stu? Don't do this.
-Yeah?

1139
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,950
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1140
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:11,619
You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

1141
01:26:11,786 --> 01:26:16,412
I'm not some weird, milky, ricy, watery
that you feed to infants and old people, ok!

1142
01:26:19,206 --> 01:26:23,875
Maybe I would be if you added some
cayenne pepper!

1143
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,251
I wish I was a boring dentist...

1144
01:26:27,251 --> 01:26:29,418
...who had a boring life and boring friends...

1145
01:26:29,418 --> 01:26:31,878
... but I don't and I'm not.

1146
01:26:31,878 --> 01:26:34,296
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1147
01:26:34,296 --> 01:26:37,673
It's not weird. It's pretty cool
actually. No membership fees.

1148
01:26:37,673 --> 01:26:40,298
I've had enough of this. Come here.

1149
01:26:40,298 --> 01:26:44,509
Whoa! Here's the deal man.

1150
01:26:44,509 --> 01:26:48,219
- I got a dark side!

1151
01:26:48,219 --> 01:26:50,971
There's a demon in me!

1152
01:26:50,971 --> 01:26:53,638
It's true, he has semen in him.

1153
01:26:53,638 --> 01:26:55,348
I said demon.

1154
01:26:55,348 --> 01:27:00,099
- But you also have semen in you, remember?
- Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1155
01:27:01,809 --> 01:27:06,520
The point is, this demon takes me to
some pretty weird places.

1156
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:11,147
We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

1157
01:27:11,147 --> 01:27:15,065
But that same demon took us to
hell and back to find him.

1158
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:17,649
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1159
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:22,276
Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

1160
01:27:25,028 --> 01:27:29,154
I love your daughter, and I'm
gonna marry her.

1161
01:27:29,154 --> 01:27:33,157
- Unless you have any problem with that?
- I'm good.

1162
01:27:33,157 --> 01:27:37,825
But all that said, it would actually mean
a great deal to both of us...

1163
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:42,869
...if we could just get your mother fucking
blessing!

1164
01:27:57,501 --> 01:28:00,085
Hey, Alan...

1165
01:28:00,085 --> 01:28:04,503
- That looks pretty cool shaved.
- Thanks, Phil.

1166
01:28:04,503 --> 01:28:06,380
You should shave your head too.

1167
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:11,007
- Why would I do that?
- Well than we would look exactly alike.

1168
01:28:21,053 --> 01:28:25,764
- Take good care of my daughter, Stu.
- I will.

1169
01:28:32,392 --> 01:28:34,892
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with
the boat.

1170
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:39,353
Just happy you're here.

1171
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:43,063
And don't worry about the tattoo. I'm gonna
have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

1172
01:28:43,063 --> 01:28:47,649
- That's ok. I can get used to it.
- Really?

1173
01:28:49,983 --> 01:28:52,193
But for now, let's switch sides?

1174
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:55,652
- Yeah, ok.
- Thank you.

1175
01:28:55,652 --> 01:28:58,320
Much better.

1176
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,197
Dear family and friends. On behalf of Stu and Lauren...

1177
01:29:02,197 --> 01:29:06,742
...I welcome all of you, to this
marriage celebration.

1178
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:11,409
We are here today to...

1179
01:30:02,683 --> 01:30:05,434
Hey buddy. Can you hold on for a second.

1180
01:30:05,434 --> 01:30:10,021
Thank you.

1181
01:30:14,021 --> 01:30:17,939
Hello? Hi everyone!

1182
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:20,482
My name's Alan Garner.

1183
01:30:20,482 --> 01:30:25,193
I want to thank the Asiatic people for
allowing us in your land.

1184
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:32,238
I wanted to say that, um, I'm really
happy to be here...

1185
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:36,866
...and I have a wedding gift to present
to Lauren and Stu.

1186
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,991
And um, a lot of thought has gone into this...

1187
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:44,660
...and I hope that you appreciate it as
much as I did, or going to.

1188
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:49,329
Okay, guys!

1189
01:31:03,127 --> 01:31:07,796
Oh, fuck!

1190
01:31:25,178 --> 01:31:28,305
Alan!

1191
01:31:28,305 --> 01:31:30,473
What the fuck?

1192
01:31:30,473 --> 01:31:33,724
- So what do ya think?
- That's insane! How did you do that?

1193
01:31:33,724 --> 01:31:35,434
My dad had to make a lot of calls.

1194
01:31:35,434 --> 01:31:39,519
I told Mike that you gotta do it. It's
for my third best friend.

1195
01:31:39,519 --> 01:31:43,563
Alan, it's amazing!
I love it! Thank you so much!

1196
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:47,523
We only have him for tonight. We don't
have him permanently.

1197
01:31:47,523 --> 01:31:52,066
Understood!

1198
01:32:04,155 --> 01:32:08,157
- You do a lot of public speaking, Alan?
- I barely ??

1199
01:32:08,157 --> 01:32:12,868
Mike, you were great. It's true, that
was incredible.

1200
01:32:12,951 --> 01:32:15,910
Thanks, guys. That means a lot, really!

1201
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:19,578
By the way, you really need to remove that
fuckin tattoo from your face!

1202
01:32:19,578 --> 01:32:23,622
Yeah! On it!

1203
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:25,915
Sorry about the last minute change up
to the performance, Mike.

1204
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:27,708
- Don't worry, Alan.
- What are you talking about?

1205
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:30,376
Well he was originally supposed to sing
"Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers...

1206
01:32:30,376 --> 01:32:33,210
...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

1207
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,628
Hey guys. You're not gonna believe this.

1208
01:32:35,628 --> 01:32:38,004
- Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

1209
01:32:38,004 --> 01:32:39,963
How come you never tried calling us?

1210
01:32:39,963 --> 01:32:41,755
It's been dead for two days.

1211
01:32:41,755 --> 01:32:44,132
