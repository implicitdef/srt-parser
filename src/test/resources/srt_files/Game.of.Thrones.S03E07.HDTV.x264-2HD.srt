<i>Our father has</i>

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,101
that his alliance
with the North can continue

3
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:07,533
if his terms are met.

4
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:09,224
<i>Lord Frey requires</i>
<i>Lord Edmure</i>

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,547
<i>to wed one</i>
<i>of his daughters.</i>

6
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:13,144
It's hard to say
which of the four of us

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,837
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

8
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:16,066
<i>Probably Sansa.</i>

9
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:18,195
<i>Though Loras</i>
<i>will certainly come to know</i>

10
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:20,422
a deep and singular
misery.

11
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:21,697
<i>Who's going to tell her?</i>

12
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,153
Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.

13
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:25,116
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,445
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

15
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:30,874
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

16
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:33,970
as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

17
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:35,637
<i>And you will swear</i>
<i>to tell your father</i>

18
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,736
<i>that I had nothing to do</i>
<i>with your maiming.</i>

19
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,903
- My lady.
- She won't be going with you.

20
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:51,704
Let's play a game.

21
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,506
Which body part
do you need the least?

22
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:58,226
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

23
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,374
Six.

24
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,909
He sent you to us
for a reason.

25
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:02,609
You have someone
He needs.

26
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:04,143
You told me
I could be one of you.

27
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:05,809
<i>You told me</i>
<i>this was a brotherhood.</i>

28
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:07,810
You will make kings
rise and fall.

29
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:09,811
The visions
take their toll.

30
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:11,711
He's having one now?

31
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,912
- I saw Jon Snow.
- At Castle Black?

32
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:15,879
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall,

33
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,946
surrounded by enemies.

How far are we?

38
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,333
About a week, I think.

39
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,902
You think?
You don't know?

40
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:47,605
When we went to Castle Black,
we took the kingsroad.

41
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,340
You and your roads.

42
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,842
Is that how you lot
do your fighting?

43
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:56,278
You march down the road banging
drums and waving banners?

44
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:57,946
Most of the time, yes.

45

How do the men holding
the banners fight?

46
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:03,652
They don't, really.

47
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:07,723
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

48
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:10,826
And the drummers--
is that a great honor, too?

49
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:13,862
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

50
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:15,531
So what good are they?

51
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:18,968
- They help the men march.
- How?

52
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:22,572
Well, it's--
it's the rhythm.

53
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:25,108
Oh, you mean right foot,
left foot,

54
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:27,143
right foot,
left foot, right foot?

You need help
remembering that?

56

When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

57
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:37,121
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

58
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,223
No.

59
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:42,526
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,996
the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

61
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,632
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

62
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,536
She's right, you don't.

63
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,841
I know you cut me
loose on the Wall.

64
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,609
Cut her loose, too.

65
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,677
Do you see her
sulking about it?

66
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:06,781
That's because she understands
the way things are.

67
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:11,386
And are you gonna
share it with me?

68
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,756
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

69
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,158
People work together
when it suits them.

70
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,860
They're loyal
when it suits them.

71
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,396
They love each other
when it suits them.

72
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,299
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

73
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:26,469
She knows that,
you don't.

74
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:29,906
Which is why you'll
never hold onto her.

75
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:48,391
That rain will cost us
another day.

76
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:52,796
Frey will wait.
He knows we're coming.

77
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,998
Lord Walder is prickly
by nature.

78
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:57,400
Prickly?
That what you call it?

79
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,769
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

80
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:02,438
- Yes, and that is why--
- I've seen wet shits

81
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:05,641
<i>I liked better</i>
<i>than Walder Frey.</i>

82
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,178
Apologies, Your Grace.

83
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,281
Spent too many years around
lancers and pikemen.

84
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:16,117
I've spent the last two years
nursing wounded men,

85
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:18,319
watching them
bleed and die.

86
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:20,388
I'm not afraid
of wet shits.

87
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,659
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

88
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,361
He can take it
as he likes.

89
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,497
He's getting
the wedding he wanted.

90
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:30,165
He's getting a wedding.

91
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,501
It was a king he wanted.

92
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:34,537
<i>Edmure is the best match</i>
<i>a Frey has had</i>

93

94
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:39,208
We should all
get some sleep.

95
00:07:58,355 --> 00:07:59,889
If you don't put
some clothes on,

96
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:02,425
I can't promise
I won't attack you again.

97
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,660
Attack. Attack.

98
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,619
<i>Who are you writing?</i>

99
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:31,055
My mother.

100
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:35,626
- Is that Valyrian?
- Gaaa.

101
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,461
Gaaa?

102
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,404
Say hello for me.

103
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,773
<i>Rytsas.</i>

104
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:52,010
<i>"Ritsas."</i>

105
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:54,045
That was close enough.

106
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:59,718
Does she know
her daughter's a queen?

107
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,854
Not yet.

108
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:06,192
That will be
a surprise, I expect.

109
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:10,830
Many surprises for her.

110
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:17,504
How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war

111
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,840
when you're over there
looking like that?

112
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:27,047
Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?

113
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:29,650
<i>When all this is over?</i>

114
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,919
I will.

115
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:34,322
I promise.

116
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:42,030
<i>I know she'd love</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

117
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,166
And her grandchild.

118
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:50,972
What, now?

119
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,046
Are you certain?

120
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:02,217
Are you angry with me?

121
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,019
Angry?

122
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,424
You're my queen.

123
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,964
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

124
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,501
Maybe one of each.

125
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,536
Don't get greedy.

126
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,781
Can you leave the war
for one night?

127
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,186
I love you.

128
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,091
Do you hear me?

129
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,627
I love you.

130
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,711
Most men fuck like dogs.

131
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,348
No grace, no skill.

132
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:08,417
A few dozen thrusts
and done.

133
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:11,553
You need to be patient.
Give her time.

134
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,855
Your cock shouldn't
go near her

135
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,191
till she's slick
as a baby seal.

136
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:19,960
And then you go inside,

137
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,629
<i>but slowly.</i>

138
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:25,099
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

139
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,701
Come on!

140
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:30,171
Hey, come on.

141
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,485
You think he loves you,
is that it?

142
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,355
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady

143
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,858
and live with you
in some castle?

144
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,527
No, he didn't
tell me anything.

145
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,296
He barely talks.

146
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,532
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

147
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,734
giggling like
a pair of girls.

148
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,635
What, you're jealous?

149
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,571
Of course I'm jealous.

150
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,439
You should be
with one of your own.

151
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,274
And you're one of my own?

152
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,068
I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.

153
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:11,278
You would
if you were mine.

154
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,982
I'd tell you
that you're beautiful

155
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:19,353
and fierce and wild.

156
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:21,521
I'd be good to you.

157
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:26,459
You love him?

158
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,634
'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?

159
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:38,771
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

160
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,574
You think pretty
is gonna make you happy?

161
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,442
Don't touch me.

162
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:46,646
You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.

163
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:53,786
Growing up at Winterfell, all
I ever wanted was to escape,

164
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,957
to come here
to the capital.

165
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:00,626
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

166
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:04,130
and King's Landing
after dark--

167
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:08,668
all the candles burning
in all those windows.

168
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:12,838
I'm stupid.

169
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,341
A stupid little girl

170
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,344
with stupid dreams
who never learns.

171
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,312
Come on.

172
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:24,216
Come walk with me.

173
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:28,920
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

174
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:32,223
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

175
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,692
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

176
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,861
and so does my grandmother.

177
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:41,899
You would have been
happy at Highgarden.

178
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,467
But women in our position

179
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:46,504
must make the best
of our circumstances.

180
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:49,541
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

181
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:51,843
I have to marry him.

182
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:56,882
- Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
- No.

183
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,418
Has he been kind to you?

184
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:01,720
He's tried.

185
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,221
You don't want
him, though.

186
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,556
He's a Lannister.

187
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,192
Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

188
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:10,429
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:13,298
Here I am
complaining to you...

190
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:15,901
My son will be king.

191
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:17,403
Sons learn
from their mothers.

192
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:20,338
I plan to teach mine
a great deal.

193
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:23,175
And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,

194
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,146
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

195
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,048
and the North someday.

196
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:33,352
What?

197
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,854
My son...

198
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:37,989
with him.

199
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:42,761
I'll have to--

200
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,730
we'll have to--

201
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,699
If it's the pain
you're worried about--

202
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,934
I'm not afraid
of the pain.

203
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:51,070
Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.

204
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:52,705
What is it, then?

205
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:57,243
He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.

206
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,479
Especially with the scar.

207
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:01,914
He's a dwarf.

208
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:04,150
And Loras--

209
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,952
Loras.

210
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,191
Some women like tall men.

211
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,860
Some like short men.

212
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:15,663
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.

213
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,899
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,

214
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,302
pretty girls.

215
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:24,405
Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.

216
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:28,075
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

217
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,377
before we're old and gray.

218
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:33,447
Tyrion may surprise you.

219
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:37,184
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

220
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:40,454
And that's a good thing?

221
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:41,889
<i>It can be.</i>

222
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,691
We're very complicated,
you know.

223
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:46,060
Pleasing us
takes practice.

224
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,496
How do you know
all this?

225
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,931
Did your mother teach you?

226
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,970
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.

227
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,477
<i>She's a child.</i>

228
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,045
<i>She's a foot</i>
<i>taller than you.</i>

229
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,880
A tall child.

230
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,949
What's the youngest
you've ever had?

231
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,484
Not that young.

232
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,753
How much older?

233
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,522
Older.

234
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,659
You're a lord,
she's a lady.

235
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:18,527
And a beauty at that.

236
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,095
I don't see the problem.

237
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,398
Shae isn't going
to like it.

238
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,166
Shae is a whore.

239
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:26,803
Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?

240
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:29,906
How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?

241
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:32,876
I should never have
told you about that.

242
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,279
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

243
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:39,483
All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.

244
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,385
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

245
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,620
You can rule the North
in his name.

246
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:46,423
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

247
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:48,292
Two women to despise me

248
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:50,627
and a whole kingdom
to join them.

249
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,465
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

250
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,268
you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.

251
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:04,375
You want to fuck
that Stark girl.

252
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,010
<i>You just don't want</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

253
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:10,948
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

254
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:13,818
The ones already there
don't need company.

255
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:16,420
You pay me to kill people
who bother you.

256
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,325
Evil notions come free.

257
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:55,391
Your Grace.

258
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,527
Grandfather.

259
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:59,863
You wanted
to speak to me?

260
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,664
Yes.

261
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:05,702
I'd like a report on the meetings
of my small council.

262
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:07,805
You're welcome
to attend the meetings

263
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,041
of your small council,
Your Grace.

264
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:11,543
Any or all of them.

265
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:13,412
I've been very busy.

266
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:16,048
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

267
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:18,250
Of course.

268
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,820
You've been holding
the council meetings

269
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:25,423
in the Tower of the Hand instead of
the small council chamber.

270
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,125
I have, yes.

271
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:30,162
May I ask why?

272
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:33,198
The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.

273
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:36,401
To walk from there
to here would take time,

274
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:39,104
time I could otherwise
spend productively.

275
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,506
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

276
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,410
I would now have to climb
all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

277
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:03,729
We could arrange
to have you carried.

278
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,034
Tell me about
the Targaryen girl

279
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:12,103
in the east
and her dragons.

280
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,772
Where did you hear
about this?

281
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,274
Is it true?

282
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:18,376
Apparently so.

283
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:24,648
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

284
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,384
When I was
Hand of the King

285
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,653
under your father's
predecessor,

286
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:32,289
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

287
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:34,757
were kept in this room.

288
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,527
The skull
of the last of them

289
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,596
was right here.

290
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,066
It was the size
of an apple.

291
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,070
And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.

292
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:50,873
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged

293
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:54,076
died 300 years ago.

294
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,712
Curiosities on the far
side of the world

295
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,080
are no threat to us.

296
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:01,517
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

297
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:04,587
and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?

298
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,590
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

299
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,759
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

300
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,727
on matters about
which he knows nothing.

301
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:14,196
But I haven't
been counseled.

302
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:17,900
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

303
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:23,139
I should be consulted
about such things.

304
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:24,674
From now on,
I will see to it

305
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,776
that you are
appropriately consulted

306
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,078
on important matters

307
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:31,214
whenever necessary.

308
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:38,721
Your Grace.

309
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,768
Yunkai.

310
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,869
The Yellow City.

311
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,976
<i>The Yunkish train</i>
<i>bed slaves, not soldiers.</i>

312
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,045
We can defeat them.

313
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,514
On the field,
with ease.

314
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:09,283
But they won't
meet us on the field.

315
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:12,486
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

316
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,989
<i>If they're wise,</i>
<i>they'll hide behind those walls</i>

317
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,725
and chip away at us,
man by man.

318
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,729
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

319
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:24,999
We don't need
Yunkai, khaleesi.

320
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,703
Taking this city will not bring
you any closer to Westeros

321
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:30,005
or the Iron Throne.

322
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:35,110
How many slaves
are there in Yunkai?

323
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:39,115
200,000,
if not more.

324
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:43,152
Then we have 200,000 reasons
to take the city.

325
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,985
Now comes the noble
Razdal mo Eraz

326
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,456
of that ancient
and honorable house,

327
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:31,825
<i>master of men</i>
<i>and speaker to savages,</i>

328
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,462
<i>to offer terms of peace.</i>

329
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:37,764
Noble lord, you are
in the presence

330
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,667
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

331
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:43,336
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

332
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,538
<i>Khaleesi</i>
<i>of the Great Grass Sea,</i>

333
00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:48,908
<i>Breaker of Chains,</i>
<i>and Mother of Dragons.</i>

334
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:53,146
You may approach.
Sit.

335
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:04,856
Will the noble lord
take refreshment?

336
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:19,871
Ancient and glorious
is Yunkai.

337
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,539
Our empire was old

338
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:24,609
before dragons stirred
in old Valyria.

339
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:27,912
<i>Many an army has broken</i>
<i>against our walls.</i>

340
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:30,682
You shall find no easy
conquest here, khaleesi.

341
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,055
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.

342
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,057
I was told
to blood them early.

343
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:43,262
If blood is your desire,
blood shall flow.

344
00:24:44,364 --> 00:24:46,032
But why?

345
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:49,401
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

346
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:53,639
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

347
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:59,512
The wise masters of Yunkai
have sent a gift

348
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:01,180
for the silver queen.

349
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:11,591
There is far more than this awaiting
you on the deck of your ship.

350
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,659
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

351
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:16,496
As I said,
we are a generous people.

352
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,199
<i>You shall have</i>
<i>as many ships as you require.</i>

353
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,301
And what do you ask
in return?

354
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:25,538
All we ask is that
you make use of these ships.

355
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:28,074
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

356
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,977
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

357
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:36,250
I have a gift
for you as well.

358
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,653
- Your life.
- My life?

359
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,388
And the lives
of your wise masters.

360
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:44,992
But I also want
something in return.

361
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:48,596
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

362
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,699
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

363
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:53,534
clothing, and property
as they can carry

364
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:56,871
as payment
for their years of servitude.

365
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:58,939
Reject this gift,

366
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:01,341
and I shall
show you no mercy.

367
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:03,377
You are mad.

368
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,212
<i>We are not Astapor</i>
<i>or Qarth.</i>

369
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:08,448
We are Yunkai and we have
powerful friends.

370
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:12,219
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

371
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:15,222
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

372
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:17,591
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

373
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,362
You swore me
safe conduct.

374
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:26,266
I did, but my dragons
made no promises.

375
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,835
And you threatened
their mother.

376
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,038
Take the gold.

377
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:43,550
My gold.
You gave it to me, remember?

378
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,352
And I shall put it
to good use.

379
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,221
You'd be wise to do the same
with my gift to you.

380
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:49,957
Now get out.

381
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:56,630
The Yunkish
are a proud people.

382
00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:58,232
They will not bend.

383
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:01,235
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

384
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,304
He said he had
powerful friends.

385
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,139
Who was he talking about?

386
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:07,441
I don't know.

387
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,877
Find out.

388
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:27,328
Chains?

389
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:30,599
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

390
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,802
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

391
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:35,237
Golden chains.

392
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,875
You could buy
a ship with these.

393
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,643
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

394
00:27:40,678 --> 00:27:44,481
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not going anywhere.

395
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:48,618
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

396
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:53,089
I didn't ask
for this marriage.

397
00:27:53,124 --> 00:27:55,626
- I didn't want it.
- No?

398
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,962
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

399
00:27:57,996 --> 00:28:00,031
That doesn't mean that--

400
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,266
this is duty,
not desire.

401
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,869
Is that what you will tell yourself
when you fuck her?

402
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:07,005
I don't have a choice.
My father--

403
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,641
Does not rule
the world.

404
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,381
We can still go
across the Narrow Sea.

405
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:17,249
What would I do there?

406
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:19,017
Juggle?

407
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:22,154
I am a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

408
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:24,789
And I'm Shae
the funny whore.

409
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:28,693
My feelings for you
have not changed.

410
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,929
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

411
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:34,198
While I empty
her chamber pot

412
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:36,000
and lick your cock
when you're bored?

413
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:38,535
I swear to you
it will not be like that.

414
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,371
No?
What will it be like?

415
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:46,776
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

416
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,979
You will have
fine clothes,

417
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:51,782
guards to keep
you safe, servants.

418
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:56,254
Any children
we might have

419
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:58,222
will be
well provided for.

420
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:00,624
Children?
You think I want children

421
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,293
who can never see
their father?

422
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:03,894
Who would be killed
in their sleep

423
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:06,230
if their grandfather
found out about them?

424
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,131
Listen.

425
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,433
Listen to me, my lady.

426
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:12,802
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

427
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,072
You'll always
be my lady.

428
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:22,311
I'm your whore.

429
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:25,681
And when you are tired
of fucking me,

430
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:27,816
I will be nothing.

431
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:00,248
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

432
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:03,418
I should have been here.

433
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:07,322
After all the running
and fighting,

434
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:10,225
here I am,
back where I started.

435
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:12,494
Do you miss it?

436
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:15,496
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

437
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:18,433
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.

438
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:22,036
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

439
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,838
Your talent for fighting?

440
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:25,373
I'm lowborn.

441
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,642
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

442
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,510
Mine was a slave.

443
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:31,546
So was I.

444
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,582
Bought and sold,

445
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:35,584
scourged and branded,

446
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:37,886
until the Lord of Light
reached down,

447
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,021
took me in his hand
and raised me up.

448
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,425
I was born in Flea Bottom.

449
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,894
Your blood is noble.

450
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:50,199
Are you saying my father,

451
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:52,735
he was some lord or...

452
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,036
There.

453
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:56,305
Your father's house.

454
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:04,714
I'm just a bastard.

455
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:10,020
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

456
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:12,322
First of His Name,
King of the Andals

457
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:14,124
and the First Men.

458
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:17,828
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

459
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,998
There is power
in a king's blood.

460
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,348
Come sit
by the fire, child.

461
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:44,485
Not talking, eh?

462
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,688
That's a first.

463
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:49,056
I don't talk
to traitors.

464
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,227
I didn't like
giving up the boy.

465
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,929
But you did.

466
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:58,132
You took the gold
and you gave him up.

467
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,169
The Red God
is the one true god.

468
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,638
You've seen his power.

469
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,873
When he commands,
we obey.

470
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,910
He's not
my one true god.

471
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:14,447
No?
Who's yours?

472
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,718
Death.

473
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,432
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

474
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,935
- How many?
- <i>No more than 20.</i>

475
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,605
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

476
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:42,211
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

477
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:44,281
Yeah!

478
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,451
But what about Riverrun?

479
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:49,319
It's not south.
It's west of here.

480
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:51,555
It will still be west of here
two days from now.

481
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:54,725
- You swore.
- To take you home, and I will.

482
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,927
But we need
to do this first.

483
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:58,829
Why? So you can
steal their gold?

484
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:00,397
I swear to you,
this isn't--

485
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:03,067
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

486
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:04,735
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

487
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:08,139
You'll lie to anyone.
I hope the Lannisters kill you all.

488
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:11,209
One day you'll understand,
but now--

489
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:16,748
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

490
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:43,040
Kick all you like,
wolf girl.

491
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,543
Won't do you no good.

492
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,728
I thought you were gone.

493
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,897
Tomorrow.

494
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:13,236
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

495
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:17,807
Lord Bolton's traveling
tomorrow as well.

496
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:20,977
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

497
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:23,413
You're to remain here.

498
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,916
With Locke?

499
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:34,893
I owe you a debt.

500
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:40,698
When Catelyn Stark
released you,

501
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:43,435
we both made
a promise to her.

502
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,436
<i>Now it's your promise.</i>

503
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:48,172
You gave your word.

504
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:49,773
Keep it

505
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:52,776
and consider
the debt paid.

506
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,846
I will return the Stark
girls to their mother.

507
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:00,116
I swear it.

508
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:08,091
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

509
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:30,249
Here.
Let me.

510
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,559
It will take time.

511
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,333
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

512
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,102
<i>to give him back</i>
<i>his chain.</i>

513
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:51,004
My father will make him
Grand Maester

514
00:35:51,038 --> 00:35:53,506
if he grows me
a new hand.

515
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:57,444
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

516
00:35:59,146 --> 00:36:02,516
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

517
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,719
The Lannisters send
their regards.

518
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,994
Safe journey,
Kingslayer.

519
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,297
Nothing to say?

520
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:17,733
I liked you
better before.

521
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:21,069
I don't remember chopping
your balls off, too.

522
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:24,005
And don't you worry
about your friend.

523
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,175
We'll take
good care of her.

524
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,661
Shh.

525
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:12,852
Gentle, my lord.

526
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:15,087
Gentle.

527
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,666
Shh shh shh.

528
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,369
Myranda knows
what she's doing.

529
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:31,071
Let her.

530
00:37:32,173 --> 00:37:34,374
She trained
as a septa, only...

531
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:38,678
she had other urges.

532
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:42,549
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

533
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:45,619
Where is he?

534
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:47,153
Who, my lord?

535
00:37:47,188 --> 00:37:50,724
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

536
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:53,326
Please.

537
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:55,562
Don't you want us
to see it?

538
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:57,631
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.

539
00:37:57,665 --> 00:37:59,900
Everybody talks about it.

540
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:02,937
He sent you.

541
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:04,471
Who sent us?

542
00:38:04,506 --> 00:38:06,574
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy.

543
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:08,543
We heard so much
about it.

544
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,881
- Please.
- Oh!

545
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,451
There it is.

546
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,188
Oh.

547
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:21,891
Do you think
we're ugly?

548
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,959
He thinks we're ugly.

549
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:25,895
Well, he's been
through so much.

550
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,331
Look at his poor face.

551
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,334
Help me.

552
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:34,837
If he comes back...

553
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:39,676
We need to make him
feel better.

554
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,679
And how can we make
him feel better?

555
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:45,415
I have an idea.

556
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,572
Oh, she's shy.

557
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:12,609
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

558
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,813
Maybe he doesn't
know how we are.

559
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:30,426
Oh.

560
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:32,395
I felt something.

561
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:38,535
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

562
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:43,507
- As good as they say?
- Mmm.

563
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:55,552
And why should you
get all the fun?

564
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,732
What?
You like her better?

565
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,572
Plenty there
for both of us.

566
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,776
I was here first.

567
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:29,218
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

568
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:31,320
Terrible timing.

569
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:37,025
But I was getting jealous.

570
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:42,731
Well?

571
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:46,302
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

572
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:01,351
Everyone knows
you love girls.

573
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,322
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

574
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,937
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

575
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:21,941
Would you say it's
your most precious part?

576
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:28,281
Please.

577
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:31,250
No.

578
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:33,353
<i>No!</i>
<i>Mercy, please!</i>

579
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:35,355
<i>Please, mercy!</i>
<i>Mercy!</i>

580
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:38,158
This is mercy.

581
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:40,393
I'm not killing you.

582
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:44,498
<i>Just making</i>
<i>a few alterations.</i>

583
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:49,103
No! No! No!

584
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:50,939
Please, no! No!

585
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:54,342
No! No, please!
Please!

586
00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:58,579
You're gonna scare it off.

587
00:41:58,614 --> 00:42:01,482
I'm not gonna scare it.
I'm gonna kill it.

588
00:42:03,285 --> 00:42:04,885
It's too far away.

589
00:42:27,874 --> 00:42:29,975
Is that a palace?

590
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:34,446
It's a windmill.

591
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:37,216
Windmill.

592
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,753
Who built it?
Some king?

593
00:42:40,787 --> 00:42:43,122
Just the men
who used to live here.

594
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:44,757
<i>They must have been</i>
<i>great builders,</i>

595
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:47,026
<i>stacking stones so high.</i>

596
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,129
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

597
00:42:50,163 --> 00:42:53,065
"I'm Jon Snow
and I'm from Winterfell.

598
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,266
My daddy
was a fancy lord

599
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:57,236
and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

600
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,239
If you're impressed
by a windmill,

601
00:42:59,273 --> 00:43:02,242
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

602
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:04,111
What's swooning?

603
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:05,946
Fainting.

604
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:08,515
What's fainting?

605
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:13,387
When a girl sees blood
and collapses.

606
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:15,590
Why would a girl
see blood and collapse?

607
00:43:15,624 --> 00:43:18,459
Well...

608
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:20,694
not all girls
are like you.

609
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:23,898
Well, girls see
more blood than boys.

610
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,001
Or do you like girls
who swoon, Jon Snow?

611
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:29,769
Oh, a spider!

612
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:32,338
Save me, Jon Snow.

613
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:34,674
My dress is made
of the purest silk

614
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,076
from Tralalalaleeday.

615
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,678
I'd like to see you
in a silk dress.

616
00:43:41,815 --> 00:43:44,316
Would you?

617
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:49,322
So I could
tear it off you.

618
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:52,291
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress,

619
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,460
I'll blacken your eye.

620
00:44:01,101 --> 00:44:04,236
Maybe one day
I'll take you to Winterfell.

621
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:08,207
Or maybe one day
I'll take you there.

622
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:10,542
After we've taken
our land back.

623
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:15,347
Ygritte.

624
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:20,587
You won't win.

625
00:44:22,123 --> 00:44:24,424
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

626
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:27,661
- You know nothing--
- Six times in the last thousand years,

627
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:29,964
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

628
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:33,635
- Six times they failed.
- And how do you know that?

629
00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:35,570
Every boy in the North
knows it.

630
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:37,039
We grow up learning it.

631
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:38,440
Where the battles
were fought,

632
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:40,208
the names of the heroes,
who died where.

633
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:42,110
Six times you've invaded

634
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:45,313
and six times
you've failed.

635
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:47,348
The seventh
will be the same.

636
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:50,584
- Mance is different.
- You don't have the discipline.

637
00:44:50,618 --> 00:44:54,187
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

638
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,622
You don't know
how to fight together.

639
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:58,158
- You don't know that.
- I do.

640
00:44:58,192 --> 00:44:59,959
I know it.

641
00:44:59,993 --> 00:45:02,328
If you attack the Wall,
you'll die.

642
00:45:02,362 --> 00:45:04,263
All of you.

643
00:45:12,406 --> 00:45:14,540
All of <i>us.</i>

644
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:32,492
You're mine

645
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:35,061
as I'm yours.

646
00:45:35,095 --> 00:45:37,630
And if we die,
we die.

647
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:41,134
But first we'll live.

648
00:45:41,168 --> 00:45:45,138
Yes, first we'll live.

649
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:04,257
What's he going on about?

650
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:06,660
And how come he always
gets to sit and chat

651
00:46:06,694 --> 00:46:08,762
while we do all the work?

652
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:13,334
Hodor.

653
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,540
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

654
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:20,275
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

655
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:22,276
You think I can't
hear you every day?

656
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:23,945
Filling his head
with black magic.

657
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:26,981
<i>Talking about visions</i>
<i>and three-eyed ravens and worse.</i>

658
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:29,851
- Leave him alone.
- He can speak for himself.

659
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:31,586
I don't fill his head
with anything.

660
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,155
<i>So what do you</i>
<i>talk about?</i>

661
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,291
What's happening to him
and what that means.

662
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:39,893
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.

663
00:46:39,928 --> 00:46:41,495
It's not like that.

664
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:43,296
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>tell him all the answers.</i>

665
00:46:43,331 --> 00:46:45,699
<i>It would be much easier.</i>

666
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:48,501
I don't want you
talking to him anymore.

667
00:46:48,536 --> 00:46:50,003
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

668
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:52,972
- We're not going to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

669
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:56,508
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn't there.

670
00:46:56,543 --> 00:46:58,243
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

671
00:46:58,278 --> 00:46:59,912
Oh, no.
I'm not going back there.

672
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:03,015
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

673
00:47:04,751 --> 00:47:06,552
Look at me.

674
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:09,855
The raven's
been coming to me

675
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,258
ever since I fell
from that tower.

676
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:15,061
He wants me
to find him.

677
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:18,464
I don't have
my legs anymore.

678
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:20,400
This is what I have now.

679
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:22,602
You have a family.

680
00:47:22,636 --> 00:47:24,470
You need to go back
to Castle Black

681
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:27,273
so you can get back to them
where you belong.

682
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:30,277
What if I belong
in the North?

683
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:34,614
What if I fell from
that tower for a reason?

684
00:47:34,648 --> 00:47:36,850
Is that what
he's telling you?

685
00:47:36,884 --> 00:47:39,052
That it's all
for a reason?

686
00:47:39,086 --> 00:47:43,290
All these bad things happened because
the gods got big plans for you?

687
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:45,292
I wish it were true,
little lord.

688
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:49,497
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

689
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:51,799
You don't understand.
You don't know.

690
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,801
You don't know.
None of you know.

691
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:56,070
None of you
have been up there.

692
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:01,508
I had a man once.

693
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:03,277
A good man.

694
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,079
Bruni, his name was.

695
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:08,116
I was his
and he was mine.

696
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,118
But one night
Bruni disappears.

697
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:13,754
People said he left me,

698
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:15,122
but I knew him.

699
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:19,092
<i>He'd never leave me.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>

700
00:48:19,126 --> 00:48:21,495
I knew he'd come back.

701
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:25,265
And he did.

702
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:29,670
<i>He came in through</i>
<i>the back of the hut.</i>

703
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,507
Only it wasn't Bruni.

704
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,109
Not really.

705
00:48:35,144 --> 00:48:38,680
His skin was pale

706
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:42,083
like a dead man's.

707
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:44,953
His eyes bluer
than clear sky.

708
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,460
<i>He came at me,</i>

709
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,462
grabbed me by the neck

710
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,332
and squeezed so hard

711
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,202
I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

712
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,940
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I got the knife.</i>

713
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:05,877
<i>When I did, I stuck it</i>

714
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:08,613
deep into his heart.

715
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:14,552
And he hardly
seemed to notice.

716
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:20,258
<i>I had to burn our hut down</i>
<i>with him inside.</i>

717
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:25,396
I didn't ask the gods
what it meant.

718
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,166
I didn't need to.
I already knew.

719
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:32,369
<i>It meant the North</i>
<i>was no place for men to be.</i>

720
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:34,672
<i>Not anymore.</i>

721
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:39,244
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black

722
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:41,846
and no further.

723
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:51,989
How is the pain,
my lord?

724
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,094
What's the purpose
of an arm with no hand?

725
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,633
Well, we've stymied
the corruption.

726
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,470
Yes, we've stymied
the corruption.

727
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,572
You're a learned man.

728
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,207
All the good
it's done me.

729
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,409
You did well
sewing up this mess.

730
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,778
You're far better
at this sort of work

731
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,481
than Grand Maester
Pycelle.

732
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,117
Faint praise, my lord.

733
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:25,956
So why did the Citadel
take your chain?

734
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,957
Did you fondle
one boy too many?

735
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:31,261
No, my lord.
That's not my weakness.

736
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,031
What is?

737
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:38,835
Curiosity.

738
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,839
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

739
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,141
And the only way
to understand it

740
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,544
is to study the afflicted.

741
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:50,247
You performed experiments
on living men.

742
00:50:50,282 --> 00:50:52,149
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

743
00:50:52,184 --> 00:50:55,220
My studies
have given me insight

744
00:50:55,254 --> 00:50:56,922
that has saved
many lives.

745
00:50:56,956 --> 00:50:59,324
Dying paupers,
I assume.

746
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,927
Men with no families
to complain.

747
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:04,763
You found them moaning
in the poorhouse

748
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:07,232
and had them carted
back to your garret

749
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:10,535
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

750
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,004
How many men have
you killed, my lord?

751
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:14,673
I don't know.

752
00:51:14,707 --> 00:51:17,843
50? 100?

753
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:21,681
Countless.

754
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:23,717
Countless has
a nice ring to it.

755
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:26,053
And how many lives
have you saved?

756
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:28,922
Half a million.

757
00:51:30,024 --> 00:51:32,359
The population
of King's Landing.

758
00:51:37,466 --> 00:51:40,968
You were in charge
of the ravens at Harrenhal.

759
00:51:41,002 --> 00:51:45,205
Did you-- did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

760
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,841
A bird flew off
and a bird flew back.

761
00:51:49,076 --> 00:51:51,444
Lord Selwyn Tarth

762
00:51:51,479 --> 00:51:55,181
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.

763
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:59,052
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

764
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,623
Why not?

765
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:04,024
He's convinced Lord Tarth

766
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:06,760
owns all the sapphire
mines in Westeros.

767
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:10,498
He feels
he's being cheated.

768
00:52:10,532 --> 00:52:12,701
They'd be fools
to kill her.

769
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:15,170
These men have been
at war a long time.

770
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:17,372
Most of them
will be dead by winter.

771
00:52:17,407 --> 00:52:20,342
She'll be their
entertainment tonight.

772
00:52:20,376 --> 00:52:22,611
Beyond tonight,

773
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:24,913
I don't think
they care very much.

774
00:52:44,066 --> 00:52:46,468
We have to return
to Harrenhal.

775
00:52:46,502 --> 00:52:47,935
Why?

776
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,437
I've left
something behind.

777
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,072
Absolutely not.

778
00:52:51,106 --> 00:52:53,074
I've got orders
from Lord Bolton.

779
00:52:53,108 --> 00:52:54,642
And what are those orders?

780
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:58,179
To deliver you to your father
at King's Landing.

781
00:52:58,213 --> 00:53:00,448
You think you'll get
a reward.

782
00:53:02,484 --> 00:53:05,252
I serve Lord Bolton.

783
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:06,820
Any appreciation
your father--

784
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,188
You think
you're getting a reward.

785
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:09,522
Let me explain
something to you.

786
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:11,557
When my father sees me,
the first thing

787
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:13,959
he's going to ask
is what happened to my hand.

788
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:16,842
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

789
00:53:16,843 --> 00:53:17,582
I had nothing--

790
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:20,457
Or I could tell him
this man saved my life.

791
00:53:23,002 --> 00:53:25,371
We return
to Harrenhal now.

792
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:46,925
Whoa.

793
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:50,830
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

794
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:59,039
<i>♪ The bear, the bear</i>
<i>and the maiden fair ♪</i>

795

♪ He smelled that girl
in the summer air ♪

798
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:08,115
♪ The bear, the bear,
and the maiden fair! ♪

799
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:14,621
<i>Don't spare her.</i>

800
00:54:14,656 --> 00:54:17,190
<i>Don't spare her!</i>

801
00:54:18,893 --> 00:54:22,462
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

802
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:24,130
Stop running and fight.

803
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:33,207
A wooden sword?

804
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:36,044
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

805
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:37,846
We've only got
one bear.

806
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,514
I'll pay
her bloody ransom.

807
00:54:39,548 --> 00:54:41,516
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want.

808
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,151
Just get her
out of there.

809
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:45,553
All you lords and ladies

810
00:54:45,587 --> 00:54:48,489
still think that the only thing
that matters is gold.

811
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:51,926
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

812
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,029
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

813
00:54:55,063 --> 00:54:57,465
So go buy yourself
a golden hand

814
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:00,134
and fuck yourself
with it.

815
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:12,680
Ah!

816
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,554
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

817
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:33,900
What the fuck are you
doing to my bear?

818
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,835
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

819
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:38,904
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

820
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:44,342
Pull her up.

821
00:55:57,622 --> 00:55:59,456
Hold my legs.

822
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,913
Pull him up!

823
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:36,326
The bitch stays.

824
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,830
We're taking her
to King's Landing.

825
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,498
Unless you kill me.

826
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,736
She belongs to me.

827
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,672
Lord Bolton's orders.

828
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,475
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

829
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,210
Getting his pet rat
a reward

830
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,580
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

831
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:20,872
Well, we must
be on our way.

832
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,578
Sorry about
the sapphires.

833
