2
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,559
(indistinct voices)

3
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:20,782
Boy.

4
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:23,199
Lovely boy.

5
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:25,030
What do you want?

6
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,108
A man has a thirst.

7
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:29,526
The man does not drink
for a day and a night.

8
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,861
A boy could make a friend.

9
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,387
I have friends.

10
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:36,885
Give us a beer. Before I skin you.

11
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:39,354
A man does not choose his companions.

12
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:41,291
These two, they have no courtesy.

13
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,263
A man must ask forgiveness.

14
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:48,216
You're called Arry.

15
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,536
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.

16
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,144
Once of the Free City of Lorath.

17
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,069
Hey, you little shit.

18
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:59,029
Get us beer!

19
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:00,684
You should have asked nicely.

20
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,503
Come closer.

21
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:11,505
And I'll shove that stick up your
bunghole and fuck you bloody.

22
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,747
The boy has more courage than sense.

23
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:15,097
Come here!

24
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:17,603
Yoren said none of us were
should go near of those three.

25
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,188
They don't scare me.

26
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:20,995
Then you're stupid.

27
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:22,803
They scare me.

28
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:29,713
Would a gold collector look
this far from King's Landing?

29
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,852
What are you doing?

30
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:36,920
They're looking for me.

31
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:39,235
You're in command here?

32
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:42,405
You're a long way from home.

33
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,283
I asked you a question.

34
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:46,058
Aye, you did.

35
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,288
You asked without manners.

36
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:51,599
And I chose not to answer.

37
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,046
I have a royal warrant.

38
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,877
For one of these gutter
rats you're transporting.

39
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,901
Well the thing is,

40
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:06,798
these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.

41
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,939
That puts them beyond the
reach of kings and queens.

42
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:13,883
It's a funny thing.

43
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,099
People worry so much about their throats,

44
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,221
they forget about what's down low.

45
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:22,405
Now I sharpened this
blade before breakfast.

46
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:26,377
I could shave a spider's
arse if I wanted to.

47
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:28,208
Or,

48
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,748
I could nick this artery in your leg

49
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:35,377
and once it's nicked, there's no one
around here who knows how to un-nick it.

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,061
We'll just keep that.

51
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,258
Good steel is always needed on the wall.

52
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:45,869
Seems you have a choice.

53
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,960
You can die here at this
crossroads a long way from home.

54
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:52,729
Or you can go back to your
city and tell your masters

55
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,114
you didn't find what you were looking for.

56
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,319
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

57
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:05,817
He carries a bull's head helmet.

58
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:10,344
Anyone turning him over will
earn the King's reward.

59
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:13,510
We'll be back. With more men.

60
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,562
And I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

61
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,006
(Tyrion whistling)

62
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,488
(woman laughing)

63
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:52,443
My lord.

64
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:53,871
You make me wait a long time.

65
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:55,805
And your friend keeps me company.

66
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,453
We were just speaking of your bravery

67
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:01,373
in the victory against the
Stark auxiliary forces.

68
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,034
It was quite a battle.

69
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:08,203
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

70
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:11,423
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

71
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:14,291
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

72
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:18,967
To find such a lovely creature
working in your father's kitchen.

73
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,314
It almost beggars belief.

74
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,455
Strange things do happen.

75
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,234
You should taste her fish pie.

76
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,985
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

77
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,450
How can you tell?

78
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,934
I can always tell.

79
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,635
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

80
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,738
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

81
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:42,940
I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.

82
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,603
Friends are such an important part of life.

83
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,406
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

84
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:52,472
But rest easy my lord,

85
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:56,807
I am very good at keeping
secrets for my good friends.

86
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:59,455
Your discretion is legendary,

87
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:00,854
where your friends are concerned.

88
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:05,810
How unspeakable of me to go on and
on, when all you want to do is rest.

89
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,683
I will leave you.

90
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,448
Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.

91
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:14,293
The city is made brighter by your presence.

92
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,377
We have a council meeting, my lord.

93
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:21,395
I don't like threats.

94
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:23,538
Who threatened you?

95
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:26,473
I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

96
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:29,260
Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not.

97
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,339
Threaten me again and I will
have you thrown into the sea.

98
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:38,145
You might be disappointed in the results.

99
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,871
The storms come and go.

100
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:43,058
The big fish eat the little fish.

101
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,630
And I keep on paddling.

102
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:48,599
Come, my lord.

103
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,517
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

104
00:07:56,516 --> 00:08:00,073
From this time until the end of time,
we are not part of your realm,

105
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:03,410
but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North.

106
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,809
He has more spirit than his
father, I'll give him that.

107
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,672
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

108
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:16,830
Give him his father's bones back, at
least as a gesture of good faith.

109
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,228
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

110
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,827
I will, Your Grace.

111
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,347
Did you see my brother when
you were the Starks guest?

112
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:26,496
I did.

113
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:28,826
They have not broken his
spirit, Your Grace.

114
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,817
If you speak with him,

115
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:34,917
tell him he's not been forgotten.

116
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,886
I will, Your Grace.

117
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,117
Safe travels, cousin.

118
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,620
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

119
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,715
If that's everything?

120
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:50,511
A raven flew in this
morning from Castle Black.

121
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:52,809
Trouble with the wildlings?

122
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:55,318
That's why they're called wildlings.

123
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,397
Somewhat less wild these days.

124
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,245
It seems they've stopped killing each
other and started following this

125
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:02,632
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

126
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:06,612
Another king? How many is that now?
Five? I've lost count.

127
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:10,499
Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man The Wall.

128
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:13,835
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.

129
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:18,282
Cold winds are rising, and
the dead rise with them.

130
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:21,730
The northerners are a superstitious people.

131
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:25,662
According to the Commander, one of these
dead men attacked him in his chambers.

132
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,799
Mormont doesn't lie.

133
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:30,535
How do you kill a dead man?

134
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,069
Apparently you burn him.

135
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,352
One trip to The Wall and you come back

136
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:40,255
believing in grumpkins and snarks.

137
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,175
I don't know what I believe,

138
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,466
but here's a fact for you.

139
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,538
The Night's Watch is the
only thing that separates us

140
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:49,020
from what lies beyond the Wall.

141
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,762
I have every confidence the brave men of
the Night's Watch will protect us all.

142
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:56,983
Night, sir.

143
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:59,163
The gods wanted us to have dignity,

144
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,096
wouldn't make us fart when we died.

145
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,500
We fart when we die?

146
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,351
My blessed mother was holding her
own when she left this world.

147
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:12,159
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

148
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:16,153
(farting noises)

149
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:24,882
Seems a bit greedy for one
man to have so many wives.

150
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:27,436
We were having a serious discussion.

151
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,588
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

152
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,363
Would you look at that.

153
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,329
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

154
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,809
I prefer watching them come towards me.

155
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,149
I'm sure that's nice too.

156
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:43,972
Well, there was a milkmaid

157
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,773
named Violet on the next farm
over from where I grew up.

158
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:50,754
And we were wrestling together from
the time we were six years old.

159
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,568
And then we got older,

160
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:57,683
the wrestling, uh …changed.

161
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:00,044
You were with her?

162
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,087
How many times?

163
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,275
Well, as many times as I could.

164
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,739
Wish I'd grew up on a farm.

165
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:11,563
We need more potatoes.

166
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:13,702
I'll get another sack for the sludge.

167
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,692
Get the turnips too.

168
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:33,111
No, Ghost, no!

169
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:34,964
No.

170
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,846
Ghost, away. Shoo.
Shoo!

171
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,904
You all right?

172
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,253
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

173
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,458
Oh, oh. Right.

174
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,167
I'm sorry. I just wanted to
make sure you weren't hurt.

175
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:02,199
You're very brave.

176
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,472
What's he doing?

177
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,661
This is Gilly,

178
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:18,661
she's one of Craster's daughters.

179
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,795
Hello, Gilly. What's he doing?

180
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:22,054
Sam said you could help.

181
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:23,946
I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed...

182
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,095
She's pregnant.

183
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,616
We have to take her with us, when we leave.

184
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:35,692
What?

185
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,217
I know it sounds a bit mad.

186
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:40,059
No it doesn't sound a bit
mad, it's impossible.

187
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,007
- The Lord Commander...
- We are sworn to protect.

188
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:44,450
- Sam we can't take her.
- Please sir, please.

189
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,206
I can still run if I have to.

190
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:47,467
It's just not possible.

191
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:50,038
I'm going to have a baby,
if it's a boy I...

192
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:52,459
If it's a boy, what?

193
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:01,667
You want us to risk our lives for you,
and you won't even tell us why.

194
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,792
Why did you do that?

195
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,415
Do what, ask her a question?

196
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:11,924
- You were cruel.
- Cruel!?

197
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,550
Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

198
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,493
- I didn't touch her!
- No you just want to steal her,

199
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,079
what do you think Craster
cuts off for that?

200
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,626
I can't steal her,

201
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,416
she's a person not a goat.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,791
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

203
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,833
We can't take a girl with us.

204
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,058
Mormont wouldn't have it.
And even if he would,

205
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:35,645
what would we do with her?

206
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,633
Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?

207
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,091
I could try...

208
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:42,663
What? I've read about it.

209
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,590
A bit.

210
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,572
I'm sorry Sam,

211
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:51,098
we can't help her.

212
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:46,884
Khaleesi.

213
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:33,437
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

214
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,522
Who did this?

215
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:39,373
Khal Pono perhaps,

216
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,361
Khal Jhaqo...

217
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:44,330
They don't like the idea of a
woman leading a Khalasaar.

218
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,300
They will like it far less
when I'm done with them.

219
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:18,191
Is it as you remember my lord?

220
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:20,072
Looks smaller.

221
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:22,095
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

222
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:25,429
I remember my father's cabin, felt
like a palace when I was little.

223
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:27,509
Now look at it...

224
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:30,782
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

225
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,442
Who will?

226
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,353
Anyone who matters,

227
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:35,963
this is a big day for them.

228
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,173
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

229
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:42,050
It's a hard place the Iron Islands...

230
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,728
always has been.

231
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:45,807
It's cold and it's wet.

232
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:47,398
I love the cold and wet.

233
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:50,170
They say hard places breed hard men,

234
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:53,786
and hard men rule the world.

235
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,522
Then you'll be king before long.

236
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,705
Try smiling with your lips closed.

237
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,559
Hmm, better.

238
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,907
My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.

239
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:12,591
I don't blame him.

240
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:15,734
He says that you're all reavers and rapers.

241
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:17,758
And that no matter how many women you have,

242
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:19,450
you'll never be satis...

243
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,275
Quit talking about your father.

244
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:24,569
He's right about us.

245
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:27,877
Our wives from the Iron Islands,

246
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:31,608
they're for breeding.
That's not enough for us.

247
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:35,698
That's why we take saltwives
from the women we capture.

248
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:38,853
Capture me!
Take me with you when you go ashore.

249
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:42,897
- Make me your saltwife.
- Your place is on this ship.

250
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,801
Not after you leave.

251
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:48,942
Father will punish me.
He'll call me a whore.

252
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,326
I haven't paid you.

253
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,801
I barely touched her.

254
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:33,436
And you charge twice as much
as every other brothel.

255
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,281
- And this is what I get, crying.
- One moment, my friend.

256
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:37,336
A moment.

257
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:48,510
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

258
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,172
Ramka will take good care of you.

259
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,379
- Sorry my lord.
- Shhh.

260
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:25,937
Did he hurt you?

261
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,428
Not, my lord.

262
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,939
- It's Megan.
- Who?

263
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:37,668
She works for you.

264
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:44,083
She's the one, the girl whose,
they killed her baby.

265
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:49,095
Ah, yes, that was
poorly handled.

266
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:54,619
Sometimes those with the
most power have the least grace.

267
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,486
Can't stop thinking about it,

268
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,886
I can't sleep.

269
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,585
Her poor little baby.

270
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:07,953
You know you remind
me of another girl?

271
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:12,058
A lovely thing I once acquired
from an Elysium pleasure house.

272
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:16,288
Beautiful, like yourself,

273
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,986
and intelligent as yourself.

274
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:22,068
But she wasn't happy.

275
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:28,501
She cried, often.
I asked her why but,

276
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:33,219
we didn't have the kind of
rapport that you and I have.

277
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,475
Yes, it was quite sad.

278
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,553
Girls from Elysium pleasure
houses are expensive.

279
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,624
Extremely expensive.

280
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,862
And this one wasn't making me any money.

281
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:55,305
I hate bad investments.

282
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,474
Really, I do.

283
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:00,591
They haunt me.

284
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,753
I had no idea how to make her happy,

285
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,182
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

286
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,902
A very wealthy patron, he offered me
a tremendous amount of money

287
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:21,073
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

288
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:26,481
To use her in ways that
never occur to most men.

289
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:30,501
And you know what occurs to most men.

290
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:37,549
I wouldn't say he succeeded
in making her happy

291
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:42,892
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

292
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:53,038
Take tonight off.
Tomorrow, Megan's child

293
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,922
will see you tomorrow.

294
00:22:56,494 --> 00:22:58,136
Better be happy.

295
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,614
That makes me happy.

296
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,191
More wine?

297
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,475
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.

298
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:21,599
Leave us, Podrik.

299
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,339
I believe we know
how to pour our own wine.

300
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:28,103
Is that your new squire?
Could have found you a proper lad.

301
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,977
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

302
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:32,812
Hmm, that's a good red.

303
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:35,513
- Dornish?
- You know your wines, my lord.

304
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:36,311
That I do.

305
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,487
A fine dinner, my lord.

306
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:40,890
Call me Tyrion, please.

307
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:44,419
I'm sure you're getting used to
fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

308
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:46,536
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

309
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:49,367
Wars have been started for less.

310
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:51,768
I heard there was some trouble

311
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,517
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

312
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:56,417
Hmm. Nasty business,
had to be done.

313
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:57,430
Yes, of course.

314
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,078
City Watch must keep the peace.

315
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:03,574
Only, I hadn't realized peace
depended on killing babies.

316
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,760
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

317
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:08,690
Especially the queen's orders.

318
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:10,500
I never said they were the queen's orders.

319
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,422
No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?

320
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,238
- She's always been a jealous woman.
- You know your sister better than I do.

321
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,540
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister.

322
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,661
I don't listen to filth.

323
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:24,974
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

324
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,262
I suppose people
who do believe that filth,

325
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,095
consider Robert's bastards
to be better claimants

326
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,721
to the throne than
Cersei's children.

327
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:32,868
Joffrey is my king,
the rest doesn't interest me.

328
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,403
I appreciate your loyalty.

329
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:36,951
Tell me.

330
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:40,874
When your men slaughtered
Ned Stark's men in the throne room,

331
00:24:40,994 --> 00:24:42,936
did you give the order?

332
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:44,955
I did.

333
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:46,811
And I would again.

334
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:51,139
The man was a traitor.
He tried to buy my loyalty.

335
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,228
The fool.

336
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,134
He had no idea you
were already bought.

337
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:56,914
Are you drunk?

338
00:24:57,482 --> 00:24:59,799
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp.

339
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,008
I'm not questioning
your honor, Lord Janos.

340
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,455
I'm denying its existence.

341
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:08,232
You think I'll stand here and
take this from you, dwarf.

342
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,143
Dwarf?

343
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:10,918
You should have stopped at imp.

344
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:13,577
And yes, you will stand
here and take it from me,

345
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:15,761
unless you'd like to take
it from my friend here.

346
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,924
I intend to serve as Hand of the King
until my father returns from the war

347
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,348
and seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

348
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:25,249
well I just wouldn't feel
safe with you lurking about.

349
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:26,488
What are you…

350
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,565
My friends at court will not allow this.

351
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:29,487
The queen herself...

352
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:30,889
The queen regent.

353
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,061
And you're a fool to
believe she's your friend.

354
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,245
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

355
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:36,400
No, we shan't.

356
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:46,876
There's a ship leaving for
East Watch by the Sea tonight.

357
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:50,277
From there, I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

358
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,017
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

359
00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:54,837
I found it surprisingly beautiful,

360
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:58,818
in a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

361
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,277
The lads will escort you.

362
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:02,393
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

363
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:04,402
These men are under my command.

364
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:06,961
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

365
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:10,816
His name is Bronn and he is the
new commander of the City Watch.

366
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:12,534
Boys.

367
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,719
I have friends at court.

368
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:18,266
Powerful friends.

369
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:21,280
The king himself made me a lord.

370
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:27,584
To the new Commander.

371
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:40,257
If I told you to murder, an infant girl
say, still at her mother's breast,

372
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:43,430
would you do it without question?

373
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:47,402
Without question? No.

374
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:49,609
I'd ask how much.

375
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,975
If they come back, I say we yield.

376
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:10,556
Gendry's the one they want.

377
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,284
I don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

378
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,242
I'm not afraid of no battles.

379
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:16,858
If you got within a mile of a
battle, you'd fill your pants.

380
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:18,234
I've seen lots of battles.

381
00:27:18,632 --> 00:27:19,554
- I saw...
- Liar.

382
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,404
I saw a man kill another man just
outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

383
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:26,417
Stabbed him right in the neck.

384
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:28,749
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

385
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,694
They had armor on.

386
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,041
So?

387
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,657
So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.

388
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:35,635
No, it isn't.

389
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,866
What's a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

390
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,582
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

391
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:44,006
Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.

392
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,365
It's when they've got armor on.

393
00:27:48,485 --> 00:27:49,386
I already told you that.

394
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:52,043
A knight?

395
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:54,086
How'd you know he was a knight?

396
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:58,888
Well, cause they got armor on.

397
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,116
You don't have to be a
knight to have armor.

398
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,619
Any idiot can buy armor.

399
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:03,875
How'd you know?

400
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,188
Cause I sold armor.

401
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,487
What do the gold-clips want with you?

402
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:21,861
No idea.

403
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,164
You're a liar.

404
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,336
You shouldn't insult people
that are bigger than you.

405
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,603
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

406
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,442
No one gets to insult anyone.

407
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,095
No good's ever come of those questions.

408
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:33,387
No good's ever come?

409
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:35,942
You've asked questions before?

410
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:39,200
How can someone so small be
such a huge pain in my ass?

411
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:40,585
Were you asked questions?

412
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,125
The Hand of the King.
The Hands of the King.

413
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:50,231
Lord Arryn came first, a
few weeks before he died.

414
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:53,602
And then Lord Stark came, a
few weeks before he died.

415
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:55,184
Lord Stark.

416
00:28:56,216 --> 00:28:59,633
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

417
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:02,849
You'll probably be dead soon.

418
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:05,487
What did they ask about?

419
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,229
- My mom.
- Who's your mom?

420
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,045
Just my mom.

421
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,908
Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.

422
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,170
And who was your father?

423
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:16,160
He could be one of those gold-hatted
bastards, for all I know.

424
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:17,762
What about you, anyway?

425
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:20,092
I thought they were after you?

426
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:22,294
Why?

427
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:25,944
Did you kill someone?
Or is it just because you're a girl?

428
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:27,526
I'm not a girl!

429
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:28,571
Yes you are.

430
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:30,791
You think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

431
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,936
Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls.
Everyone knows that.

432
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:35,311
That's true. You're still a girl.

433
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:36,172
I am not!

434
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,028
Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss then.

435
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,058
I don't need to take a piss.

436
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:48,729
I'm in hot pike, aren't I now?

437
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:50,622
No one can know.

438
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:53,455
They won't. Not from me.

439
00:29:57,286 --> 00:29:58,372
My name's not Arry.

440
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:02,891
It's Arya. Of House Stark.

441
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:05,974
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

442
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:10,377
He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.

443
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:11,632
He was never a traitor.

444
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:13,535
Joffrey is a liar.

445
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:17,160
- So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
- No.

446
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:18,317
I mean yes.

447
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:20,366
My mother was a lady, and my sister.

448
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,611
You were a lord's daughter
and you lived in a castle.

449
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,560
Look, all that about cocks.
I should never have said that.

450
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,398
I've been pissing in front
of you and everything.

451
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:31,167
I should be calling you milady.

452
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:32,548
Do not call me milady.

453
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:33,538
As milady commands.

454
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:35,527
Well, that was unladylike.

455
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:04,991
What you carrying?

456
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:08,247
Pears and oranges.

457
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:09,869
Wine from the Arbor.

458
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,524
And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands.

459
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:19,903
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

460
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:24,383
Me.

461
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:27,615
Don't like wine.

462
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:29,487
Woman's drink.

463
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,194
I need to get to Pyke.

464
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:45,541
I'll find you a horse.

465
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:57,171
I'm heading that way.

466
00:31:58,071 --> 00:31:59,099
I can take you there.

467
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:01,467
I bet you can.

468
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:03,304
You been at sea long?

469
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,058
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

470
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:07,244
None like you.

471
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,713
You don't know what I'm like.

472
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:10,328
You don't know what you're like.

473
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:12,972
You need someone to teach you.

474
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:15,543
Know who I am?

475
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:18,958
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry.

476
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,565
Lord Greyjoy.

477
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:25,985
Have my things sent up to the castle.

478
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,078
You should give me the reins,
I'm a better rider than you.

479
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,281
I've been on horseback
for the last nine years.

480
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:51,862
Nine years. You still know
your way around a ship?

481
00:32:52,592 --> 00:32:54,373
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

482
00:32:54,851 --> 00:32:56,338
Don't you worry about my hands.

483
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,028
The sea's in my blood.

484
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:03,370
You'll never be in the sea if I
don't watch where I'm going.

485
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:05,702
I have a proposal for my father.

486
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:09,080
One that will make him king again.

487
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:10,866
And me after him.

488
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:15,915
You may stay at the castle
tonight, if you're lucky.

489
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,174
Is that an offer from my future king?

490
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:20,061
An order. From your future king.

491
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:24,716
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

492
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,814
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

493
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:41,764
Father.

494
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:44,954
Nine years, is it?

495
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:48,121
They took a frightened boy.

496
00:33:48,856 --> 00:33:50,141
What have they given back?

497
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,171
A man.

498
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:56,259
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

499
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:00,420
Stark had you longer than I did.

500
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:02,668
Lord Stark is gone.

501
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:07,361
And how do you feel about that?

502
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,007
What's done is done.

503
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:15,245
I've brought you a
proposal from Robb Stark.

504
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,712
Who gave you those clothes?

505
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:21,356
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

506
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,393
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

507
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:25,292
It will.

508
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,170
That bauble around your neck.

509
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:32,498
Did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?

510
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,001
I asked a question.

511
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:37,810
Did you pull it from the
neck of a corpse you made

512
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:41,762
or did you buy it to
match your fine clothes?

513
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:46,059
Iron or gold?

514
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,996
Gold.

515
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:57,284
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

516
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:02,337
My fears have come true.

517
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:04,905
The Starks have made you theirs.

518
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:06,633
My blood is salt and iron.

519
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:10,227
Yet, the Stark boy sends you
to me like a trained raven,

520
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:11,472
clutching his message.

521
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,512
The offer he makes, is one I proposed.

522
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:14,811
He heeds your counsel?

523
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,463
I've lived with him, hunted
with him, fought at his side,

524
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,775
he thinks of me as a brother.

525
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:24,040
No, not here, not in my hearing,
you will not name him brother.

526
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:27,885
This son of the man who put your
true brothers to the sword.

527
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:30,367
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

528
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:31,893
I forget nothing.

529
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:33,886
I remember my brothers.

530
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:37,542
And I remember when my father was a king.

531
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:54,711
I see.

532
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,981
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

533
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:01,282
and he will make me King of
the Iron Islands once again.

534
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:02,867
I will lead the attack myself.

535
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:04,090
Oh, you will?

536
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:07,202
I'm your son. Your only living heir.

537
00:36:07,776 --> 00:36:08,696
Who else?

538
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,531
I told you to wait outside.

539
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:16,773
How did you get past the guards?

540
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,010
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

541
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,584
My dear.

542
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:28,811
- Yara?
- So good to see you, brother.

543
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:32,659
This is a homecoming I'll
tell my grandchildren about.

544
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:36,909
She can't lead an attack.

545
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:37,867
And why not?

546
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:39,898
You're a woman.

547
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,115
You're the one in skirts.

548
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,732
This isn't Winterfell, boy.

549
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:45,802
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

550
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,491
after your new father killed him.

551
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:51,034
What's dead may never die.

552
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:55,823
The only night she's spent off these
islands has been spent on the sea.

553
00:36:56,778 --> 00:37:00,288
She's commanded men. She's killed men.

554
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:02,933
She knows who she is.

555
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:07,531
No man gives me a crown.

556
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,307
I pay the iron price.

557
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:12,863
I will take my crown.

558
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:14,773
That is who I am.

559
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:18,254
That is who we have always been.

560
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:25,187
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

561
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:27,208
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

562
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,879
You'll have your gold when we take
the treasury at King's Landing.

563
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:42,053
All these kings fighting for the throne
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

564
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,516
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

565
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:46,618
Because you're a smart gambler.

566
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:49,664
Stannis has proved himself in war.
Twice.

567
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:53,104
His baby brother has never
set foot on a battlefield.

568
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,404
Neither has the false king, Joffrey.

569
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:57,177
And yet, they both have larger armies.

570
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:58,670
Stannis has just begun the fight.

571
00:37:59,434 --> 00:38:01,725
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

572
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:06,856
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon.

573
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:08,172
Or more worthy of loyalty.

574
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:12,391
What is the world coming to when smugglers
must vouch for the honor of kings.

575
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:14,169
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

576
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,732
You think I'm insulted?

577
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:19,081
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

578
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:21,032
I don't sail for promises.

579
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:21,998
Of course you do.

580
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,948
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise.

581
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:27,112
A promise that somewhere on the seas,

582
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:29,192
somebody's got some gold and
you can take it from them.

583
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,603
That's a promise that always comes true.

584
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,430
As is mine.

585
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:33,876
You're not the young man, Salladhor.

586
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:37,778
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

587
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,883
Only the clever ones.

588
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:42,685
You want to spend your
last few years on the sea,

589
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:45,843
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Midanese silk merchants,

590
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:46,495
then go.

591
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:47,303
They're out there waiting for you.

592
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:48,808
That's easy.

593
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,299
What I'm offering you is hard.

594
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:56,349
Come with me and plunder the
greatest city in Westeros.

595
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,781
You'll be the richest man in Lysene.
And the most famous.

596
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:03,321
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

597
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:07,335
Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.

598
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:08,167
It is.

599
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:11,532
- One thing, I want the queen.
- The queen?

600
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:13,422
Cersei, I want her.

601
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:16,037
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships,

602
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,397
and if we don't drown at the
bottom of Blackwater Bay,

603
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:21,514
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I will fuck her well.

604
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:23,103
This war isn't about you.

605
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:26,693
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

606
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,573
I'm not going to rape her,
I'm going to fuck her.

607
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:31,159
As if she would just let you.

608
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:32,947
You don't know how persuasive I am.

609
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,085
I never tried to fuck you.

610
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:38,999
Stannis is the rightful king.

611
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,526
And the Lord of Light.

612
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,534
The one true god.

613
00:39:41,554 --> 00:39:43,146
I've been all over the world, my boy,

614
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:45,834
and everywhere I go, people
tell me about the true god.

615
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,717
They all think they found the right one.

616
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:50,913
The one true god is what's
between a woman's legs,

617
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,055
and better yet a queen's legs.

618
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,930
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

619
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:58,092
He's young yet.

620
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:00,966
I promise you the gold.

621
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:04,103
I promise you the glory.
I cannot promise you the queen.

622
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:08,753
You believe your king can win?

623
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:11,461
He is the one true king.

624
00:40:11,835 --> 00:40:13,330
You Westerosers are funny people.

625
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,704
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

626
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:20,530
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

627
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,330
You are the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

628
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,400
Make me rich.

629
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:29,148
Get me to the gates of
King's Landing and I will.

630
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:42,433
When will the King have a sail?

631
00:40:42,852 --> 00:40:44,366
As soon as his God wills it.

632
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:46,636
He's my God too, and yours...

633
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:48,880
but you were too blind to see.

634
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,754
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh you and your mother.

635
00:40:53,874 --> 00:40:55,213
It won't take long you
already know the letters.

636
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,602
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

637
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:59,166
I wish I had a God, truly!

638
00:40:59,286 --> 00:41:00,698
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men

639
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:04,314
pray to every God there is. Pray for wind,
pray for rain, pray for home,

640
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:06,761
- None of it works!
- But you always came home.

641
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,508
I wasn't praying, you know.

642
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,641
But I was.

643
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,568
Every night that you're at sea,

644
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:16,240
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

645
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:20,134
You want me to have a god, fine.

646
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,921
King Stannis is my god.

647
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:24,374
He raised me up and blessed
me with his trust.

648
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:25,906
He gave you a future

649
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,438
I could never have imagined.

650
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:29,333
You know how to read,
you'll be a knight someday.

651
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,185
You think your fire god commanded all that?

652
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:33,603
It was Stannis.

653
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:35,700
Only Stannis.

654
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:38,718
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

655
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:40,579
Don't tell him that.

656
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:45,146
Lord Janos Slynt was
Commander of the City Watch.

657
00:41:45,266 --> 00:41:46,660
You had no right to exile him.

658
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,453
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

659
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,891
You're serving as the King's
Hand until father gets here.

660
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:53,541
- I am Queen Regent.
- Listen to me, Queen Regent,

661
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,164
you're losing the people.

662
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:58,224
- Do you hear me?
- The people?

663
00:41:58,607 --> 00:41:59,974
You think I care?

664
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:03,375
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

665
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:08,271
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

666
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,006
And gold-plated foes
just gave them the rallying cry.

667
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:14,650
The Queen slaughters babies.

668
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:19,547
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

669
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,187
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

670
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,707
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

671
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,337
Did he tell you?

672
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:40,671
I imagine that would be even worse.

673
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,385
He did what needed to be done.

674
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:44,749
You want to be the Hand of the King?

675
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:45,916
You want to rule?

676
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:47,307
This is what ruling is!

677
00:42:47,427 --> 00:42:48,871
Lying on a bed of weeds,

678
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:52,599
ripping them out by the root one by one
before they strangle you in your sleep.

679
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,935
I'm no king, but I think there's
more to ruling that that.

680
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:56,521
I don't care what you think!

681
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:58,496
You've never taken it seriously.

682
00:42:58,616 --> 00:43:00,411
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

683
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:05,966
It's all fallen on me.

684
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:13,264
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

685
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:20,460
You're funny.

686
00:43:22,742 --> 00:43:25,494
You've always been funny.

687
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:30,025
But none of your jokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

688
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,844
You remember...

689
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:38,113
Back when you ripped my mother open on
your way out of her and she bled to death.

690
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:41,661
She was my mother too.

691
00:43:42,298 --> 00:43:43,468
Now they're gone,

692
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:47,475
for the sake of you.

693
00:43:50,576 --> 00:43:52,653
There's no bigger joke
in the world than that.

694
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:17,027
Your Grace.
Your Grace.

695
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:19,255
How did it fare with your pirate?

696
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:21,403
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.

697
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:24,142
30 ships, his men know how to fight.

698
00:44:24,652 --> 00:44:27,686
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

699
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:31,633
- Does seem the wiser choice.
- It won't be a choice this time.

700
00:44:32,847 --> 00:44:34,136
Do you trust him?

701
00:44:34,941 --> 00:44:37,787
Salladhor Saan is an old friend,
I've known him 30 years.

702
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:39,908
I've never trusted him.

703
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,184
Now once he gets the smell
of gold, he never stops.

704
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:46,728
Well if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

705
00:44:50,943 --> 00:44:52,313
Leave us.

706
00:44:58,444 --> 00:44:59,976
At once, Your Grace.

707
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:09,041
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

708
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:16,016
Come.

709
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,245
What did you say to him?

710
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:27,915
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

711
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:30,754
- Why?
- Because it is true.

712
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:33,803
You're troubled my king.

713
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:35,189
Yeah.

714
00:45:35,463 --> 00:45:38,362
These armies are but toys
for the Lord of Light.

715
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,077
Tell your lord to burn them then.

716
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,456
I tell him nothing!

717
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:45,570
I pray for his commands and I obey.

718
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:50,355
My little brother has a hundred
thousand men according to the scouts.

719
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:53,510
Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

720
00:45:53,865 --> 00:45:56,674
- You must have faith.
- Faith?

721
00:45:58,606 --> 00:46:02,930
In a real war, the side with the greater
number wins nine times out of ten.

722
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:04,817
Then we must be the ten.

723
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:07,670
I cannot defeat my brother in the field,

724
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:11,446
and I can't take King's Landing
without the men he stole.

725
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:16,907
I have seen the path to
victory in the flames.

726
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:21,963
At first, you must give
yourself to the Lord of Light.

727
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:24,845
I've said the words, damn you.

728
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,801
I burnt the idols.

729
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,530
You must give all of yourself.

730
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,289
I have a wife.

731
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:46,335
I took a vow.

732
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:49,527
She's sick.

733
00:46:50,585 --> 00:46:52,135
Weak.

734
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:54,953
Shut away in the tower.

735
00:46:56,302 --> 00:46:57,706
She disgusts you.

736
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,268
And she's giving you nothing.

737
00:47:04,362 --> 00:47:05,511
No sons.

738
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:08,365
Only stillborns.

739
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,334
Only death.

740
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:17,905
I will give you...

741
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:20,404
a son, my King.

742
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:24,507
A son?

743
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:15,810
