1
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,078
Ithought he was supposed
to have a breakfast date, right?

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,917
I mean, they told me
that last night.

3
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,082
Breakfast?
Is that on the sched?

4
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,421
It isn't,
but the lieutenant told me

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,085
that he'd be doing
breakfast with someone

6
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,594
down at the harbor.

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:29,754
I mean, if he ain't,

8
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,356
I could go get this gassed up
at the Fallsway.

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,867
I hate this detail, man.

10
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,064
It's off duty.
Lotsa perks.

11
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:42,598
All this stand around
and wait, you know?

12
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,610
Hoskins says
I do the one year,

13
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,441
and I'll make sergeant
on the next list.

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,606
Yeah. They told me,
careerwise,

15
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,115
you can't do better
than drive the mayor.

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,947
Shit, if you could
make rank the right way,

17
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,249
I'll still be working
Western drugs.

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,558
All right, fuck this,

19
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,191
I'm gonna go look
for the lieutenant.

20
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,223
Anyone comes looking,

21
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,931
I'm back up
on the second floor.

22
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:19,904
Sir?

23
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,072
I understood
that the mayor

24
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,742
might be going to, uh,
breakfast at the harbor?

25
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,250
With Kweisi.

26
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,583
But, um, that's up
in the air, I thought.

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,953
Would you happen to know
where Lieutenant Hoskins is?

28
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,806
Sir?

29
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,246
Lieutenant?

30
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,758
Umm...

31
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,053
You don't look happy,
Detective.

32
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,724
We're about
to raise some hell.

33
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,734
Maybe too much hell.

34
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,101
A state senator,
two councilmen,

35
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,003
the City Development Agency,

36
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,530
all those developers...

37
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,735
Princes of the city.

38
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,744
Lester, tell me
the thought hasn't

39
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,245
crossed your mind
that some kinda shit

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,180
could blow
back on us, man.

41
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,910
Do you know what
Theodore Roosevelt said

42
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,578
about hunting grizzly bears?

43
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,645
The thrill is in overcoming
your own fear.

44
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,884
What was the thrill
for the bear?

45
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,755
I should've run every one
of these subpoenas

46
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,785
by my front office.

47
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,263
That's not procedure.

48
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,166
Fuck procedure, Lester.

49
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,691
My boss is running
two points behind

50
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,000
in the polls with
the mayor's support.

51
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,028
How do you think
he's gonna do

52
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,199
if he pisses off Royce

53
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,708
and starts dropping off
incumbent tickets?

54
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,302
Why do you care?

55
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,371
If Demper thinks
I fucked him and he wins,

56
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,714
I will be at Central Booking
covering bail reviews.

57
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,048
If he loses to Bond,

58
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,713
a new front office comes
in and maybe they bounce

59
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,415
the white girl
back to a trial team

60
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,549
and give the Narcotics Division
to one of their own.

61
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,059
It's Baltimore, Lester.

62
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,221
We're missing
a couple of subpoenas.

63
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,753
We are?

64
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,732
Clay Davis
and Andy Krawczyk.

65
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,737
I'm holding those
till October.

66
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,238
Oh, the hell you are.

67
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,365
Lester...

68
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,739
we drop subpoenas
on either of those guys

69
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,573
three weeks
before the primary,

70
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,238
and all hell breaks loose.

71
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,009
That's what I'm sayin'!

72
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,915
Clay Davis is Royce's
deputy campaign chairman,

73
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,749
and the number-two man at
the City Legislative Caucus.

74
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,017
And Krawczyk is his
number-one fundraiser!

75
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,183
You're giving me resumes
and job titles.

76
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,090
I'm just following the money.

77
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,358
And we will follow it...
after the polls close.

78
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,524
We can drop a second batch
of subpoenas.

79
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,501
There is no reason to do
this now and risk--

80
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,026
A year ago, if we had gone
after these records,

81
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,369
City Hall would've
stomped on this unit

82
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,034
and the subpoenas.

83
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,533
And a month from now,
after Royce is reelected,

84
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,013
they'll do us
the same way.

85
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:26,280
But right now,
with the primary coming,

86
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,048
they gotta worry
about how they look,

87
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,884
how they behave.

88
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,753
Right now, they gotta
worry about scandal.

89
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,898
You told me you wanted
to do this a year ago,

90
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,594
but fresh cases
got in the way.

91
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,172
You told me that.

92
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,409
Oh.

93
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,913
Very clever, Lester.

94
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,472
You got it all figured, huh?

95
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,418
Me?

96
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,217
I'm just the police.

97
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,523
I saw the teachers' union
finally endorsed Royce.

98
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,756
You knew
they were gonna.

99
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,537
What time's
your first appearance?

100
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,697
Today?

101
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,537
I meet up with you guys
at the SoWeBo forum.

102
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,873
And tonight, it's me
and the kids next to Tommy

103
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,573
at the Roland Park fundraiser.

104
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,714
Better speed things along.

105
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,589
A kick in the ass
sometimes helps.

106
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:45,557
- B-5?
- No, Daddy, D-5.

107
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,395
You sure
you didn't say B-5?

108
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,231
D-5.
What did I hit?

109
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,759
Submarine.

110
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,234
Umm...

111
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,243
E-6.

112
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,608
Miss.

113
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,179
Just gimme 10 minutes.

114
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,514
You seen your
schedule today?

115
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,848
You ain't got
10 minutes.

116
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,013
Norman, I got
this pretty girl's

117
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,852
aircraft carrier boxed in.

118
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,849
- D-4.
- Ow! Hit.

119
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,521
Tommy,
for Christ's sakes.

120
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,792
Is there any way
that I can win?

121
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,197
With the numbers what they are,
is there any way at all?

122
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,702
Right, so if it's just a matter
of playing out the string,

123
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,862
then that's what
I'm gonna do.

124
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,371
That game's pretty much
over, Norman.

125
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,397
But this game--
this game right here--

126
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,070
this one could still
go either way.

127
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,039
H-11,
sweetheart.

128
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,673
Miss. D-3.

129
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,697
So I guess y'all getting
what y'all need?

130
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,363
- Brianna keepin' y'all close?
- She come up with it.

131
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,873
Money comin' through
every month like she say.

132
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,432
A'ight, 'cause I'm standin'
tall up in here.

133
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,239
They don't need
to worry about me

134
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,870
an' I ain't need
to worry about them.

135
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,746
- You a soldier, Bey.
- You know it.

136
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,148
Everything all right
with my fishes?

137
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,848
You'd tell me if
it wasn't, right?

138
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,881
The fish be fine.
I mean, they fish, right?

139
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,722
How I know how they
feelin' about shit?

140
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,728
- De'londa...
- They fine, Bey.

141
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,389
Ask Namond.

142
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,228
Cleaned the tank an' all,
like you say.

143
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,235
- Cleaned the filter, too.
- A'ight, a'ight.

144
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,361
Check you out, though.

145
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,735
Getting some fuzz
up there, huh?

146
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,797
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, whatever.

147
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,433
I know when I was
a little kid, boy,

148
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,307
I couldn't wait till
I started shaving.

149
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,972
One of the old heads
on the corner say,

150
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,743
"Hey, little man,
you wanna grow a 'stache?

151
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,409
Next time
you take a piss,

152
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,577
take some of that piss,

153
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,916
get it on
your fingertips,

154
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,113
do like this, here."

155
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,587
Eww! You do it?

156
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,750
You damn right I did it.

157
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,088
Shit.

158
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,957
What's going on with you,
though, son?

159
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,487
Ain't nothing.
School about to start.

160
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,328
So what about Bodie
and his boys?

161
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,164
They treatin' you right?

162
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,760
Yeah, he cool.

163
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,294
Boy, don't lie
to your father.

164
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,502
He don't even show up for work
half the damn time.

165
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,409
- Bodie told me.
- I missed a few days. That's all, Dad.

166
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,434
And what money
you do make,

167
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,038
you waste on nonsense.

168
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,106
And if you think
I'm gonna give you a dime

169
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,313
for your school clothes,
you better think again.

170
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,014
What Bodie
got you doin'?

171
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,317
I'm a runner,
most days.

172
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,119
Everybody got
to start somewhere.

173
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,251
You better listen
to your father.

174
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,091
He ain't tell you 'bout
that hair, though, huh?

175
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,325
Yeah, he said
I gotta get it cut.

176
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,559
I like it this way.

177
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,794
Even the white police
lookin' out from

178
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,529
three blocks away gonna
be able to spot you

179
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,503
from every other nigga
out there.

180
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,506
They gonna hop out and say,
"Look at the boy over there

181
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,304
with the pretty-ass
ponytail. Get him."

182
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,311
You think
I'm bullshitting.

183
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,405
Either you real out there,
or you ain't, Nay.

184
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,609
You see what I'm sayin'?

185
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,590
Let me get some!

186
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,058
Hey, yo! Over here!

187
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,924
- Whoa! $100!
- Thanks, mister!

188
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,628
- Thank you, Mr. Marlo!
- Thank you!

189
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,299
That's my money, yo!

190
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,138
Your name gonna
ring out, man.

191
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,743
Manuel...

192
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,725
Boy, you talk that shit
better'n me

193
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,132
and I been dealin' with
these Mexicans for years now.

194
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,396
Yeah, I don't think
they would call

195
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,233
what I'm speakin'
Spanish, man.

196
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,239
Just a dirty word
or two here or there.

197
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,400
Yeah, well. Once you can
talk to these cats,

198
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,910
the only thing you need
then is a truck, man.

199
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,173
Could be runnin'
your own crew,

200
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,181
pickin' up fresh clients.

201
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,739
I mean,
if we put in together

202
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,307
we could be coverin'
twice the ground,

203
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,012
makin' twice as much.

204
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,580
Nah, man, I got
other obligations.

205
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,851
Oh, right.

206
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,553
You set to be
the new Angelo Dundee.

207
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,152
I near forgot.

208
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,434
I thought
you already went up

209
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,598
to Mondawmin to get
your school shit, man.

210
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,267
Yeah,
but not all of it.

211
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,434
And my boy,

212
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,602
he need to pay
for his own shit

213
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,906
and his little brother, too.

214
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,934
The fuck this look like,

215
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,880
a Social Services office?

216
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,507
You want a check,
go the fuck up Rosemont.

217
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,983
Come on, man,
I'll work for it.

218
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,047
Nay, I took you on outta respect
for your father,

219
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,716
a'ight, but I can't go hirin'

220
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,850
the whole damn neighborhood.

221
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,882
You can have
my job until

222
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,724
you get enough
for you an' Bug.

223
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,129
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, work for y'all, work for me, yo.

224
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,396
Po-po.
Step the fuck off.

225
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,806
Looking for your man Lex.

226
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,007
I see his broom,
but I don't see him.

227
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,640
Where's your
number two been at?

228
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,481
- I ain't seen him.
- Since when?

229
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,953
I thought we were
on better terms.

230
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,080
Or do you want me
rolling past

231
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,250
Iookin' for Lex
every 15 minutes?

232
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,157
He come past,
I'll call you.

233
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,353
I will!

234
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,576
If he come past.

235
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,715
Oh no, I don't know.

236
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,546
They're spinning
their wheels.

237
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,246
You know,
poor Tony Gray,

238
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,050
pulling 20%
of the black vote.

239
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,557
It's embarrassing.

240
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,718
Well, who knows
what the fuck

241
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,056
Carcetti's
trying to prove?

242
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,823
But I tell you,
at the end of this thing,

243
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,559
he's gonna regret getting
on the wrong side of me.

244
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,896
Mm-hmm.

245
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,562
A'ight, now.
I got what you need, boy,

246
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,072
clean tees,
any sizes, huh?

247
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,869
Lookin' for socks, briefs,

248
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,672
you lookin' for dice,
Zippos, cards--

249
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,736
come on over
to the Rollin' Emporium.

250
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,076
You ain't gotta
walk to Rite-Aid.

251
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,911
Shit, Rite-Aid
comin' to y'all.

252
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,280
What can I get you, baby?

253
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,080
Fresh dice
an' a pack of Trojans.

254
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,417
- All righty.
- You got Philly Blunts, too?

255
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,581
Bubbles got it all, dawg.

256
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,557
I'm the one-stop shop.

257
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,082
- How much is that?
- Six an' a bit.

258
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,095
Thank you.
Thank you kindly.

259
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,858
Yes, sir, I see
what you're lookin' at.

260
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,490
Two a deck,
name brand.

261
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,521
You can't beat that price.

262
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,797
Yeah, let me get
two decks, man,

263
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,066
and a white tee,
double-X.

264
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,629
And give me the rest
of them paint cans, too, man.

265
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,699
All right, all right,
there you go. That's it?

266
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,870
Yeah, what's that?

267
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,244
How much the man owe,
Sherrod?

268
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,048
- 13.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

269
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,716
He asked for all the cans.

270
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,885
Three cans is $12,
plus the other stuff.

271
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,725
It's $19.
$19, sir.

272
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,889
Come on, you still gettin'
off with a deal,

273
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,558
Now, you didn't have
to move your feet.

274
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,725
We came to you, right?

275
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,930
My bad.
$19, like he said.

276
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,230
Thank you very much.

277
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,638
He's an intern,
I'm working with him.

278
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,076
But, ma'am,
what I'm asking is

279
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,410
when was the last time
you saw Lex?

280
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,417
Oh, excuse me-- Curtis?

281
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,884
Hmm?

282
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,252
- Two days ago?
- I don't know where he at.

283
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,848
Three days?

284
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,851
You mind
if I look around?

285
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,863
I'd rather you
leave my house be.

286
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,730
Well, Ms. Anderson...

287
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,969
your son is in trouble,

288
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,371
and I can tell
you're upset.

289
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,034
But the best thing
that you can do for him--

290
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,873
the best thing that
he can do for himself--

291
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,709
is talk to me.

292
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,045
I'm gonna
tell you the truth:

293
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,880
We know
he's selling drugs.

294
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,317
And I'm gonna tell you...

295
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,877
I don't know
nothin' about that.

296
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,549
But I'm telling you
that I don't care

297
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,558
he's selling drugs.

298
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,425
I'm not even gonna
bother with that.

299
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm here
because of a homicide,

300
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,166
and the way
it looks right now

301
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,899
your boy is running
from the police

302
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,169
behind that killing.

303
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,869
I don't know
where he at...

304
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,900
Ma'am...

305
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:10,528
Councilman,
my people got only

306
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,895
cost-of-living bumps
for four years.

307
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,198
Morale is at rock bottom.

308
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,534
All things being equal,
you'd be our guy.

309
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,038
We like what we hear.

310
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,871
The polls say
it's going to be Royce.

311
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,706
We endorse you now,
we're out in the cold.

312
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,372
Bobby... this might be
the chance to get in on

313
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,382
the ground floor
of something better.

314
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,884
That may be true, Major.
But for now,

315
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,546
we're gonna play the cards
that we were dealt.

316
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,885
Councilman,
if you were me, I'm sure--

317
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,550
I'd cover my ass
and endorse Royce,

318
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,889
along with the teachers
and the firefighters.

319
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,053
But I'd also
tell my membership

320
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,562
not to get carried away.
I mean,

321
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,223
it's one thing
for the police union

322
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,892
to call out for Royce,

323
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,730
it's another thing entirely
for off-duty cops

324
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,566
to be manning
the mayor's phone banks

325
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,071
and polling stations.

326
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,869
I don't think
any of my officers

327
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,240
will be too aggressive
for anybody.

328
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,609
That much I can give you.

329
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,844
Best you could do,
Tommy.

330
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,546
Royce has got all those
fucks runnin' scared.

331
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,353
Yeah...

332
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,256
best I could do.

333
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,521
Call it a night, Tommy.

334
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,688
You got a debate
to prepare for tomorrow.

335
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,698
Yeah. Debate.

336
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,529
Nothing matters more
at this point.

337
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,195
Let the truth
set you free, Norman.

338
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,568
Nothing matters at all.

339
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,007
Thanks.

340
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,392
Come on, boy,
come on now.

341
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,223
Man, you better not
be getting tired,

342
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,388
'cause you gonna
get put to the test

343
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,625
- on Saturday night.
- I'm ready.

344
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,066
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey, Justin. Hello, Dennis.

345
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,228
You're Spider's mother, right?

346
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,101
Right, Sharon.
Sharon Johnson.

347
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,663
Your boy left here
a while ago.

348
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,696
I ain't looking for him.

349
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,333
He at his grandmother's.

350
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,106
I wanted to ask you something.

351
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,479
You know, my son
is crazy about you.

352
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,178
All he talks about is boxing,
bein' at the gym,

353
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,810
and what his coach
been teachin' him.

354
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,252
Well, Spider's a good kid.

355
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,949
He really studies
the sport.

356
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,514
Dennis,
I am so grateful

357
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,185
for your interest in Spider,

358
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,523
I want to cook you dinner.

359
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,687
How 'bout tonight?

360
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,028
Well, ah, that is
really nice, Sharon.

361
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,398
But the thing is, I got four of my boys
fighting this weekend,

362
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,027
and I got to train 'em
really hard

363
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,401
these next few evenings.

364
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,201
You in here every night
of the week.

365
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,367
What you do for fun?

366
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,570
Look here,
you got to eat, right?

367
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,875
And you can look
at me and know

368
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,541
I throw down
in the kitchen--

369
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,573
among other places.

370
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,386
Yeah, I tell you what:

371
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,513
If you fix me up a plate
and bring it over here,

372
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,545
I would love that.

373
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,251
That I can do.

374
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:02,696
- He said what?
- "Me? I'm just the police."

375
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,534
Like butter wouldn't
melt in his mouth.

376
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,403
And the thing
that I resent most

377
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,237
is that he's not
just playing the system,

378
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,038
he's playing me.

379
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,773
Like I'm part
of the problem.

380
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,144
You were gonna
hold back the paper

381
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,911
for Davis
and Krawczyk, right?

382
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,749
Only until
the primary was over.

383
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,449
And now you feel
guilty about it.

384
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,761
Did he do that thing
where he, uh,

385
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,263
stares at you over the top
of his reading glasses?

386
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,263
You know,
that look that says,

387
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,599
"I'm the father
you never had,

388
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,629
and I don't want to be disappointed
in you ever again."

389
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,603
It's not funny, Cedric!

390
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,614
Those subpoenas
went out today!

391
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,276
The front office is
gonna go batshit!

392
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,649
But you did it anyway.

393
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,620
I'm sorry, but shit,
I'm just glad to see

394
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,991
Lester doing it
to somebody other than me.

395
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,241
Hey, you holdin'
us back, Sherrod.

396
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,941
I made a mistake, man.
Why you trippin'?

397
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,842
If I can cut you loose
to handle the money,

398
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,079
we can cover
twice the ground,

399
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,213
selling twice
the merchandise.

400
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,722
More-- more--
what you call it,

401
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,123
uh, market share.

402
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,559
Instead I gotta
keep your ass close.

403
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,825
You shoulda been promoted
to your own cart by now.

404
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,264
You keep on hittin' your dome
on the glass ceiling.

405
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,030
- Glass what?
- You gotta step up the math skills

406
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,435
if you wanna advance
in this here enterprise.

407
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,938
You remember
last spring when

408
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,440
you tried to take me
up to Harlem Park?

409
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,771
They couldn't even find
my records, Bubs.

410
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,436
They didn't want
shit to do with me.

411
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,104
They put you
in a classroom, right?

412
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,943
The teacher didn't
look at me once.

413
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,107
So you rolled out.

414
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,776
An' who got hurt
behind that, huh?

415
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,785
The teacher or you?

416
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,482
What's four times five
plus six times seven?

417
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,085
See? See?

418
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,298
Fuck that shit, son.
I can't wait until school starts.

419
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,169
- You joking, right?
- Nah, seriously, son.

420
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,901
I can't wait to see
all them girls,

421
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,738
see which ones got phat
over the summer,

422
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,744
- you know?
- Guess who I saw last week?

423
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,746
- Who?
- Kwaneese Davis.

424
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,907
Oh, shit, you mean
Cute-Ass Kwaneese?

425
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,247
- Uh-huh.
- She phat?

426
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,651
Got titties, too.

427
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,746
I'm definitely tappin' that pussy,
now, y'all watch.

428
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,347
I'm be all up
in Kwaneese this year

429
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,052
Iike this, bangin' that...

430
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,084
Just like you tried to do
last year, right?

431
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,596
Fuck you, nigga,
I only halfway tried.

432
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,928
So, Michael, who you
gettin' with this year?

433
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,831
Stankin' ass, uh-- what's her name?
What's her name?

434
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,062
- What's her name?
- Oh, Tina.

435
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,400
Tina-- Tina Jenkins.

436
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,098
Don't talk bad
about Tina, man.

437
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,436
I'm not sayin'
that it bad.

438
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,271
I'm sayin' she be
sucking dudes' dicks

439
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,606
in the boys'
bathroom and shit,

440
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,508
- that's all.
- I heard you, man.

441
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,912
She suck dick even better
than you do, Namond.

442
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,383
- Oh!
- Wow.

443
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,885
What up?
What up, see?

444
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,352
Good jabbin', man.

445
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,884
Chill chill chill!
Don't rip this shit.

446
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,722
I just bought
this throwback.

447
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,729
Yo, Michael, son,
if I ain't had this shit on,

448
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,732
I'd have fucked you up.
Word up.

449
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,893
You little niggas ain't up
to no good, is you?

450
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,561
Yo, what up, Monk?

451
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,231
Look here, first day
of school coming up, right?

452
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,902
- Yeah, next week.
- Y'all need school clothes and shit?

453
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,967
Here...

454
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,576
Yo, what's this for?

455
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,741
What, you ain't hear me?
For new clothes,

456
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,251
whatever else
you need to get.

457
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,913
- Thanks, man!
- Damn, 200?

458
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,082
- Yo, thanks, Monk.
- Oh, you need to thank my man Marlo.

459
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,591
He ain't wanna see you
little motherfuckers

460
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,753
going raggedy
on the first day.

461
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,423
Whoa. That Marlo?

462
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,297
- Naw, man, no thanks.
- You ain't gotta do nothing for it.

463
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,324
No thank you, man.

464
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,529
Hey, yo, Mr. Monk?

465
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,336
I'll take his
if he don't want it.

466
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,037
- I'll hold his for you--
- Yo, don't press, man.

467
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,738
Don't press.

468
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,550
Fuck is wrong
with you, boy?

469
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,644
You too good
for my money?

470
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,883
Or is you such
a bitch-ass punk

471
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,153
you worried about where
my money come from?

472
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,728
Yeah.

473
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,403
Ain't no thing, shorty.

474
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,931
We cool.

475
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,416
You can't tell nobody.

476
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,426
Swear to me you won't
spread this around.

477
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,927
And he saw you?

478
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,260
Yeah, he saw me.

479
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,892
Carv, I'm fucked in the ass
with a pineapple on this.

480
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,369
- What the helI'd you say to him?
- I said, "Mr. Mayor,

481
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,703
that's a good,
strong dick you got there,

482
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,867
and I see you know
how to use it."

483
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,206
I didn't say shit!

484
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,212
And I didn't wait for him
to say anything, either.

485
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,043
Shit, I'm never gonna
make rank now.

486
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,380
I'll end up riding the boat
or some shit like McNulty.

487
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,385
This is way beyond
my pay grade.

488
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,724
We need to get with someone
who knows politics.

489
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,559
Who do we know
like that?

490
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,731
On crime,
he knows you're coming,

491
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,065
so he's gonna
set some traps

492
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,503
and lean on stats
that say crime is down.

493
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,166
He'll also try
to inoculate himself

494
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,731
by making it about you.

495
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,833
Like you're playing
the race card

496
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,969
if you talk about drugs
or violent crime.

497
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,411
He's hoping
you'll back down.

498
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,107
But you come on
twice as hard:

499
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,742
"Clarence Royce has not
made this city safe."

500
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,684
Hey, Jen, what's up?

501
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,352
- You got a second?
- No, I got time, what is it?

502
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,986
- You forgot the check.
- Oh no, you're kidding me.

503
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,519
You've got to
pay it right away.

504
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,464
No, no, I got
the number here, yeah.

505
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,364
No, I'll straighten
it out straightaway.

506
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,028
- Okay.
- Yeah.

507
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,866
Shit.

508
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,201
I forgot to mail the check

509
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,208
to the fuckin' archdiocese.

510
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,869
My kid's gonna get tossed
outta St. Albans

511
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,377
if I don't get
my shit together.

512
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,903
Tommy. Focus.

513
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,445
He comes at me with race
and some bullshit crime stats.

514
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,214
I ignore the race thing
and counter by noting

515
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,154
that homicides are up
15% even though

516
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,680
other violent crime stats
are down 12%.

517
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,317
I point out
this does not make sense

518
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,918
unless Royce is cooking
the crime stats,

519
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,590
making robberies, rapes,
and assaults disappear.

520
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,725
I suggest the mayor is not telling
the truth about crime in the city.

521
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,099
I conclude by declaring that
it is for all of Baltimore--

522
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,125
every neighborhood--

523
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,570
that I'm making public safety

524
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,938
the cornerstone
of my campaign.

525
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,401
Tomorrow night,
I will kick his ass.

526
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,914
But the next morning,

527
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,281
I still wake up white
in a city that ain't.

528
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,849
Sister Theresa?

529
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,518
Hey, how you doing?

530
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,187
Yeah, Tommy Carcetti.

531
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,856
Yo, Randy, man,
you crack me up, son.

532
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,524
Running behind him
talking about,

533
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,693
"I'll take his, Mr. Monk.
Give his to me."

534
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,430
Listen, man,
I could've used that extra.

535
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,698
I already spent
all the clothes money

536
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,172
Miss Anna gave me on stuff
to sell at school.

537
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,198
Yo, and plus Marlo
wanted us to have it.

538
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,368
He want to show us

539
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,378
who callin'
the shots out here.

540
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,880
- Yo, Michael, why you ain't take it?
- that ain't me, man.

541
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,212
- Say what?
- That owin' niggas for shit, man.

542
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,548
- That ain't me.
- I'll take any motherfuckin' money

543
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,384
- if he givin' it away now.
- Why?

544
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,549
Shit, your family got
more money than all of us.

545
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,218
Yeah, but my mom said
she cuttin' me off,

546
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,227
she ain't buyin' me school
clothes and shit.

547
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,229
You already took my job
with Bodie, so...

548
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,227
- Gentlemen.
- Oh my God.

549
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,531
Oh shit!

550
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:58,736
- Donut, you crazy, man.
- Yo, Donut.

551
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,745
You think you could steal us
one of them camper trucks?

552
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,838
Yo, you steal us a camper truck,
we can all go campin'

553
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,008
- out in the woods an' all.
- I be scared in the woods.

554
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,541
I don't mean far like that.
I mean like Howard County.

555
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:08,779
Naw naw naw, man.

556
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,549
The Ku Klux Klan
live in Howard County.

557
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,748
I know that for a fact.

558
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,485
Nigga, my aunt live
in Howard County.

559
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,686
There ain't no
Ku Klux Klan there.

560
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,388
Nigga, you simple,
I swear.

561
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,691
Hey, yo, Donut,
drive me away

562
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,527
from these
ignorant bitches, man.

563
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,862
You can't tell
these niggas nothin'.

564
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,390
Move, motherfucker.

565
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,201
Can you see
over the steering wheel?

566
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,437
You think
he'll talk to me?

567
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,706
Use my name
if you have to.

568
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,408
I had one of his sectors
for eight months.

569
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,583
What's wrong
with that picture?

570
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,058
Nigga, if there was a
black one in the parking lot,

571
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,527
I would've took one.

572
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,089
Yo-- narcos,
narcos!

573
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,069
760 to K-G-A.

574
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,731
I got a bailout
at Calhoun and Mosher,

575
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,501
six to eight juveniles
beating feet north

576
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,508
in the alleys
around Calhoun.

577
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,010
10-4. K-G-A to all units--

578
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,036
I love this.
Just like old times.

579
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,686
I don't need to chase
these fucking knuckleheads.

580
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,847
I know half of 'em.

581
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,823
Shit, I know
where they hang.

582
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,019
Besides,
you're a little overdressed.

583
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,224
Let's just call this in and go see
the man about your thing.

584
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,744
Yo, yo, man,
I ain't do nothin'!

585
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,383
- I ain't do nothin'!
- Then why you runnin'?

586
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,892
- 'Cause you chasin' me.
- Yeah, right. What's your name?

587
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,725
- For real, man, I ain't do nothin'.
- What's your goddamn name?

588
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,128
- Randy.
- Randy what?

589
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,565
- Wagstaff.
- I know you ain't lying.

590
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,726
Wouldn't nobody
make that shit up.

591
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,894
Put your hands against
this fucking wall.

592
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,233
Come on--
what do you know

593
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,966
about hoppers bailing
from a stolen car?

594
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,769
Nothin'.

595
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,744
Little motherfucker.
You slingin'.

596
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,746
- No, sir. I swear to God.
- Hell you ain't.

597
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,645
How else you walking around
with 200 in your pocket?

598
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,650
My foster mother gave me that
to buy school clothes with.

599
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,244
Your foster mother
gave you 200 cash?

600
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,414
Yeah.

601
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,922
Tell her to come down
to the Western,

602
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,686
and I'll give it back to her.

603
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:31,058
Beat feet, motherfucker,
before I lock your little ass up.

604
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,795
Don't be fucking
lookin' at me, move.

605
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,637
This right here is fire.

606
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,605
That said, I'm ready
to serve 'em myself

607
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,114
and keep your names off
the returns.

608
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,946
I've got my 20.

609
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,214
You two got to live
in this department.

610
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,317
Fuck 'em
where they live.

611
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,424
Let's go.

612
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,196
The price of steel
being what it is,

613
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,229
that's gonna kill us
if we can't

614
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,071
pass along the overage.

615
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,737
Mr. Krawczyk?
Baltimore City Police.

616
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,110
- What's this?
- A subpoena for records.

617
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,413
You need these right now,
because, uh,

618
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,419
I'm kinda up to my ass
in stuff today.

619
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,011
Honor it in a timely fashion.

620
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,919
I think that's
the legal standard.

621
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,915
- No problem, Detective--
- Shakima Greggs.

622
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,258
You're with the city?

623
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,459
- Which unit?
- Major Crimes.

624
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,997
Senator.

625
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,443
What the hell is this?

626
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,948
Subpoena for records.

627
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,644
Sphinx Club?

628
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,711
- Man of the year.
- What kinda bullshit is this?

629
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,655
You people must be out
your damn mind.

630
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,385
You were in
the Sphinx Club?

631
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,983
My uncle used
to tend bar over there.

632
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,892
Marvin Thompson?
Short guy--

633
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,557
What is your name,
Officer?

634
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,589
Detective Sydnor, sir.

635
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,794
"Major Crimes"?

636
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,807
Shit...

637
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,604
Enjoy your day, sir.

638
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,940
Son, we're gonna see
about this.

639
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,581
That's it.

640
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,620
Yankin' that bitch.

641
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,527
Son, that's too much knuckle.

642
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,040
Why the fuck
you keep callin' me?

643
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,206
But what I say, though?

644
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,874
He got
the message, fool.

645
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,213
Yo, Monk.
Who that, man?

646
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,878
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

647
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,548
Here, let me
holla at that dude.

648
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,056
Yo, check this out, man.

649
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,718
I'm gonna show you
how you do this

650
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,386
right here, man.

651
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,395
Don't rush me on shit.

652
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,091
I'll get at you
when I'm at you.

653
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,730
Yo, remember who
you're talking to

654
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,933
before you say
another fuckin' word.

655
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,748
Andre, man.

656
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:39,909
Nigga need
more maintenance

657
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,714
than both
my babies' mamas.

658
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,417
By accident.
It was accidental.

659
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,059
And the mayor
doesn't say anything?

660
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,190
I think
he's pretty mad.

661
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,599
I mean, Major,
I only took this detail

662
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,603
to try and make sergeant
on this list.

663
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,663
Kid, you made
sergeant already.

664
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,175
Shit, if Royce
gets reelected,

665
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,440
you'll be a lieutenant in two years
and a major in four.

666
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,049
You go back down
to the hall.

667
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,211
You act like
it never happened.

668
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,880
You shut up.

669
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,889
Say nothing to no one.

670
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,220
But the mayor,
he's gonna--

671
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,887
He's gonna watch
and see how you carry it.

672
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,556
And kid,
you're a fucking rock.

673
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,395
When the mayor
looks in your face,

674
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:33,200
he knows he can
trust you with this.

675
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,172
And I'll bet
in a couple of weeks,

676
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,573
he comes asking,
real friendly-like,

677
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,543
what are you looking
to do with the department?

678
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,546
With your career?

679
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,946
He's interested in you.

680
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,143
But he doesn't mention
no blowjob,

681
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,618
and neither do you.

682
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,484
Uh-uh, it just lays there

683
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,388
Iike a bad pierogi
on the plate,

684
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:57,383
both of you pretending
it ain't there.

685
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,293
What if he
screws me over?

686
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,355
Bounces me
to a midnight shift?

687
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,527
He does that,
you will talk.

688
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:15,368
What I wouldn't give to be
in your shoes right now.

689
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,540
Kid, careers have
been launched

690
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,880
on a hell
of a lot less.

691
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,910
Just shut up
and play dumb.

692
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:29,556
I can do that.
No problem.

693
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,221
Thanks, Major.

694
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,890
Thanks for taking the time
to meet me on this.

695
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,900
I mean, it's a weight off
my mind talking to you.

696
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,231
It really is.

697
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,237
Don't mention it.

698
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,398
Maybe you get a chance
to do me a turn

699
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,273
one day after
you make rank, huh?

700
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,270
Oh, boy.

701
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,109
It's all good, Carv.

702
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,418
Because if some
federal motherfucker comes

703
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,121
through the door,
I say, "Hey,

704
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,857
it's all in the game."

705
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,558
But a City Police?

706
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,032
Baltimore City?
Hell, no.

707
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,694
Can't be happenin',
'cause I know

708
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,966
I have raised too much
goddamn money

709
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,700
for the mayor
and his ticket.

710
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,866
Hell, no!

711
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,205
Ain't no soul
in the world

712
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,073
that fuckin' ungrateful!

713
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,104
- Calm down, Clay, hmm?
- Money laundering?

714
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,706
They gonna
come talk to me

715
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,047
about money laundering?

716
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,551
In West Baltimore?

717
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,884
Shit... Where do y'all
think I'm gonna

718
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,220
raise cash for
the whole damn ticket?

719
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,316
From laundromats
and shit?

720
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,886
From some tiny-ass
Korean groceries?

721
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,898
You think I have time
to ask a man

722
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,900
why he givin' me money?

723
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,731
Or where he gets
his money from?

724
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,363
I'll take any motherfucker's money
if he givin' it away.

725
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,839
- I don't wanna know.
- I know you don't wanna know.

726
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,273
But I'm scratchin'
an' clawin'

727
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,209
to get it done for you,
Clarence.

728
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,769
For you and me
and the rest of the team.

729
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,178
And who comes
through my door

730
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,910
but a Baltimore City Police

731
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,713
Iookin' to get up
into my shit about it.

732
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,013
Clay, we didn't know
about that.

733
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,748
I'm sorry, I gots
to leave up out of here

734
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,722
before I lose
my damn mind.

735
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,155
Nobody knew about that.

736
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,385
You want
to run a campaign

737
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,223
with my money
pillowed under your ass,

738
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,890
you need your people
to back the fuck up, Clarence.

739
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,370
Krawczyk's on line one.

740
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,464
I'll jump on Burrell
and Demper both.

741
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,769
Find out
what the hell's going on.

742
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,403
Wait-- wait a minute.

743
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,642
That new driver,
the bald-headed, white kid.

744
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,808
Where did he
come here from?

745
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,545
Hoskins brought
him in, I think.

746
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,452
Hoskins?
He doesn't have a better rabbi

747
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,853
in the department than that?

748
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,880
Why, you want
to lose him?

749
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,722
Let me think about it.

750
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,470
Yeah, man, Officer Walker
be shady like that.

751
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,306
Police be stealin', yo.

752
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,108
Yo, what I really wanna
get is a bubble Caprice.

753
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,944
I seen
a nice one, too.

754
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,440
'94 caprice on 22's.
Shit was tight.

755
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,750
You better be careful.
They almost caught you today.

756
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,346
Nigga, they ain't
almost caught shit.

757
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,982
Shh. Be quiet, y'all.

758
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,356
Y'all know
who I am, right?

759
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,793
Carver.
You a narcos.

760
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,059
Today I'm auto theft.

761
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,089
Fair warning.

762
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,465
If I see any of
y'all little hoppers

763
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,970
even smile
at a motor vehicle again,

764
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,201
it ain't gonna be no juvenile hearing.
No, it's gonna be my people

765
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,471
settlin' up with y'all in the alleys.
You understand?

766
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,876
- You can't do that, yo.
- Try me, Namond.

767
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,039
Yeah, that's right.
I know your name,

768
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,776
I know where you live

769
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,807
and I know where
y'all hang.

770
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,930
Damn, yo!
Nice ride.

771
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,163
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hmm?

772
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,108
You have any luck
finding your shooter?

773
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,338
Naw. He's runnin'.

774
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,847
But at least I know who
my shooter is, right?

775
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,508
I just got
to find the boy.

776
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,677
- Family won't go for nothin'?
- Nah.

777
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,983
Mother wouldn't say shit.

778
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,682
But it wasn't the usual way
a mama lies.

779
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,590
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

780
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,354
It was a weird vibe, man.

781
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,691
I can't explain it.

782
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,527
It was like she was off
somewhere else in her head.

783
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,062
Line four.
Communication.

784
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,628
- Who's up?
- I'm up. I'll take it.

785
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,230
No, wait.

786
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,366
If it's yours,
you lucky bitch,

787
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,378
then it's a domestic
in a house with four wits.

788
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,380
- You want the call?
- But I pick up that phone,

789
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,972
do I make it unlucky?

790
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,277
Or is it still your call?

791
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,047
You want the call,
pick it up.

792
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,577
If you don't, don't.

793
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,389
Homicide. Norris.

794
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:59,260
Right. Uh-huh. I got it.

795
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,390
1400 Lanvale, in the street,
found by the post officer,

796
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,404
no suspects,
no witnesses.

797
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,436
Ah, man.

798
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,673
Better to be lucky
than to be good.

799
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,077
You wanna work
the heavy bag?

800
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,283
G'head. Four rounds.

801
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,594
Hey.

802
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,107
- Hey.
- I'm Gail.

803
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,006
I made this for you
and the other men

804
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,671
to let you know
you're appreciated.

805
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,613
- That's real nice.
- Peach cobbler.

806
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,776
I'm sorry, I forgot
whose mother you are.

807
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,012
Oh, I don't have
any boys.

808
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,815
I just appreciate
what you been doing,

809
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,049
you and the other coaches
volunteering and all.

810
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,989
Well, thank you,
that's real nice.

811
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,858
I got three girls. Y'all don't
teach girls, though, do you?

812
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:07,728
- No, I'm real old-fashioned about that.
- Oh, I agree wit' you.

813
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,393
Men should be men
and women should be women.

814
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,265
That's what I think.

815
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,403
Single wound,
upper back, no casings,

816
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,071
no witnesses, and nothing
on the canvas.

817
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,740
- Dead when you got here?
- Actually not.

818
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,250
He was still conscious
and coughin' blood when I pulled up.

819
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,479
- You ask who shot him?
- Yeah, I asked who shot him.

820
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,920
He said it was
a guy with a gun.

821
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:41,255
Yo, why the fuck
you keep calling me?

822
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,959
He got the message, fool.

823
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,228
Yo, Monk,
who that, man?

824
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,600
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

825
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,772
Yo, Monk,
who that, man?

826
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,571
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

827
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,545
Lemme key that.

828
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,944
Yo, Monk.
Who that, man?

829
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,142
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

830
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,983
Yo, check this out, man.

831
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,218
Don't rush me on shit.

832
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,592
- I'll get at you when I'm at you.
- I'm just saying...

833
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,060
Old Face Andre.

834
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,567
Tryin' to reup
with Monk Metcalf.

835
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,899
Yeah, well, Monk took the call
on his cell phone.

836
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,564
But that second voice
ranked him.

837
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,038
Ranked everybody,
by the sound of it.

838
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,564
Marlo Stanfield.
On the phone.

839
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,635
The way he shut that call down,
I'd say, yeah, that was him.

840
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah, but what was all that
in the background? Fireworks, or--

841
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,873
Naw, it was regular intervals.
Semi-auto from the sound.

842
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,579
Target practice, maybe.

843
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,917
Either that
or a firing squad.

844
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:41,686
There are no bodies
on this guy in months,

845
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,090
but we get him
on the phone

846
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,754
and it sounds
like a war zone.

847
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,093
Well, at least he gets
on a phone now and then.

848
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,929
- That's something.
- Sounds arrogant, doesn't he?

849
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,265
Like he's the lil' king
of everything.

850
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,134
Ah. Youth.

851
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,751
Yo, bubs.

852
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,726
Thought you asleep.

853
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,558
If you want...

854
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,929
I could go
to school some.

855
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,735
I ain't been
for a while,

856
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:29,569
so I don't even
know if I can.

857
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,542
But if you
want me to go...

858
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,567
ain't no thing.

859
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,556
His Honor was mad?

860
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,790
I can't begin
to describe it.

861
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,663
- What's he want from us?
- To block the subpoenas,

862
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,396
but he knows we can't
once those things go out.

863
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,734
What I could promise him

864
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,003
is no more surprises
out of our shop.

865
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,101
Is this that
cocksucker McNulty?

866
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,739
Not this time. He's been gone
from that unit a year.

867
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,239
My best guess would be
Lester Freamon.

868
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,775
- Freamon?
- Lester's got a helluva game.

869
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,685
Well, we need to sit
on the motherfucker.

870
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,746
All that unit needs,
Commissioner,

871
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,917
is proper supervision.

872
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,891
Hey, the State of Maryland

873
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,658
just lost another
cooperating witness,

874
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,064
and I just found a lot
of fucking overtime.

875
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,364
This case went from
a who-gives-a-fuck drug murder

876
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,393
to straight-up red ball.

877
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,400
Fuck, I should've
picked up that phone.

878
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,045
Hey, Sarge.
My boy's a witness.

879
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,983
Drug case pending
in part 18.

880
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,213
You know for sure
he's killed for that reason?

881
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,312
Don't know shit. But from the look
of the court computer,

882
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,255
this guy's
the state's whole case.

883
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,885
Don't put it in the 24 that
the guy was a witness.

884
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,054
Trust me,
we do not wanna kick shit

885
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,724
in an election year.
Work the case, take the O.T.,

886
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,098
but bury the witness angle
till we know for sure.

887
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,761
And close the door.

888
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,087
Yeah.

889
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,749
It's Landsman. Homicide.

890
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,315
Is the major
in this morning?

891
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,122
Next order of business:
class rules.

892
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,152
It helps if the team
is constant on these.

893
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,187
Less wiggle room
for the children.

894
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,358
Mrs. Scott?

895
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,390
Same as last year,
double space.

896
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,232
Language Arts,
we grade a lot of papers.

897
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,862
It doesn't make them
write any better,

898
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,805
but it saves my eyesight.

899
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,138
Make sure you
demonstrate it for them.

900
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,371
Some of them think double-space
means more space between words.

901
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,038
I'd of thought
by eighth grade--

902
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,072
Rule of thumb around here,
Mr. Pryzbylewski: Never assume.

903
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,549
Explain what
you want them to do,

904
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,677
have them do it,
then explain again.

905
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,052
With time and patience,
they'll get it.

906
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:35,024
- Mrs. Shapiro?
- It's easier to keep track of lab work

907
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,992
if we all use
the same heading.

908
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,860
Upper right-hand corner,
above the first blue line:

909
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,389
name, date, and class number,
in that order?

910
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,867
Mr. Pryzbylewski, do you have
anything you want addressed?

911
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,497
Can we have them
not chew gum?

912
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,564
They won't do it
in Ms. Sampson's class,

913
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,041
but in four years, I have not
been able to stop them.

914
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,874
You can try, but first year,
it's best to stick with basics.

915
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,278
And team rules--
we can only go

916
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,305
with what
we can all enforce.

917
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,909
Also, keep your
windows closed.

918
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,682
Makes them drowsy,
and drowsy's good.

919
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,155
There's a lot to learn.
But for now,

920
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,352
build in lots of activities
in your lesson plan.

921
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,519
You can't have enough.

922
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:13,394
You keep them busy,
you keep them off-guard.

923
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,827
You need soft eyes.

924
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,861
Excuse me?

925
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,208
Yeah, but that
doesn't prevent you

926
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,404
from giving more
under your wife's name,

927
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,140
your children, if they
got separate accounts...

928
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,807
yeah.

929
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,014
Sorry, Richie,
can you hold a moment?

930
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,884
Your buddy
from the F.O.P.

931
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,218
And he says
it's important.

932
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,315
Hey, Stan.

933
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,054
I'm a little busy
losing an election here.

934
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,153
You remember about
six months ago,

935
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,720
you told me
to keep an eye for

936
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,493
any witnesses
gettin' clipped?

937
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,524
You remember that?

938
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,594
Who's better than me,
Tommy?

939
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,076
Hey, Richie,
can I call you back?

940
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,839
Thanks.

941
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,011
Anything else you want me
to do, Miss Donnelly?

942
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,519
Uh...

943
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,647
you live near
Duquan Weems, correct?

944
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,520
Dukie?

945
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,719
I want you to take
this to his house.

946
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,227
These clothes won't
stay clean long.

947
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,560
Make sure you deliver
them just to Duquan,

948
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,030
not any of the adults
in the house.

949
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,192
- Just Duquan.
- Want me to do it tonight?

950
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,862
that would be great.
And, Crystal, thanks for today.

951
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,372
You're welcome,
Miss Donnelly.

952
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,533
- Can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am.

953
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,202
This young man has to be
registered for school.

954
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,041
- Does he attend here?
- He should.

955
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,946
What I mean is, what grade
were you in last year, dear?

956
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,045
He kinda lost his way
some time ago.

957
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,451
He's livin'
with me now.

958
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,546
And you are his...

959
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,580
Uncle.
I'm his uncle.

960
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,087
Come into my office.

961
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,592
Thank you.
Excuse me.

962
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,017
Yo, look at coach
workin' it, yo.

963
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,426
A'ight, man, break.
That's what I like to see, baby.

964
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,521
That's what I like to see.
You gotta use that left

965
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:31,022
- a little more, though, a'ight?
- Yo, man, you finished?

966
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,366
- Got another two minutes.
- Fuck that, I got a fight coming up.

967
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:34,700
You can come back
later, a'ight?

968
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,103
Yo, man said he got
one more round, a'ight?

969
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,367
Step aside, youngin'.

970
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,238
Naw, man, bag is mine
for four rounds

971
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,404
- and I only did three.
- Fuck that.

972
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,209
What the fuck you
tryin' to prove, huh?

973
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,215
Whoa, whoa. Come on, man,
come on. Come on.

974
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,376
- What's going on, boy?
- I got a fight Saturday night,

975
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,544
an' the boy won't
get off the bag.

976
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,110
What the fuck he on
the bag for anyway, huh?

977
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,145
He don't even fight.
He don't even spar.

978
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,452
Spar with
your ass any day.

979
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,220
- Come on, then.
- Hey hey hey.

980
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,487
Y'all be cool,
you hear me?

981
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,552
I ain't putting up
with this foolishness.

982
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,064
Come here, Michael.

983
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,932
- I can work the bag now, right?
- Not yet. Just wait.

984
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,630
- You said four rounds.
- Yeah, I know what I said.

985
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,572
You finish up your rounds,
and then Justin gets on.

986
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,507
I don't want hear
no more street talk.

987
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,737
We boxin' up in here,
we ain't fightin'.

988
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,245
He wanna get in
the ring with me,

989
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,747
- we can go.
- Look here, look here,

990
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,875
Iet me tell you something:
You can come here,

991
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,407
work out,
use the equipment.

992
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,749
But nobody
gets in that ring

993
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,584
unless they're being trained.

994
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,613
You wanna be trained?

995
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,521
I've been watching you
hit that bag.

996
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,255
You got
a natural right hand,

997
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,593
the way you throw it,
the way you land it.

998
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:35,928
Now if I was
to train you,

999
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,365
we'd have to start
with floor work.

1000
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,266
'Cause see, if you don't
know how to move,

1001
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,066
you ain't got no business
being in that ring.

1002
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,766
So what you think?

1003
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,640
I'd train you myself,
personally.

1004
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,947
Nah, really I just wanna keep

1005
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,448
doing what I been doing.

1006
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,813
All right.

1007
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,718
Let's see that right.

1008
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:02,747
Uh-huh.

1009
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,538
Is Dukie here?

1010
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,305
What's that?
That's for Duquan, right?

1011
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:24,074
I take it to him.

1012
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,581
Gimme.

1013
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,742
Hey, Crystal.

1014
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,752
Miss Donnelly said
to give you these.

1015
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,617
Okay.
I'll be right down.

1016
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,281
What?

1017
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,556
And for either of
my opponents to suggest

1018
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,859
that downtown development
comes at the expense

1019
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,024
of our city's neighborhoods,

1020
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:47,400
well, that's just unfair
and, uh, divisive.

1021
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,600
For them to suggest
that my administration

1022
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,666
has not been
responsive, well...

1023
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,042
Economic development
cannot be a band-aid.

1024
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,776
It is a long-term process
that requires commitment

1025
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,785
to retraining our workforce
and, as I said before,

1026
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,218
this can only be successful

1027
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,812
in a city where
people feel safe.

1028
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,721
So before we can
even begin to think about

1029
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,247
Iuring new industries to Baltimore,

1030
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,953
we need to think about
how we can make

1031
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,293
these neighborhoods
and this city safe once again.

1032
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,891
Mr. Carcetti may think
it's in his interest

1033
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,400
to exploit people's fears.

1034
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:22,235
He's been doing it
throughout this campaign.

1035
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,739
I'm offended by it,
personally.

1036
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,468
But the fact is,

1037
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,945
that violent crime
is down citywide,

1038
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,812
and our police department
is working hard

1039
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,076
to keep it that way--

1040
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:36,085
and will continue to do so
under my administration.

1041
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,245
Councilman Carcetti,

1042
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,755
you have two minutes
to respond.

1043
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,086
Does anyone in this room
really believe

1044
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,921
that crime is down
in Baltimore?

1045
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,586
You calling me a liar,
Tommy?

1046
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,823
Gentleman, please.
No personal interactions.

1047
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,661
- Councilman Carcetti.
- Can the mayor honestly tell

1048
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,133
the people of Rosemont,
of Belair Edison,

1049
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,602
of Highlandtown
or Cherry Hill

1050
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,606
there's less drug-dealing,
less violence?

1051
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,904
Any statistics coming
from the police department

1052
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,773
cannot be trusted,
because under this mayor,

1053
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,539
the police are more concerned

1054
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,742
with protecting Clarence Royce
politically than fighting crime.

1055
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:08,717
There's no leadership
and morale has never been lower.

1056
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,083
I'll change that.

1057
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,384
It's business as usual
down at City Hall

1058
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,890
and as a result,
our response to crime

1059
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,223
has been characterized
time and time again

1060
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,888
by wanton indifference.

1061
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,420
...32 yards!

1062
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,729
What do I mean
by business as usual?

1063
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,963
What do I mean
by wanton indifference?

1064
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,563
Well, last night
in West Baltimore,

1065
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,403
on Lanvale Street,

1066
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:34,035
another citizen
was shot and killed.

1067
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,874
This time, the victim
was a key witness

1068
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,812
in a drug case that
had yet to come to court.

1069
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,816
Courageously, this man
had agreed to testify

1070
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,784
in two weeks time
in that case.

1071
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,844
The police should have
been protecting him.

1072
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,914
They were not,
and he was murdered.

1073
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,085
- Oh, shit.
- Why? Because this mayor...

1074
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,423
You're prime-time, Eddie.

1075
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,793
...would not spend the money
to protect him.

1076
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,764
Now I have no doubt
that in a moment or two

1077
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,596
Clarence Royce will
accuse me of exploiting

1078
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,932
this man's death
for my own political purpose.

1079
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,029
But the truth is,

1080
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,973
a year ago I wrote
the mayor a letter.

1081
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,566
I have copies for anyone
who wants one.

1082
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,942
I begged him
to spend the money

1083
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,844
and make witness protection
a priority.

1084
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,347
He ignored me.

1085
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,247
I even teamed up
with our legislative leaders--

1086
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,751
Delegate Watkins
and others--

1087
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,719
to get matching funds
for witness protection

1088
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,914
approved in Annapolis.

1089
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,048
And incredibly
those matching funds

1090
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,922
were never claimed
by this administration.

1091
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,393
Now to mention this
now may be exploitive--

1092
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,919
I don't know.
I only know it's true,

1093
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,228
and on such truths
I ask the voters

1094
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,735
of our city
to consider a change.

1095
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,870
Folks, please, please,
hold your applause

1096
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,741
until after the round
of questions is over.

1097
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,802
Mayor Royce?

1098
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:46,077
No more surprises, huh?

1099
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,847
I am unaware of the specifics
of the incident

1100
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,116
to which Councilman Carcetti
is referring,

1101
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,454
uh, so I can't answer
that directly, um...

1102
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:58,950
however, I can say
that this city places

1103
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:02,795
the highest priority
on protecting those citizens

1104
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,390
who come forward to testify,

1105
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,335
and we will continue
to do so.

1106
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,329
Mr. Carcetti states
that he wrote a letter

1107
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,366
expressing his concerns,
and I'm sure that he did.

1108
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,844
I mean it's-- it's--

1109
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,369
it's easy enough
to write letters

1110
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,008
when all you have to do
is write letters.

1111
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,383
But when you
are required

1112
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,888
to run a city

1113
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,891
on limited resources,

1114
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,052
and balance priorities,

1115
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,892
well, then-- well,
then you understand

1116
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,899
that writing letters will
not solve the problem.

1117
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,560
Oh, no...

1118
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,401
Shit, girl.

1119
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,567
You know
I'm-a roll wit' you.

1120
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:49,738
Huh, I need
some kinda break.

1121
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,940
Mm-hmm.

1122
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,896
Oh, shit.

1123
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,543
Ain't nothin' worse
than them bitches

1124
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,710
with fucked-up nails
at the blackjack table.

1125
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,686
You know.

1126
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,154
Hold on.

1127
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,884
You think my son
gonna go up

1128
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:37,256
to that school lookin'
like himself?

1129
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,734
And I don't believe
we can get a handle on crime

1130
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,895
until we get a handle
on the schools.

1131
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,063
Because we need to be
thinking about these kids

1132
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,232
before the corners
take them.

1133
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:53,606
And this means a renewed focus
on our schools...
