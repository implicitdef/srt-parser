1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,199
But it's a snail,
you see,

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,803
and it go--
it go, "Meow."

3
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,645
It's a what, now?
What?

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,842
It meows.

5
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,748
Then it ooze all up
SpongeBob's belly

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,015
Iike it's his pet
and shit.

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:25,184
Yo, y'all niggers watch
too many cartoons, I swear.

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,954
Hey!

9
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,860
Look, see, this is what's wrong with
the justice system right here.

10
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,488
Niggers get locked up
and they don't stay that way.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,523
They make it hard to
take this shit serious.

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,194
What, you snitchin'
or something?

13
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,362
Shit no, man.

14
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,837
You know they only
gave me, like, four, right?

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,033
Know what I'm saying?
I done 15 months.

16
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,235
So with good time, I'm like,
"Man, what the fuck?"

17
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,368
Shit.

18
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,935
Yeah, man.

19
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,503
So...

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,142
Yeah, man,
it ain't like it was, but it'll do.

21
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:56,087
- So who we slinging for?
- Marlo Stanfield.

22
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,488
- Come on, man!
- Yo, man, yeah.

23
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,720
I was getting this nice
package from Slim Charles,

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,194
but Marlo got the muscle
to hold us down,

25
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,526
so that's where we at.

26
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,362
Shit, one boss
same as the next, man.

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,095
Make sure they ain't
sleepin', all right?

28
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,830
Hey, yo, Little Kev,

29
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,167
I told you about
the boy, Poot, right?

30
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,604
Yeah.
Pussy hound.

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,107
You just home?

32
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,075
- How long in?
- 15 months.

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,509
You got laid yet?

34
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,479
Shit, I think
I already been burnt.

35
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,538
Shit, I might need a ride
to the clinic today.

36
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,942
I see ain't shit changed
around this joint.

37
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,510
On the wall, gents.

38
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,185
Make this easy
on all of us.

39
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,057
Which one of youse
is Little Kevin?

40
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,686
Come on, fellas.
It ain't no big deal.

41
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,628
We just need some face time
with the motherfucker.

42
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,122
Your name Kevin?

43
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,156
No, this is, uh--

44
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,033
Poot.
I'm Poot, yo.

45
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,470
Poot, right, yeah. Didn't you
get locked up or shot or something?

46
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,406
Society say l
deserve another chance.

47
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,909
Yeah? Let's see. Which one of
these dickheads here is Little Kevin?

48
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,412
- Man, I don't know no Kevin.
- Society can bite my dick.

49
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,380
Come on, Bodie. I know this kid
works up here with you.

50
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,315
- What's your name?
- Do I look little to you?

51
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,410
All right. Fuck this. Everyone
under 150 lbs or 5'6" is in the cab.

52
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,819
You, you, and you.

53
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,721
And unless I see birth certificates
saying otherwise,

54
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,880
you're my Little Kevins.

55
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,190
And if that don't get it,
we're coming the fuck back.

56
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,199
That's fucked up, yo.

57
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,630
You got any
paper on you?

58
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,470
Man, fuck if I know.

59
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,410
These police out here knew how
to flip it even just a little,

60
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,413
my shit would
be in handcuffs.

61
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,414
You know?

62
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,006
They don't know shit.

63
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,381
Damn!

64
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,691
You my ride?

65
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,997
I'm your motherfucking
savior, is what I am.

66
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,735
Told y'all Andre
was lying on me, yo.

67
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,601
I didn't do it
for you.

68
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,539
Fact is...

69
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,008
if I could work back on
whatever cases I already caught,

70
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,034
you might be going
right back inside.

71
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,342
I know.

72
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,110
So who did kill
that delivery girl?

73
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,116
I don't know.

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,276
Know it wasn't Andre.

75
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,515
His blood don't run
that kind of cold.

76
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,579
Who he getting his
package from?

77
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,425
Saying I could go back
to the crib and bear up,

78
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,223
find some things out
for you if you want me to--

79
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,229
You owe me,
motherfucker.

80
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,730
I'm saying
I know I do, man.

81
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,824
And if you want to pay down
any part of this debt,

82
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,664
you know what you
gotta do for me?

83
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,693
No more bodies.

84
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,968
No more fucking
bodies from you.

85
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,240
No more comebacks
or get-evens on this.

86
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,610
No more killing.

87
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,252
You owe me your word.

88
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,482
All right, man.

89
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,083
No bodies on me.

90
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,790
You really want
to ease my mind,

91
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,597
you'll let me drive you
down to Aberdeen rail station,

92
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,160
put you on a
northbound train.

93
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,671
Naw, man.

94
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,606
Baltimore's all I know.

95
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,268
You know what
it is like, homey.

96
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,976
Man gotta live what
he know, right?

97
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,210
You're absolutely right.

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,241
There are many significant
factors to consider,

99
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,548
but getting
crime under control

100
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,578
is key to sparking
investment here,

101
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,557
- jump-starting growth.
- If you make it safe, they will come.

102
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,152
Well, I hate to begin our beautiful
relationship with my hand out,

103
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,596
but I'm told that two federal grants
to my office dry up this year.

104
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,496
That's right.
Come the first of the year,

105
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,093
those DOJ grants evaporate,
and you're out 1 2 prosecutors.

106
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,535
Well, I was hoping you'd
be able to absorb that

107
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,560
in the general fund,

108
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,402
maybe even throw in
a little bit more,

109
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,931
make it competitive with the PD
and Attorney General's jobs--

110
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,444
starts the turnover.
It's killing us.

111
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,811
This would be the time to do it.
I mean, we're over the revenue

112
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,907
expected for this point
in the fiscal year

113
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,417
next to the
real estate market.

114
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,316
How much past? 'Cause l
want to come out of the box

115
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,615
with a big bump
in police salaries,

116
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,246
in particular the
commissioner's salary,

117
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,881
which needs to jump,
like, 50 grand.

118
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,291
Well, a good guess would be a
one-shot surplus of about 20 million.

119
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,558
But that's rainy-day money
for more than crime.

120
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,895
Word around North Avenue is that
the schools are running a deficit.

121
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,060
Excuse me. Did you say a
50,000 bump for Ervin Burrell?

122
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,592
Well, no, not
for Burrell per se.

123
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,366
Oh, for the next police
commissioner, then.

124
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,397
- That's what you mean?
- Well, looking ahead, it makes sense.

125
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,705
Because firing Burrell would
upset a good-sized block

126
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,473
of my constituency, not
to mention the ministers.

127
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,344
And I think the budget chair
might have a difficult time

128
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,747
allowing a higher salary
to be approved.

129
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,753
In fact, I can guarantee if
that proposal's in the budget--

130
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,778
your first, for the record--

131
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,983
the bill won't come out
of committee intact.

132
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,322
I'm just saying that in
the event Commissioner Burrell

133
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,453
were to leave, we'd want
to bump that salary

134
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,520
in order to attract
the best candidates,

135
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,293
in particular the best
African-American candidates

136
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,731
from across the nation.

137
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,600
With three years left in his term,
why would he leave?

138
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,236
Councilman, what may not have
been obvious to you

139
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,901
on the Public Safety
Subcommittee

140
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,503
is that the budget process
is a carefully orchestrated ballet,

141
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,913
a cooperative effort between
the branches of government.

142
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,075
Well, Madam President,

143
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,846
the nuances of that
cooperative effort

144
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,149
are beginning to come
into focus for me.

145
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,297
Thank you, Madam President.

146
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,102
Come on in, everyone.

147
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,164
Don't wait by the door.

148
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,574
Duquan, you're here.

149
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,976
Randy, you're here.

150
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,001
No, you two switch.

151
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,208
Calvin, you're here
in the front.

152
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,511
Quenice, you're here.

153
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,074
Michael, you're here.

154
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,346
Destiny, here.

155
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,320
Myesha, here.

156
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,617
Dashonda, here.

157
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,715
Come on, keep moving.
Don't stop at the door.

158
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,726
Come in.
Let's get started.

159
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,304
Could be a problem.

160
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,365
How so?

161
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,807
Your boy been assigned to

162
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,744
- what they call the Major Crimes Unit.
- Meaning what?

163
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,543
They the motherfuckers that did
the last three city wiretaps--

164
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,777
one where they bugged
Barksdale's office,

165
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,616
another where they hit
Kentel up in Park Heights.

166
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,588
And the last one-- shit.

167
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,558
They was all up on
Stringer Bell's cell phone.

168
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,389
You ain't still using
burners, is you?

169
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,054
I'm dumping them
every two weeks.

170
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,725
Not good enough.
You read that.

171
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,963
You'll see that Stringer was changing
his number every damn day

172
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,734
and they still pulled the motherfucker's
voice off a goddamn cell phone tower.

173
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,001
City police did that?

174
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,702
Where'd you get this?

175
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,375
Courthouse clerk's office.

176
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,509
Hey, the shit's
open to the public

177
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,817
after they finish
prosecuting your ass.

178
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,221
You need to lose
them cell phones, son.

179
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:22,387
Me-- I ain't as so much as
touched a burner in a year.

180
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,152
5'9" and 3/8?

181
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,450
You got it.

182
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,478
Now, hold the measure

183
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,015
and spread your
arms out to the side.

184
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,527
What you got?

185
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,892
I want one.

186
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,328
So, your cat can eat 'em?

187
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,661
So, how'd you find them?

188
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,297
I'm going to
the calculators.

189
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,265
Give me that.

190
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,296
Give it here.

191
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,673
The same.

192
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,202
Your height and your
arm span-- identical.

193
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,804
Quenice?

194
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,611
See, look. You about
to get me in trouble.

195
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,880
So, you say you
like to box, right?

196
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,251
You must have some
kind of reach.

197
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,585
Everything cheap
on computers

198
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,885
if you know where
to look for it.

199
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,382
Yo, this mean the price
I'm getting from the Koreans,

200
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,860
yo, they still
marking it up some.

201
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,192
They gotta be.

202
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,027
I can make twice
as much using this here.

203
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,556
Uh-uh.

204
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,590
Can't.

205
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,572
All this along the lower
Patapsco/Westport area

206
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,804
is ready for a turn.

207
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,075
The proximity to downtown
and the B.W. Parkway

208
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,844
make it ideal for Washington
commuters. That's a given.

209
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,351
- Anything to speed it up?
- A harbor promenade could work,

210
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,149
going west from both
sides of the bridge.

211
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,621
The South Harbor Promenade,
brought to you by--

212
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,147
Mayor Thomas Carcetti--

213
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,783
and the citizens
of Baltimore.

214
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,384
Doesn't quite have
the same ring

215
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,362
as a stadium or
an aquarium expansion,

216
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,921
- does it?
- It's a start.

217
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,126
Further east, you've got
the Locust Point Marine Terminal,

218
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,499
which, unfortunately,
is still a working enterprise,

219
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,663
and the further you go
into Brooklyn/Curtis Bay,

220
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,332
the more
the skyline disappears.

221
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,806
We lose
the Washington crowd.

222
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,433
For that part of
the waterfront,

223
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,341
- you're gonna need a different draw.
- Casinos?

224
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,209
Oh, the urban planning
default? I don't want to see

225
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,839
the kind of crime
that comes with casinos.

226
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,144
Tax base is tax base.

227
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,650
This is where
I get off the boat.

228
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,812
It's one thing to sell
waterfront for tax base,

229
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,583
but now you're just sucking
paychecks out of my community.

230
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,557
Well, it was just a thought.
And, anyway,

231
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,218
we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

232
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,387
This is just the first
long meeting of many.

233
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,058
So, thanks to everyone,
and we'll continue this later.

234
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,868
Madam President,
a word with you?

235
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,102
Do you have a minute?

236
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,078
You and me, we got
a problem already?

237
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,006
Just trying to help guide
you through the process,

238
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,146
Mr. Mayor... -Elect.

239
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,348
Felt more like you
were dragging me

240
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,619
across a minefield,
Nerese.

241
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,387
- Why you so pissed off at me?
- Look.

242
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,224
Clarence shouldn't have run again
for any number of reasons.

243
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,890
I was ready to step up,
and the deal was cut long ago

244
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,297
that he'd back me
when the time came.

245
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,734
You and Tony--
you guys jumped the line.

246
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,032
It wasn't your turn.

247
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,005
Oh, whoa. Whoa.

248
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,474
First of all, I'm sorry if Tony
and I ruined your party plans,

249
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,103
but I wasn't privy to whatever
you and Clarence cooked up.

250
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:30,605
That aside, I was kind of looking
forward to working closely together.

251
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,708
I think that we could
make things happen.

252
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,688
You're only getting
the one term, Tommy.

253
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,451
I'm not gonna stand
down next time.

254
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,550
What makes you think I'll even
be around that long?

255
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,026
Governor's race
is in two years,

256
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,222
and plans can change.

257
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,992
You might find yourself
mayor in 2008

258
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,261
without so much as
a campaign speech.

259
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,206
Wasn't easy
tracking you down.

260
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,741
The numbers I got for
you don't work no more.

261
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,844
I see you got
a problem.

262
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,583
Looking rough, Bubs.

263
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,454
I been keeping
it clean, you know...

264
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,220
pushing my carts and all.

265
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,285
But this one young man--
every time I cross him,

266
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,091
I get tossed
for what I got on me.

267
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,961
Cash, pills.

268
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,025
I mean, he look on me
like an ATM or some shit, I swear.

269
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,899
I'm ready to work, Kima.

270
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,201
Get this motherfucker off me,
I'll do what you need.

271
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,298
Look at me, Bubs.
I ain't in Narco.

272
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,866
Yeah, I see.
You look nice.

273
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,276
I'm working homicides.

274
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,574
So, if the bad boy
happen to kill me,

275
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,807
you can help me out then,
right?

276
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,546
If we drive around a bit,

277
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,350
you think you can put
eyes on this motherfucker?

278
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,378
I can try.

279
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,651
Get in.

280
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,056
So, Nerese is
bucking already.

281
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,291
Feels like if
the mayor's chair

282
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,357
ain't gonna go to Royce,
it should be hers.

283
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,028
Problem is she's gonna
see any proposal

284
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,536
to raise
the commissioner's salary

285
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,539
- as a move against Burrell.
- Which it is.

286
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,006
We can't raise the salary,

287
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,474
we can't attract strong
minority candidates.

288
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,533
No strong candidates,

289
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,738
we can't get rid
of the guy we got.

290
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,873
Fuck if I'm gonna live with
Burrell as my commissioner.

291
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,576
What if he quits?

292
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,914
Quits?

293
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,853
Maybe the man can be shamed.
If he leaves on his own account,

294
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,517
that takes us off the hook
with Nerese and the ministers, right?

295
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,294
No. I mean, we don't want
your credit card number.

296
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,796
I mean, we won't
even know the number.

297
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,731
We just need you
to order the candy.

298
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,233
And you have cash
up front?

299
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,293
He pay you back, Mr. P.
When he sell off, man,

300
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,326
he gonna pay you back.

301
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,066
Yeah.

302
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,267
Points on the
package, huh?

303
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,275
No way.

304
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,708
Aw, come on, Mr. Pryzbo.

305
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,770
I mean, doesn't it teach us
math? Addition, subtraction,

306
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,782
uh, a quarter,
a quarter of a dollar,

307
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,307
a dime, a tenth,
you know?

308
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,910
No cash, no card.

309
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,814
All right. Fine.

310
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,449
Cash up front.

311
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,323
No problem.

312
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,558
And if you come in with
a wad of bills tomorrow, Randy,

313
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,224
I want to know where
they came from.

314
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,826
I don't want either
of you out on the corner.

315
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,857
All right.

316
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,432
Ms. Thiessen, you okay?

317
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,534
Hey, uh...

318
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,135
I think my car's
been stolen.

319
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,880
Yeah, man.
All right...

320
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,718
so what I'm saying
is that you got from

321
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,486
Bentlow down there to
Rosewood right here.

322
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,492
All right?

323
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,823
Now, I got the block
from Monroe

324
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,192
all the way down
to Pacer,

325
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,491
so I got you covered
from that side,

326
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,361
but you gotta put lookouts
in Franklintown to catch anybody

327
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,799
- coming from the other way.
- All right, I got you.

328
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,927
- Are you ready to work?
- Yeah, just get my re-up.

329
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,699
We'll go on about
the shit for real.

330
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,901
- No, are you ready to work?
- Yeah. Ready to work.

331
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,311
- Donut, go talk to Little Kevin for me.
- All right. Watch the ride.

332
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:52,579
Hey, yo, look. Man, please do not be
having your mama come talk for you.

333
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,176
Man, I ain't have
her do nothing.

334
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,346
She just get on her horse
and come with it.

335
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,856
Look. I done did everything
I can for you and yours,

336
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:03,851
but from here on, your moms
can't do nothing to help. All right?

337
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,133
Him?

338
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,432
From Wee-Bey?

339
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,028
Your moms?

340
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,842
No sign of
the motherfucker Andre.

341
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,614
Store been padlocked a week.

342
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,815
Ain't even calling
for his re-up.

343
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,051
Huh.

344
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,287
Check the man at the jail?

345
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,919
Yeah.

346
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,362
People say Omar ain't even been
on the tier for two weeks,

347
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,831
so he either
staying someplace

348
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,164
or they got him
at county lock-up.

349
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,863
Or the charges
been dropped.

350
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,871
If this
cocksucker's sprung,

351
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,636
my man is backing
up on his story.

352
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,974
Mean he could
back up on y'all.

353
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,003
I'm on it.

354
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,112
How about
the New York boys?

355
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,780
We dropped five of them.

356
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,448
The rest went to ground.

357
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,014
Drive through East Baltimore,

358
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,653
you don't even see
a Baltimore nigger with a Yankee cap.

359
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,026
Want us to stay
on that, too?

360
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,624
I talked to the fat man,

361
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,361
but I think
we're done there.

362
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,037
This shit with Andre--
job one.

363
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,105
No.

364
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,345
We could try
the avenue again.

365
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,818
He be behind
the market sometimes.

366
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,411
Look, Bubs, I ain't
got all fucking day.

367
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,683
I'm on shift work now.

368
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,917
I'm working murders.

369
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,754
He banked me four times
this week, Kima.

370
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,023
I'm having dreams about this
low-bottom motherfucker.

371
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,495
All right.
I tell you what--

372
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,929
you want to work?

373
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,899
I'll call Sydnor or Herc
down at Major Crimes,

374
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,959
put you with someone
doing drug work.

375
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,631
You work for them, they'll
help you with your problem.

376
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,661
All right?

377
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,832
I need this now, Kima.

378
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,136
I'll tell them that.

379
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,438
Woman--

380
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,603
So show me where
you're living,

381
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,203
and I'll tell them
where they can find you.

382
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,703
Make the left.

383
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,659
I don't understand.

384
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,855
You told the man you not
gonna kill no one.

385
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,363
I gave my word on that.

386
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,865
Fuck we doing
back here then, Papa?

387
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,464
I can still put a gun
in Andre's face, right?

388
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,805
That man got some
explaining to do.

389
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,207
It's dead out here, yo.

390
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,011
Tip on out.

391
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,056
I don't know why he don't
trust us with it, yo.

392
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,291
I mean, we trustworthy,
ain't we?

393
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,294
Just gotta get enough for the first
order. Then we're good.

394
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,275
All right!
Hard six!

395
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,678
Come on, trey!

396
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,241
I'm in.

397
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,445
Go away, boy.

398
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,011
Oh, you in?

399
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,045
Yeah.

400
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,319
Pass line for me, yo.

401
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,889
Oh, shit!

402
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,161
Yeah. Get that money.
Get that money, shorty.

403
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,929
Get that money.

404
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,743
I heard tell of it,
but I didn't believe it.

405
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,768
All this overtime,

406
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,338
all for two cases
as a secondary.

407
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,407
First the names are red,

408
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,747
then they're green,

409
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:47,979
then they're black.

410
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,282
And that doesn't
even include the court pay

411
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,119
you make if the soft
case goes to trial.

412
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,624
Sweet.

413
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,151
So, what you gonna do
with yours, Detective Greggs, huh?

414
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,390
Pay down some debt.

415
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,769
- Why you leaving?
- Your luck ain't gonna change.

416
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,173
Don't worry
about that, man.

417
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,768
Yo, thanks for
walking us off.

418
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,473
I thought we was
gonna get banked.

419
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,913
You ain't gonna
bank us, is you?

420
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,348
Shit, boy.

421
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,146
You think I'm
that ungrateful?

422
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,016
I followed you
through 10 shooters

423
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,284
and made more money
that I have in a month.

424
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,848
Nah.
I ain't gonna rob you.

425
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,056
I just need to know next time
you fade a dice game. You feel?

426
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,996
I mean, it's all about
the math, you know,

427
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,430
the probabilities and all.

428
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,434
I ain't never seen
you in a game before.

429
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,901
Where you learn
your game?

430
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:38,994
Edward Tilghman Middle.

431
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,561
Shit.

432
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,073
All we got
is Little Kevin.

433
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,940
Oh, Bodie's boy, huh?

434
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,775
What'd I tell you? Bubs gets
it the first time. Here.

435
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,712
Y'all meet up with me
in the afternoon tomorrow--

436
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,844
after school lets out--

437
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,116
and I'll give
Kevin a new hat.

438
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,851
A hat trick?
Cool.

439
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,085
Yo, Herc, man?

440
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,616
What's up?

441
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,492
It's not about
the money this time.

442
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,588
He breaking me every day
unless I give him something.

443
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,100
I can't-- I can't
take it anymore, man.

444
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,465
Once we're done
with Kevin,

445
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,935
you go find this asshole,

446
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,801
hit my cell phone.

447
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,739
I'll be on him
five minutes later.

448
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,105
I promise.

449
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,013
Then you add this, yo,
and watch it fizzle.

450
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,245
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

451
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,548
Not so much.
Not so much.

452
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,487
You gonna make it spill
everywhere, you see?

453
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,292
What are you
still doing here?

454
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,090
Ain't nobody
want you here.

455
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,289
Your mama want me.

456
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,230
Yeah.
You and the pipe.

457
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,257
Shouldn't talk about your
mama like that, Michael.

458
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,601
- Hey, Daddy, see my volcano?
- Bug, go upstairs.

459
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,200
Bug need me, too.

460
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,177
Saturday, right?

461
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,371
Bug need me.

462
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,643
My teachers say
I gotta need glasses.

463
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,445
I gotta have
an adult with me.

464
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,748
Pick 'em up.
Sign for 'em.

465
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,618
Bug, go upstairs
to your room.

466
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,252
Ice cold, boy.
Where you be?

467
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,163
Ain't got a forgiveness
to your soul.

468
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,996
Man, fuck you.

469
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,865
Watch your mouth.

470
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,839
You're big,
but not big enough.

471
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,500
Now...

472
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,305
where's that D.S.S. card?

473
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,606
Your mama said
that come to me.

474
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,840
Ain't nothing left
on this month's check anyway.

475
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,782
Before the first
of the month, then.

476
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,768
- Hey.
- Hey.

477
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,176
Uh, come on in.

478
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,550
I see the little man done
took over the living room.

479
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,787
Good for him.

480
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,795
Well, you know how it goes.

481
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,662
Well, I'm just
messing with you.

482
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,961
Place looks great.

483
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,128
Even the toys look
like they belong.

484
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,830
This is...

485
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,704
this month and
two going back.

486
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,868
I'm just trying
to catch up.

487
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,038
I appreciate you not
coming after me for it.

488
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,014
Knocking over
liquor stores now?

489
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,516
Overtime from Homicide.

490
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,813
It stays like this,

491
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,685
and I won't have a problem
coming up with my share.

492
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,814
Kima--

493
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,483
this ain't,
"Please take me back,"

494
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,983
but a deal's a deal,
right?

495
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,896
Hey, I'm home.

496
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,162
Hey, Elijah.

497
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,463
Hey.

498
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,165
Um, Kima, this is
Nancine Owens.

499
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,970
Sorry.
The place is a mess.

500
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,636
You could stay for dinner,

501
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,805
but tonight we have
people coming over.

502
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,838
It's a kind of
a celebration, actually.

503
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,042
Yeah?

504
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,311
I passed the bar
this week.

505
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,285
Huh.
Congratulations.

506
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,289
Most of the gals I work with
have a problem with that.

507
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,312
With what?

508
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,790
Passing the bar.

509
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,553
Well, guess
I better be going.

510
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,724
Thanks for coming past.

511
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:28,994
Let's make bed...

512
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,023
Yeah.

513
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,695
Nice meeting you.

514
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,169
- Elijah?
- Huh?

515
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,365
Say bye to Aunt Kima.

516
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,532
Bye.

517
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,865
Uh-oh.

518
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,333
Where's Dre?

519
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,334
I don't know!

520
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,165
You believe her?
No.

521
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,730
One last time.
Where's Andre?

522
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,073
He-- he said if he told
me where he was going,

523
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,306
I'd have to tell you.

524
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,974
I don't know.
I don't know.

525
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,347
You believe her now?

526
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,352
Yeah.

527
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,757
Dang.
Sure is quiet this early.

528
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,561
Yo, you gonna come
with me to see Mr. P?

529
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,397
No, go on up. I'll see you
in homeroom.

530
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,062
All right.

531
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,534
Mr. P.

532
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,375
Randy.

533
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,142
Randy, how did you--

534
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,409
six beats four
or five.

535
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,974
And most times eight is better
than 10. Right?

536
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,509
You schooled me good.

537
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,715
- You gambled for this? I didn't even
- Pick up the dice.

538
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,020
I was all, "Pass,
no pass."

539
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,458
Got to the point where some
of them was following me in there.

540
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,688
You shouldn't gamble.

541
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,356
I know, but I'm just saying,
the math be right, Mr. P.

542
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,263
But I'm gonna
come back at lunch,

543
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,326
and we can computer up
that candy, all right? Peace.

544
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,475
Resign?

545
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,774
Either that or the day-to-day
running of the department

546
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,474
falls to the Deputy Commissioner
for Operations.

547
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,352
Erv, I have made no secret
of wanting to make changes.

548
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:32,152
Oh, so Bill Rawls is now
the voice of reform, is he?

549
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,248
This isn't about Rawls.

550
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,623
I have no faith in you,
given recent events.

551
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,629
I know you remember the two of us
sitting in this same booth

552
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,891
a year ago, you
telling me about

553
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,660
how you respect
the chain of command.

554
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,600
Well, respect it now.

555
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:47,196
Every department head serves
at the pleasure of the mayor.

556
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,366
So, if you're
firing me, Mr. Mayor,

557
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,275
I want you to know
I will go quietly.

558
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,336
You'll tender your
letter of resignation?

559
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,506
Oh, no.

560
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,778
I'm not offering
to resign.

561
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,547
If you want me to go, you're
gonna have to shitcan me.

562
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:05,750
A small distinction,
I know, but...

563
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,621
in the meantime,

564
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,628
since you have Bill Rawls
doing my job for me,

565
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,823
and it's such
a nice day out,

566
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:17,801
I think I'll go to
Forest Park and shoot nine.

567
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,895
The check is yours,
I think.

568
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,305
Pick a table, any table.

569
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:31,281
Eiffel Tower, Big Ben,
Empire State Building.

570
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,613
Your table is your team.

571
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,279
The team that puts its
model together first wins.

572
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,118
Now, you say y'all can work
together out on the corner.

573
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,623
Let's see how
you do on this.

574
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,285
Wins what?

575
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,352
Big fat gold stars
and some shit.

576
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,923
Dinner downtown. Any restaurant
you can agree on.

577
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,763
Since y'all only
seem willing to be

578
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,496
interested in stuff you know,

579
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,094
we looked for things
more like Baltimore.

580
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,538
The scale model of the
Fayette Street stash house

581
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,165
was all sold out.

582
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,676
So, y'all just gonna
have to make do.

583
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,578
Hey, um, Mr. Colvin, the box say there's
supposed to be some instructions.

584
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,105
We took those out. Makes it
more interesting, don't you think?

585
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,677
Yeah, it ain't like we follow
instructions anywhere else, right?

586
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,386
And I ain't even want to
put no charges on no more.

587
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,121
But see, they made me
do that,

588
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,392
and now they're gonna be mad
at me 'cause it ain't stick.

589
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,955
Who be "they"?

590
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,728
People I'm getting
the package from.

591
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,997
I'm asking who.

592
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,298
Boy named Marlo.

593
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:29,795
He's big on the West Side.
You heard of him?

594
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,274
Vaguely recall the name.

595
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,776
So, I just need to
chill for a while

596
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,244
till they remember
how to forget.

597
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,008
So, now you come
over East Side

598
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,515
and expect me
to hide you.

599
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,615
Why is it that every
Baltimore nigger think

600
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,985
that running the fuck away
means crossing downtown?

601
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,423
Shit, you ought to be in New York
or Philly or some shit.

602
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,361
No, see, I know that. It's just that
I don't know no one outside of B'more.

603
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,856
And I was just hoping, let's say,
trade out my store, you could maybe

604
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,926
front me some cash, get me
out of town with people you know.

605
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,835
I mean, I'd come to
the East Side to you,

606
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,363
but too many West Side
motherfuckers are with Marlo.

607
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,547
You know what the problem
with these here machines?

608
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,980
They too cheap
to begin with.

609
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:13,040
Some people would think
for what it's worth

610
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,348
to fix it and make
the shit work right,

611
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,651
you might as well dump
them and get another.

612
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,658
2,000 and a free ride north

613
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,561
for the store
and its contents.

614
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,327
Store worth way more, Joe.

615
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,425
It depends, don't it?

616
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,903
No, it goes on
the other side and shit.

617
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,480
Stop fucking fronting me.
I want to do something.

618
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,008
You gonna curse at me again,
I'm gonna cut you.

619
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,576
Get that shit
out my face.

620
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,612
I don't even want to
do this shit no more.

621
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,886
That's how you
always do it.

622
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,654
What are you doing?
Look at the box.

623
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,058
Do that look like
that's on the box?

624
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,256
I can't do this.

625
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,891
Nigger, come on, now.
I'm trying to eat.

626
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,958
- Give me that piece, yo.
- Fuck you, yo,

627
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,469
because you don't even
know what you're doing.

628
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,869
Just sit there and shut up
because you just don't know.

629
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,272
Come over here
and make me shut up, then.

630
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,673
Yo, you starting
to piss me off

631
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,733
'cause you don't know
what you're doing.

632
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:13,835
You're too stupid.

633
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,937
Hey, Z, you do the top
while I do the middle.

634
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,380
Darnell, you got
the leg parts, all right?

635
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:23,982
Yeah yeah.
Like that. Like that.

636
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,840
Shit!

637
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,411
Done.

638
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,721
Aw, that's bullshit.

639
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,454
He's cheating, yo.

640
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,018
Go ahead and touch
it, baby.

641
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,530
That shit
built to last.

642
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,589
What about the extra pieces?

643
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,657
What extra pieces?

644
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,702
What's in your pocket?

645
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,265
Ain't nothing in my pocket.

646
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,740
So, uh, who cook a good
steak around here?

647
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,578
Okay.

648
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,715
One-- From the day
of my inauguration,

649
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,554
Commissioner Burrell
is to undertake no initiative

650
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,184
without
clearing it with you.

651
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,717
Day-to-day administrative
responsibilities

652
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,161
are to reside with
the deputy office

653
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,687
if they don't already.

654
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,859
I like that.
No problem.

655
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,368
Two-- I need to elevate
Stan Valchek.

656
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,596
Good man, Valchek.

657
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,605
He's a hack, but he's my
hack, and I owe him.

658
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,867
If I make him
Deputy for Admin,

659
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,135
can he cause
any real damage?

660
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,903
I'll watch over him.
No problem.

661
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,503
Three-- I'm bumping Daniels
from Western Command to colonel,

662
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,012
giving him ClD
and carte blanche

663
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,241
to fix
the investigative units.

664
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,944
- Cedric Daniels?
- Problem?

665
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,111
No, he's good police.

666
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,450
He's just got...

667
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,615
a little
independent streak.

668
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,557
Independent from who?

669
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,326
I got no problem
making Daniels.

670
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,351
What else do you need?

671
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,194
That's it for now.

672
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,258
Mr. Mayor, about Ervin--

673
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,599
if you don't mind
my asking,

674
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,160
why keep him as
a puppet commissioner

675
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,432
when you can just
fire the guy?

676
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,605
We mind you asking.

677
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,724
I'm partial
to them cherries.

678
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,822
Yo, Dukie.

679
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:45,954
Hmm?

680
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,329
You ever call Social
Services on your mother?

681
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,890
What?

682
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,925
I don't know.
I just want to know what happens

683
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,938
if you call Social
Services on somebody.

684
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,633
You want to
report your mother?

685
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,642
She brung someone home
and he won't leave.

686
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,610
You don't want to
call Social Services.

687
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,135
They get to looking
into things,

688
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,943
they could put you
in a group home,

689
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,644
split you and Bug
up, even.

690
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:07,981
But I don't
want us to leave.

691
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,544
I just want
him to leave.

692
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,146
Talking about Bug's daddy,
ain't you?

693
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,919
Maybe you ought to
talk to a teacher about this.

694
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,894
I mean, Mr. Pryzbo is
real good about stuff.

695
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,898
Mr. P did say I could go talk
to the school social worker.

696
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,526
He an alcoholic.

697
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,332
Oh, um, what about that boxing
guy, Mr. Cutty?

698
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,169
What's wrong with Cutty?

699
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,704
I don't know.

700
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,907
Like, he just
too friendly, you know?

701
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,279
That shit
creep me out, man.

702
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,284
Like, he some type of
faggot or something.

703
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,683
Nah, not Cutty, man.

704
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,448
He be all up
in the women.

705
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,012
Yo, don't you see
how he be doing?

706
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,318
That don't mean shit.

707
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,257
Them faggots will be
just like that, too.

708
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,090
And I don't know.
He just too friendly, you know?

709
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,222
Everybody just too
motherfucking friendly.

710
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,809
No fucking way.

711
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,717
So, his name is--
what'd you call him?

712
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,311
It's like a joke.

713
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,913
Yeah. They flipped it.

714
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,457
- Bunch of fucking clowns.
- Mm-hmm.

715
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:29,156
Last year we had MSAs
in the 22 percentile.

716
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,335
And don't think they
haven't noticed it

717
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,361
down at the Puzzle Palace.

718
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:38,205
The word is they're looking for
at least a 10-point increase

719
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,769
from all city middle
schools this time around.

720
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,781
We're still six weeks
away from the MSAs

721
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,783
and you want us to start
teaching the test now?

722
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,913
This year, the preferred term
is "Curriculum Alignment."

723
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,949
There's nothing wrong
with emphasizing the skills

724
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,083
necessary for the MSA.

725
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,650
If we can get them
to write a paragraph

726
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,423
without a four-letter
word in it,

727
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,193
it'll have to have better
command of English.

728
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,665
Marcia, skill sets
are one thing,

729
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,793
but this has us teaching
test questions direct,

730
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,428
test questions
that involve skills.

731
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,495
I don't see your point.

732
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,165
You don't want
to see the point.

733
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,233
Were you really expecting
something different than last year?

734
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,210
I don't see the math section.
These are all language arts questions.

735
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,941
Our greatest failing on
standardized tests last year.

736
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,073
So, for the time being,

737
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,084
all teachers will
devote class time

738
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,281
to teaching language arts
sample questions.

739
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,219
Now, if you turn
to page 11, please,

740
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,590
I have some things
I want to go over with you.

741
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,254
I don't get it.

742
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,628
All this so we score
higher on the state tests?

743
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,293
If we're teaching the kids
the test questions,

744
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,700
what is it assessing in them?

745
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:39,725
Nothing.

746
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,998
It assesses us.

747
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,164
The test scores go up,

748
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,071
they can say the schools
are improving.

749
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,008
The scores stay down,
they can't.

750
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,638
- Juking the stats.
- Excuse me?

751
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,773
Making robberies
into larcenies,

752
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,307
making rapes disappear--

753
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:58,482
you juke the stats
and majors become colonels.

754
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,218
I've been here before.

755
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:03,455
Wherever you go,
there you are.

756
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,894
Raven's got that
dude Mike Anderson.

757
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,562
He and Jamal
gonna be running...

758
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:16,733
Look at these runts. We're gonna go
when that football's in the air

759
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:17,900
on a long pass.

760
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:18,931
Slow?

761
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:19,965
Yeah.

762
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,673
Big yellow right here.

763
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,702
Yellows, yellows!

764
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,340
Go long. Go go.

765
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,372
Throw it high.

766
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,884
Big yellow.

767
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,183
Go.

768
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,449
- Narco!
- Oh, shit!

769
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,354
Po-po,
yo! Po-po!

770
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,188
- Where you going?
- Put me down, bitch!

771
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,757
They're in the alleys.

772
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,632
We get back in there,
we can hunt them up.

773
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,638
No need.
I know 'em all.

774
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,936
- Let me go, motherfucker!
- What about this one?

775
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:50,998
He isn't even bait.

776
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,134
We toss him back--

777
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,438
unless you want to
spend half the shift

778
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,739
down at baby booking.

779
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:55,768
Me?

780
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,337
I ain't afraid,
motherfucker!

781
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,281
I don't want to spend this shift
down at Evidence Control.

782
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,807
Then why the fuck
even do this?

783
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,045
So's I can talk to them.

784
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,646
I like to think that until
the handcuffs actually fit,

785
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,589
there's still talking
to be done.

786
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,717
Come here, man.
Let's take a walk.

787
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,386
You shut the fuck up.

788
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,494
Yo, who we listening to?

789
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,696
Miss Lady Day,
Billie Holliday.

790
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,169
Yeah, she sounds good.

791
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,933
You know, real sad,
kind of.

792
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,399
Yeah. I'm like that.

793
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,637
You be thinking
I'm all ghetto,

794
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,976
and then I flip it and
mess your mind all up.

795
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,606
The next time we
do this, Mr. Colvin,

796
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,277
could you please
make it on the weekend?

797
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,910
I only had,
like, three hours

798
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,648
between school
and now to get ready.

799
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,087
Well, you look
fine, Zenobia.

800
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,351
I could look better.

801
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,258
How long you think it take
to do hair like this?

802
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,161
I'm ordering the biggest
quarter-pounder. Fries, too.

803
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,562
Nigger,
this ain't Mickey D's.

804
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,192
You better be thinking
T-bone steak, medium rare.

805
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,360
The blood
all squirting out?

806
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,767
Nah, ain't no blood.

807
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:53,861
What you think rare is?

808
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,667
It mean rarely cooked,
hardly cooked?

809
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,798
Rare.

810
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,308
Get the blood out, stupid.

811
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,331
See?

812
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,436
And medium rare,
keep the blood in.

813
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,446
All right. Look.

814
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,004
All I want to know
which is which

815
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,811
before I order
some undone meat.

816
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,408
- Hey, Mr. Colvin.
- Huh?

817
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,918
How it work?

818
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,944
Look, we're just
gonna ask the waiter. All right?

819
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,081
Oh, shit.
There's a waiter?

820
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,682
Just right
down the block.

821
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,154
Where she at, dawg?

822
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,525
Ain't seen her.

823
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,551
She owe me.

824
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,655
All that shit I gave her.

825
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,189
Yeah, I know.
I don't know.

826
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,596
How you not know?

827
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,195
I don't know.

828
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,900
She let me find her,
I'm gonna cut her titty off.

829
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,931
Watch.

830
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,409
You got something
to say, nigger?

831
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,775
No no.

832
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,279
Yo, where Herc at?

833
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,475
I got the asshole, okay?

834
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,144
Tell him Riggs and Calhoun.

835
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,346
He knows. He knows.

836
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,376
Okay.

837
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,658
Get the fuck back here.

838
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,595
Nigger, I will fuck you up.

839
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,292
You don't know Lex?

840
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,561
I knew the Bull.

841
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,830
I mean, I know him.

842
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,097
But he ain't been
around though.

843
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,332
You see? Right there.
You just fucked up.

844
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,341
You said you "knew" him,
like you knew he was dead.

845
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,775
No. Now you putting
words in my mouth.

846
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,642
I meant, "knew him."

847
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,080
When he was around,
I knew him. But he left.

848
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,549
Herc.

849
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,745
Bubbles called.

850
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,314
He sees the guy--
the asshole.

851
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,348
He's on Riggs
and Calhoun.

852
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,485
Says he'll
hold him there

853
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,518
five minutes for you
to get across town.

854
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,292
I'm in the middle
of an interview here.

855
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,128
What the fuck?

856
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,760
Tell him we'll fix
his problem tomorrow.

857
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,133
All right?

858
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,935
Oh, motherfucker.

859
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,704
He ain't got a phone.

860
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,439
You lied to me
out on the street.

861
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,607
Why should l
believe you now?

862
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,707
You was there
when Lex got killed.

863
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,275
You part of the
fucking setup.

864
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,652
We know 'cause we have a witness
who put you right in there.

865
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,054
Yeah, we do.

866
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,786
You know right
where that body is.

867
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,523
You were there with Snoop,

868
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,655
Chris, whoever else.

869
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,563
Know how to make
an interrogation work?

870
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,163
Leverage.

871
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,935
We don't have leverage?

872
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,602
Motherfucker,
you don't even got a body.

873
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,440
Lex is nothing
but a name in there.

874
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,049
Where the fuck
you think you're going?

875
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,416
You ain't going nowhere.

876
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:25,811
Hey.

877
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,423
Hello!

878
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,826
Home Depot here!
Home Depot!

879
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,454
What you got
for me tonight?

880
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,987
I've been missing you
all day long, dawg.

881
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,932
No no. We done with this right here.
We done with this.

882
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,696
Say what? Don't play, man.
I ain't got time for your shit.

883
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,727
My shit's all you're
gonna get, all right?

884
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,296
You can kiss my ass, all the
fucking trouble you given me.

885
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,372
Oh, hey.

886
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,741
What you looking for, huh?

887
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,109
It's not there.
It's on me, all right?

888
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,135
It's on you?

889
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,273
Yeah.

890
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,613
- It's on you?
- Wait wait wait!

891
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,620
Oh, no no no!

892
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,647
Get off me!
Get off me!

893
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,393
Come on! Get off!

894
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,725
Hey, wait wait wait!

895
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,060
You take it!
Take it!

896
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,189
I got you now!

897
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,221
No no no!

898
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,869
Like that?
Fuck!

899
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,443
I don't like the orange ones.

900
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,046
Listen to me, fuckhead.

901
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,351
We know you were there.

902
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,721
We know you set him up,

903
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,658
and we know you didn't
do it alone.

904
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,820
Say what?

905
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:38,851
You weren't alone in this.

906
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,989
We know that.

907
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,623
You mean Randy?

908
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,397
I'm asking you
questions, remember?

909
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,032
If you don't give us
this murder, Kevin,

910
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,838
somebody else will.
And when they do,

911
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,208
they'll be putting you in.

912
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,303
You hear me?

913
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,625
Colvin, party of four.

914
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,890
I'll make sure
your table's ready.

915
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,660
"Colvin, party of four," huh?

916
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,099
Hi. May I take your coat?

917
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,228
Sure.

918
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,465
You, sir?

919
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,268
Oh, no.
I'm good.

920
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,865
Yeah, me too.

921
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,044
Okay, your table's ready.

922
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,944
Follow me, please.

923
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,033
Sir?

924
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,057
That's your chair, right?

925
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,399
No.

926
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,461
You sit there.

927
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,807
The waitress
will be here soon

928
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:01,174
to detail the specials
of the day.

929
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,200
Enjoy.

930
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,873
Thank you.

931
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,040
Waitress?

932
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,310
Who was that?

933
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,647
That's the, uh, hostess.

934
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,152
Hey, you ain't
gotta worry, Mr. C.

935
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,312
I ain't gonna
run up your bill.

936
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,447
I'll just get
whatever's on special.

937
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,322
It ain't no K-Mart
Blue Light Special, dumbass.

938
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,125
Special just mean they
cook something different.

939
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,893
Yo, what about you,
drinking without a straw,

940
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,956
all ghetto and shit?

941
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,662
You don't drink water
with a straw.

942
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,500
And put that on
your lap, fool.

943
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,766
You see anybody
else up in here

944
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,001
Iooking all
Fred Flintstone
and shit?

945
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,532
Shh.

946
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:34,566
Shut it down.

947
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,206
Other people
be looking at us.

948
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,078
Hello. My name is Pam.

949
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,812
I'd like to tell you about
our specials for the day.

950
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,685
We have king salmon
with sweet corn,

951
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,190
chanterelles
and basil aioli;

952
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:51,217

served with mashed potatoes;

953
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:55,595
fresh Chesapeake Bay blue crab,
roasted garlic, shallot cream

954
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,498
and hen-of-the-woods
mushrooms;

955
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,559
and wood-oven-roasted
quail

956
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,504
with grilled bread salad.

957
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,473
Dang, I thought
y'all had steak.

958
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,497
Oh, we do...

959
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,875
on the second page
of your menus.

960
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,846
May I get your drink orders?

961
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,421
Yeah.
We'll take four cokes, please.

962
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,615
Right away.

963
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,681
Thank you.

964
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,404
Do you mind
if I come tomorrow?

965
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,836
Mind?

966
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,404
I--

967
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,849
You wouldn't
be embarrassed?

968
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,682
No, not at all.

969
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:57,382
I mean...

970
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,123
I'll be proud
if you're there.

971
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,461
It's funny
how it works out.

972
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,732
All those years I'm trying
to climb the ladder,

973
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,672
kissing ass, covering ass,
doing what I'm told.

974
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,108
I finally let some of it out,
tell 'em what I really think,

975
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,804
and I'm going from
lieutenant to colonel

976
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,076
in a little more than a year.

977
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,141
And, you, you're worried sick
about those subpoenas

978
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,709
and worried that Lester's
killing you with your boss--

979
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,846
But the subpoenas
get me promoted.

980
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:30,422
I know.

981
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,053
You know, Marlo
once said to me,

982
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,462
"You cannot lose if
you do not play."

983
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,556
But here we are, right?

984
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,536
Maybe it's changing.

985
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,877
What is?

986
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,247
The city, the way
things work or don't.

987
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,151
Maybe we're turning
a corner here

988
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,588
and it's not gonna be so
unbelievably fucked up anymore.

989
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,120
To Carcetti.

990
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,255
And us.

991
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,103
Zenobia,

992
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,629
you want to take a picture
of the restaurant, right?

993
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:17,799
That's okay.
It's late.

994
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:18,899
No no. That's fine.

995
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,000
Come on. Give
me the camera.

996
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,305
I'm okay.

997
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,870
Come on, give
me the camera.

998
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,903
Okay.

999
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,679
Y'all want to be in
the picture, right?

1000
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:40,060
Yo, Mr. C, can
we stop at McDonald's?

1001
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,463
- Fuck wrong with you, boy?
- Food wasn't right.

1002
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,932
Don't like fish.

1003
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,696
Why'd you order it, then?

1004
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,727
Yo, shut the fuck up.

1005
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,445
- Turn it down.
- What?

1006
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,881
Turn it down, Namond.

1007
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,350
Turn it up?
All right, you got it.

1008
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,919
Seriously, can we get
some fries at least?

1009
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,946
Boy, you is pathetic.

1010
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,652
Just 'cause you a girl do not
mean I won't fuck you all up.

1011
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:10,887
You hear me?

1012
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,919
Nigger, please.

1013
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,760
Yeah, you keep
talking all of that shit.

1014
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,095
No, you keep talking
all that shit.

1015
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,499
- Must have forgot.
- No, I ain't forget shit.

1016
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,366
- What I forget anyway?
- That I'm the man.

1017
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,496
Okay.

1018
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,996
So, what's
the first thing we do

1019
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,704
when we respond
to a prompt?

1020
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,905
Randy?

1021
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,881
"According
to the text..."?

1022
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:35,351
"According to the text."

1023
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,716
That's good.

1024
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,119
And how do we
end the answer?

1025
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,145
Quenice?

1026
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,452
- Huh?
- Come on.

1027
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,856
I know you know this.

1028
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:51,665
"The above-stated facts have
led me to conclude that..."

1029
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,828
Right?

1030
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,928
Okay.

1031
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,700
So, let's try to read
the third paragraph.

1032
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,001
I'll start it.

1033
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,066
"Pythias makes a final plea
to the tyrant Dionysius

1034
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,945
to return to his home
one last--" Calvin, pick it up.

1035
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,041
"To return to his
home one last time

1036
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,881
before his punishment.

1037
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:13,879
He denies the request
until Damon inter..."

1038
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,414
"lntercedes."

1039
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,862
"...and offers his own life
until Pythias returns."

1040
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,661
Good.

1041
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,997
Who wants to guess what
"intercedes" means?

1042
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,172
What about "plea"?

1043
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,607
Okay.

1044
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,311
What about the story, then?

1045
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,945
How would you summarize it?

1046
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:47,388
Duquan, give it a shot.

1047
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,119
"According to the text..."

1048
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,820
everybody's safe
in the end, right?

1049
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:54,957
Okay.

1050
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:55,987
Let's think this through.

1051
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,625
"According to the text,

1052
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,637
Damon offers his own life
on behalf of Pythias

1053
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,730
so that he can return home
one last time.

1054
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,571
The above-stated facts
have led me to conclude

1055
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,545
that Damon values Pythias'
friendship and loyalty."

1056
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,916
Any questions?

1057
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,185
We want four of the raw.

1058
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,385
275 large right there.

1059
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,793
For four
it should be three.

1060
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,094
I'm charging five a head on them New
York boys. That about the going rate.

1061
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,032
Still want us
on that?

1062
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:34,003
Nah, seems like they got
the message and went the fuck on.

1063
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,368
True that.

1064
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,397
Delroy has all of the
Monument Street corners back.

1065
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,876
All right, then. Holler at us
when the next package in.

1066
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,846
Uh, you remember when I told
you about the co-op meant

1067
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,711
we all stand together,

1068
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,774
doing for each
other when we can?

1069
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,082
You remember that?

1070
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,113
Well, the price of four raw
is 300.

1071
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,749
And your work on them
New York boys

1072
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,488
already been factored
into the price, you see?

1073
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,496
On the other hand,

1074
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,727
we got something that you want, and it's
coming back to you... free of charge.

1075
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,895
Someone you looking for.

1076
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,633
Co-op mean
what it sound like, dawg.

1077
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,734
You happy to do for me,
I'm happy to do for you.

1078
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,475
Congratulations,
Colonel.

1079
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,610
Congratulations,
Deputy Commissioner.

1080
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,778
Congratulations to all
those who were promoted,

1081
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,515
their families, and friends.

1082
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,113
It's a proud day for them

1083
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,092
and a proud day for the
Baltimore Police Department.

1084
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,428
I am so proud of you.

1085
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,200
Oh, thank you.

1086
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,440
You know, Valchek
we could have guessed.

1087
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:52,880
I mean, he's
Carcetti's man, but...

1088
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,349
Daniels?

1089
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,847
Long time for you to make major,
but this was quick enough.

1090
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,917
Yeah, who's your
new rabbi, huh?

1091
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,791
Colonel.

1092
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,456
So, they didn't
know the salad fork

1093
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,523
from whatever the fuck
the other fork is for. So what?

1094
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,468
I knew they'd be at a loss,
but the extent of it...

1095
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,630
I'm talking
about feelings--

1096
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,367
why they
feeling this...

1097
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,706
this plummet from masters
of the universe to abject fear

1098
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,644
to humiliated fury
and no awareness of it.

1099
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,010
Who says
they're not aware?

1100
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,378
Maybe they just
didn't acknowledge.

1101
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,077
Either way. But my point is,
where do you start with them?

1102
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:29,278
How you get them to
believe in themselves

1103
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,684
if they can't even
admit their feelings

1104
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,053
about who they are and what
they're doing in this world?

1105
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,116
They're not fools.

1106
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,320
They know exactly what
we expect them to be.

1107
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,057
Y'all missed some meal
for real, though.

1108
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,292
Take your seats.

1109
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,321
It was hot, yo.

1110
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,129
"Party of four,
Mr. Colvin."

1111
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,829
"May I take your coat,
Mr. Brice?"

1112
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,497
Ha!
That shit was tight.

1113
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,403
I'm dreaming about
that chocolate cake.

1114
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,465
Oh my God.

1115
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,706
Shit had, like,
56 layers, yo!

1116
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,235
"...in the check-room,
Mr. Colvin...

1117
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,352
"D Money saves Pitman"?

1118
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,922
It's bullshit!

1119
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,293
Before, at least they were
getting something out of it.

1120
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,069
To hell with my evaluation.
To hell with Donnelly,

1121
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,434
to hell with the
statewide test scores.

1122
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,268
I came here to teach.

1123
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,705
Right?

1124
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,582
Yo, Coach, seen Michael?

1125
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:35,607
Nah.

1126
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,984
All right.

1127
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,488
That wasn't you
and your runts

1128
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,321
I saw down on Bentlow
yesterday, slinging?

1129
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,687
Right.

1130
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,093
'Cause a gangster
like yourself

1131
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:47,790
wouldn't set up such
a weak-ass shop

1132
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,460
with no real lookouts,
ground stash in plain view.

1133
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,230
This is me telling y'all
as plain as I can.

1134
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,794
You guys had
your one chance.

1135
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,169
I see you out there
a second time,

1136
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,004
everyone takes a beating
and goes to Cheltenham.

1137
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,805
Fair warning you just got.

1138
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,937
Cheltenham for
some drug charges?

1139
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,241
Please, man.

1140
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,839
I'll write you up
as a special.

1141
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,110
Don't think I won't do it.

1142
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,448
Jab, jab! Good.

1143
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,919
He don't think
I can jail?

1144
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,888
Shit!
I can jail...

1145
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,891
- What's up?
- Namond's banging, huh?

1146
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,893
Yeah.
He's one of yours, right?

1147
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,519
He hang around
the gym,

1148
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,894
mostly waiting on
his boy Michael.

1149
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,592
He don't box or nothing.

1150
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,863
He ain't that kind, really.
Not like his father.

1151
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,166
- Who was his father?
- Dude named Wee-Bey.

1152
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,298
Stone-headed. Used to run
with them Barksdales.

1153
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,466
I know him.

1154
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,169
Shit, I locked him up
in Philadelphia.

1155
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,643
Yeah?

1156
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,145
Bey was my cut buddy.

1157
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,148
We jailed down Jessup.

1158
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,083
Anyway, Namond's from him.

1159
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,484
Same blood,
but not the same heart.

1160
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,186
I've done my
warm-ups, Coach.

1161
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,055
Yeah. We ready
for the ring!

1162
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,116
Take care, man.

1163
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,393
Why we stopping here?

1164
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,131
I thought we was
going straight out.

1165
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,435
Gotta get with
your escort out.

1166
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,373
Prop Joe said you
was my escort out.

1167
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,138
Manner of speaking,
that be true.

1168
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,881
Come on over here, man.
Come on.

1169
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,185
Chris, no.

1170
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,754
You know I keep
it quick, Dre.

1171
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,932
- Here?
- Here's good.

1172
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,664
Not-- not in a vacant.

1173
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,069
What's the difference?

1174
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,471
The difference
is my people.

1175
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,496
They won't know.

1176
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,530
They'll know.

1177
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,010
But-- but-- but
the rats.

1178
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,876
I'll be alone
with the rats.

1179
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,404
You're all right.
I got your back.

1180
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,438
Come on, Chris.

1181
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,349
Let me do it in
my house so my people--

1182
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,876
they can give me
a home go.

1183
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,061
I'll be damned.

1184
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,084
Que?

1185
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,758
Hey, yo, that got
to be Marlo, man.

1186
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,733
You see?

1187
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,326
That's the man we robbed, yo,

1188
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,564
from the poker game.

1189
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,539
Ah...

1190
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,803
si, si, si.

1191
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,106
No wonder the boy
don't like me.

1192
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,941
Hmmph.

1193
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,411
Thought maybe I could
catch up with Chris.

1194
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:37,582
I got a problem I can't
bring to no one else.

1195
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:57,670
Quien es?

1196
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,259
He just a kid.
