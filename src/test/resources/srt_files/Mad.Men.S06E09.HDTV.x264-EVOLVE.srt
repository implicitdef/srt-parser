<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:05,458
<i>You're going to
have a love scene.</i>

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,561
And between you, me and
soon a national audience,

4
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,359
it's more of a love affair.

5
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,446
Oh, my goodness.

6
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:13,092
I don't want to live on
the Upper East Side.

7
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:14,082
Why?

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,298
I saw us raising our kids in a place
with more different kinds of people.

9
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,944
We created a human life.

10
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:23,498
When you told me
about the merger,

11
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,667
I hoped he would
rub off on you.

12
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,667
Obviously, you're on his side.

13
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,954
Why did you do it all
off their sides?

14
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:58,615

15
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:10,304
It tastes better
because it's more expensive.

16
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,539
It's the premium brand
and it's priced accordingly.

17
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:14,441
Price is irrelevant
because the question is

18
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:16,510
does it taste
better than butter?

19
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,847
Butter is actually fresh.
Margarine is indestructible.

20
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,750
He's right because he's only
comparing different margarines

21
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,719
and margarine has a 70%
market share over butter.

22
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:28,821
But it's hard to say
any brand is luxury

23
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,823
<i>when although Fleischmann's</i>
<i>is the most expensive</i>

24
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,592
and Blue Bonnet,
owned by the same company,

25
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,160
is the least expensive,
the difference is only pennies.

26
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,397
45 cents a pound
is the highest.

27
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,533
29 is the lowest.
That's 50% more expensive.

28
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,134
Fleischmann's is Chivas Regal.

29
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,035
Still half the price of butter.

30
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,371
- It's Budweiser.
- But what's the market share?

31
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,072
I just said it's much
higher than butter.

32
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,041
Seeing as I have
the ear of the client,

33
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:54,012
it's my recommendation
we go on taste alone.

34
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,313
Peggy!

35
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,517
Don, I agree with you.

36
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,523
You're in the market
buying margarine.

37
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,525
Okay.

38
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,160
What goes through your mind?

39
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:13,263
Mouthwatering, savory,
delicious taste?

40
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:17,400
Or mouthwatering, savory,
delicious taste and price?

41
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,969
I'd buy the cheaper one.

42
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,906
There's one for 45 cents
a pound and one for 29.

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,341
Which one do you think
is gonna taste better?

44
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,445
It's a terrible gamble to tell a client
that their product is expensive.

45
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,880
Shh.
Let her answer.

46
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,984
I don't know.

47
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,486
They both sound good.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,821
Really?

49
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:40,522
Does everyone agree with yours?

50
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:42,424
It's not his and mine.
Everyone has an opinion.

51
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,892
We haven't heard it,
but I'm sure they do.

52
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:45,293
I like Don's.

53
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:47,095
What did Harry say?

54
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,264
I feel strongly both ways.

55
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,668
They're both so good.

56
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:56,637
I'd probably ask someone to run
them by the client on the sly.

57
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:58,272
The meeting's tomorrow.

58
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:04,511
You know what, Don?
Let's go with yours.

59
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:07,981
Nah, I'm not even
gonna be there.

60
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:12,151
You should go with whatever
you're most comfortable with.

61
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,096
Could you get me another
copy of that research?

62
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,965
I want to make it big
on a board.

63
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:31,704
Did you see that?
He didn't even turn around.

64
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:33,939
- Yep.
- Oh, it speaks.

65
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,840
Come on, I wasn't gonna
get in the middle of that.

66
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,174
You suddenly dumber than Peggy?

67
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,243
So you're content in silence?

68
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,112
I'm content with reality.

69
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,014
You know what this place looks
like to the outside world?

70
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,082
A mess. We don't
even have a name.

71
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:47,685
- We're the '27 Yankees.
- Says who?

72
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,655
Pete, you want to get
your balls tickled?

73
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,155
Go see a headhunter.

74
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,891
Are you leaving?

75
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,259
Look, when things settle down,
I'm gonna be a partner.

76
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:59,262
For the time being, it's nice to know
that the water's warm out there.

77
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,540
Did you lose something?

78
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:12,708
Yes.

79
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:14,977
I was looking for...

80
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:18,014
how do you say, a pen
to write something down.

81
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,951
Oh, well, the desk
is littered with them.

82
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:27,022
Would you like a drink?

83
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:28,857
Certainly, Colette.

84
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,792
Although this is
my husband's office.

85
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:32,126
I should be offering you one.

86
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,862
It is no trouble at all.

87
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,764
We're a lot alike.

88
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:38,967
We're both interested
in things that belong to me.

89
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:45,773
I don't know what
you're talking about.

90
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,741
I don't know what
your relationship is

91
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:50,010
with my husband, but it's over.

92
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:52,613
<i>Cut. Let's clean
up in there and back up.</i>

93
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,850
<i>Megan, sweetheart, what are
you doing on the floor?</i>

94
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:59,852
The script said
to spill the drink.

95
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,654
<i>It doesn't say to clean it up.</i>

96
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:03,355
I just thought...

97
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,224
<i>Your sister Corinne</i>
<i>is the maid.</i>

98
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:08,527
<i>You're Colette right now.</i>
<i>She's blonde, classy.</i>

99
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:11,597
<i>We need you to make</i>
<i>these women different, honey.</i>

100
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:14,066
<i>Let's take it</i>
<i>from the top, ladies.</i>

101
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,901
Don't worry about it.

102
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,610
I think Phyllis left for the day, but
I never saw the boards for tomorrow.

103
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:27,345
- Stan has them.
- Ah.

104
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,981
- What are you working on?
- Royal Hawaiian.

105
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:32,850
- How's that going?
- I'm sure you will tell me.

106
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:34,819
I will.

107
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:36,487
I'll look at it very carefully

108
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,456
and then I'll formulate
an educated opinion.

109
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,792
You should try it sometime.
It's what professionals do.

110
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,760
Don.

111
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:46,863
You've been debating
that for weeks.

112
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:49,565
- You both have a point.
- I'm not paying you to be a diplomat.

113
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,467
Well, you're both
more experienced than me.

114
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:53,236
I don't know
that my opinion matters.

115
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,704
Your opinion matters.

116
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,806
Now what do you think
is the best way to go?

117
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:58,708
- It's somewhere in the middle.
- No, Peggy.

118
00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:00,809
There's a right
and there's a wrong.

119
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,544
How could that be?

120
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,347
What you're really saying is
there's you and there's him.

121
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:08,350
And I don't know how I became in charge
of turning this into a collaboration.

122
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,552
Isn't that your job?

123
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,521
You're both demanding
and you're both pigheaded.

124
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,589
You're the same person
sometimes.

125
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,758
The difference is that
he's interested in the idea

126
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,592
and you're interested
in your idea.

127
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:23,430
He's interested in his idea.
Don't let him fool you.

128
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,900
Well, he never makes me
feel this way.

129
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:27,969
He doesn't know you.

130
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,652
Henry said you were leaving.

131
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,353
He just had to make
one phone call,

132
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:48,954
which turned out to be two.

133
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,322
Full house, I see.

134
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,591
He should be off in a minute.

135
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,426
Well, he's a lucky man.
But not as lucky as me,

136
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,162
because I wanted to be
alone with you all night.

137
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,330
He'll be out in a minute.

138
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:01,633
I don't think you heard.

139
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:05,937
I want to be alone
with <i>you</i> all night.

140
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:08,606
Mr. Dell, I have
three children.

141
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,141
I don't care.

142
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,678
No, look at me.

143
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:15,680
Can you believe
I've had three children?

144
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,457
How was your evening, Stew?

145
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,093
Raised a lot of money.

146
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:31,695
Darling, shall we?

147
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:42,171
- What's going on?
- There was an incident.

148
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,006
Oh, my God!

149
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,542
- They hurt you.
- I'm fine, honey.

150
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:49,678
He was getting off the subway
and two guys stabbed him.

151
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:52,114
- What?
- Hey, I don't want to worry her, man.

152
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:54,249
I'm sorry, but I'm trying
to get it straight.

153
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:57,485
And, frankly, she should know
so she can keep up her defense.

154
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,621
- Jesus, what happened?
- Are we done here?

155
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:03,358
For a reporter,
this is missing detail.

156
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:05,460
And if you'd waited
at the hospital,

157
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,662
as you were instructed,
we'd be done.

158
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,297
But for some reason you didn't.

159
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,032
I filled out the form.

160
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,701
Come on, were they colored
or Puerto Rican?

161
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:16,336
Or white?

162
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,773
I'm from Brooklyn and I
always keep my eyes down.

163
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:21,242
Could you describe the shoes?

164
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:24,077
Look, both of us have done
our civic duty.

165
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,545
So, respectfully,
I think you should go.

166
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:34,487
I'd get one of these.

167
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:38,424
Good evening, ma'am.

168
00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:42,161
Can you believe
those questions?

169
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:45,164
- Fascist pig!
- Shut up, Abe!

170
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:46,631
You don't know
what they look like?

171
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,100
You have a photographic memory.

172
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,734
Peg, I'm not gonna
give him an excuse

173
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,503
to shake down every kid that
walks through this neighborhood.

174
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,238
What about the one
that stabbed you?

175
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,007
This is a fucking police state

176
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,707
and we're gonna
have to fight, okay?

177
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,375
They did it in Prague.
They did it in Paris.

178
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,044
And, believe it or not, we're
gonna have to do it here, too.

179
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,180
That doesn't mean
protecting criminals.

180
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:05,850
Listen, baby, it's my right to
tell whomever whatever I want.

181
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,086
But you can keep talking because
everything you say is going in my story.

182
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,654
What are you talking about?

183
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,756
It's just fascinating,
the attitudes I'm encountering.

184
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,092
But why would you side
with the cops?

185
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,094
I don't know.

186
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,968
I read about this.

187
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:31,040
You obviously had
a traumatic experience

188
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,842
not unlike combat.

189
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:37,213
So I'm going to let you do
whatever you're doing.

190
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,448
Don't patronize me.

191
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:42,284
Those kids have no other
recourse in this system.

192
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:44,585
- They're animals.
- They were brought here by slave ships.

193
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,254
Well, I was
brought here by you.

194
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,723
I don't care if I take a loss,
I'm gonna sell this shithole.

195
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:52,327
You're worried about me
and I love you for it.

196
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,830
Now, I don't think
I can type with this thing.

197
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:58,732
Get my Olympia. Help me
get some of this down.

198
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,701
I'm going to bed.

199
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,211
This is nice.

200
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:15,414
It's Thursday.
Told you I was making dinner.

201
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,586
Sit down.

202
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,457
How was your day?

203
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,226
How was yours?

204
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,961
Hmm.

205
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,296
It was...

206
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,365
Ugh, it was terrible.

207
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,566
I don't even know
if I want to talk about it.

208
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,237
What's for dinner?

209
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,872
I think they hate me.

210
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,740
They just gave you
a second part.

211
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,443
I feel like an idiot
because they keep telling me

212
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,278
they can't tell
the twins apart.

213
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,980
I think I'm playing them
very differently.

214
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,883
It's not like
it's never been done before.

215
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,584
Exactly.

216
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,854
I told Mel I didn't want
to be a cliché.

217
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,124
Then he starts rapping about how
they're two halves of the same person

218
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:04,761
and they want the same thing, but they're
trying to get it in different ways.

219
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:19,241
Listen, would you mind if we
just go in and turn on the set?

220
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:20,776
I'm really not hungry.

221
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,678
Did you have a bad day?

222
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,148
I'm just tired.

223
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:30,852
Go lay down.
I'll clean up.

224
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:35,557
I already packed your bag
for Bobby's camp.

225
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,561
Tomorrow's another day.

226
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:49,903
John, could you give us
some privacy?

227
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:56,810
Was the evening a success?

228
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,445
You tell me.

229
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:03,549
Well, I--

230
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,185
I found it fascinating as usual

231
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,821
watching you work your magic.

232
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,056
And while you were watching me,

233
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:14,259
everyone was watching you,
weren't they?

234
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,802
Stewart did everything
but grab your ass.

235
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,540
I didn't notice.

236
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:30,542
What did he say to you?

237
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:35,946
I don't want to get
anyone in trouble.

238
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,948
Word for word.

239
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:44,488
He said he wanted
to be alone with me.

240
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,293
What else?

241
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:52,294
All night.

242
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:05,107
Daddy, I don't want him
running on the steps.

243
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:07,108
Why not?
Kids are supposed to run.

244
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:09,711
Ellery, come down.

245
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,479
We don't have any steps
in the apartment.

246
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:12,848
He's not good at them.

247
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:17,886
So what do you think, girls?

248
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,621
See any resemblance?

249
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:21,657
He's very handsome.

250
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:23,658
So, Ellery, take a good look.

251
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,627
Who's your type?

252
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,462
Hello, Margaret.

253
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,130
I'll tell you mine later.

254
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,066
It's nice to see you.

255
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,902
Oh, he's precious.
How old is he?

256
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:38,305
He's four. He's having a
special day with Pop-pop.

257
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,406
We're going to the zoo
and maybe the movies.

258
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:41,975
So it's just a regular workday.

259
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:45,511
Don't fill him full of junk.

260
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,547
Can't promise that.

261
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,417
Wave good-bye, swabby.

262
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:52,752
We're shoving off.

263
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:58,190
How many times
have you met with Harry?

264
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:00,726
Too many. Don't waste
my time like Crane.

265
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,962
I'm a headhunter,
not a fan club.

266
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:05,664
Fine, let's talk about me.

267
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,733
Let's talk about Burt Peterson.

268
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,902
I got him a vice
presidency at McCann.

269
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,903
If he keeps his head down,
he's set for life.

270
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:16,373
But the merger was fresh.
I don't know your situation.

271
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:18,009
You weren't very straight
on the phone.

272
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,644
You think they're gonna
cut you loose?

273
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,513
How come you didn't
get yourself a job?

274
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,917
That's a Yankee wrinkle.

275
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:28,752
- You interested in my business?
- No.

276
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:32,789
Well, if we sat down
a couple of months ago,

277
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:34,758
this would have been
a different conversation.

278
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,627
Nothing's changed.
I'll show you my Rolodex.

279
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,896
It's not that. It's your lack of a
role in the management structure.

280
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:43,065
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce
Cutler Gleason and Chaough?

281
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,500
Who the hell's in charge?

282
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,535
Two of those men
are as dead as doornails.

283
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,938
There's still a lot of chiefs
and only a couple of Indians.

284
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,973
And a lot of questions.

285
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,808
What the hell
happened with Vicks?

286
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,712
So...

287
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:58,447
paint me a new portrait.

288
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,882
I'm glad you said that.

289
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,284
How about seeing things
from the client side?

290
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:06,187
There's a head of marketing job in
Wichita that you'd be perfect for.

291
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,756
Anything back here on Earth?

292
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,791
You know,

293
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,259
I've always liked you,
Campbell,

294
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,028
so forgive me for saying this,

295
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,329
but if you do a little better,
I can do a lot better.

296
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,632
I don't know
what else I can do.

297
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,603
I've been you

298
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,104
and I went on interviews

299
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,441
and I realized I was filling
the room with desperation.

300
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:31,344
Five cents worth
of free advice.

301
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,313
You've got to spend
less time in this place

302
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:34,648
and more at home.

303
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:37,050
This is a reluctant necessity.

304
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,552
My mother's run amok.

305
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:42,622
Pete, one day
I looked in the mirror

306
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:45,325
and I realized I had regrets
because I didn't understand

307
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,060
the wellspring
of my confidence.

308
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:48,260
Gin?

309
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,128
My family.

310
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:53,065
My family is a constant
distraction.

311
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,734
You better manage that

312
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,570
or you're not gonna
manage anything.

313
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:08,680
Hey, buddy.

314
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,458
Can you help me?

315
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,860
I'm occupied
at the moment, sir.

316
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:37,806
Hello there.

317
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:42,378
Oh.
Are you lost, too?

318
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:44,547
Not yet.

319
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,782
I'm trying to get some gas.

320
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:48,851
Lady asked for directions.

321
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,653
Fill 'er up with regular.

322
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,756
Where's Henry?

323
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,259
He's coming tomorrow.

324
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,394
I'm surprised you
were able to get away.

325
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,764
Where are you staying?

326
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:04,666
Somewhere over here.

327
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,305
Just go down here. Stay
on here a mile and a half

328
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,474
till you get to the big mill.
Make a left.

329
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:15,609
Go back through town
till the railroad tracks.

330
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,144
Hang a right over the bridge

331
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,212
and then you come
to the little mill.

332
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,181
Do any of the roads have names?

333
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,583
Follow me.

334
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,733
Fleischmann's just called.

335
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,268
See? You were worried
for nothing.

336
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:37,304
Well, they just requested some more
recent figures on market share.

337
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:38,840
I'll handle it.

338
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,541
Peggy, may I speak with you?
Go ahead.

339
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,380
What the hell were you
doing back there?

340
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,215
You didn't want me to talk.

341
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,019
I didn't talk. That was the plan.
Did you want me to talk?

342
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,587
- No, you touched my hand.
- What?

343
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,422
When you handed me the board.

344
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,990
What?
No, I didn't.

345
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:01,160
Yes, you did. And you can't
do that in a presentation.

346
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,796
I doubt anyone saw that because
I didn't even know I did it.

347
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,832
It jarred me. And when I finally
caught up, then you smiled.

348
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:09,201
You can't smile
at me like that.

349
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,569
I never should have kissed you.

350
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,944
I assumed we were
forgetting about that.

351
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:23,915
I forgot it.

352
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,651
Well, I haven't.

353
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:30,320
Oh.

354
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,491
What an old tune.

355
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,661
The boss in love
with his protégé.

356
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:40,597
Is this all me?
Because that'll help.

357
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,466
I think about it.

358
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,104
Well, we can't. I have
someone, you have someone.

359
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:51,407
And believe me, I've considered
it a lot further than that.

360
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,643
I didn't know
you felt this way.

361
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:01,416
I don't want to,
that's the point.

362
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,885
Now I realize I never
should have brought it up.

363
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,889
Do you want me
to work someplace else?

364
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,557
No.

365
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:10,926
Of course not.

366
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:24,304
Come on, you have to do it.

367
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,075
And the left.

368
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,213

seven sons, seven sons ♪

369

370
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:37,550
Daddy, you came!

371
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,054
You didn't tell him I was here?

372
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,422
I wanted it to be a surprise.

373
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:45,158
You catch any fish?

374
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:48,161
Damn it, I made you a wallet,
but it's back in my cabin.

375
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,461
Bobby, language.

376
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:51,463
We'll get it later.

377
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,469
Mommy said we can have
anything we want.

378
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:59,872
Hi!

379
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,573
This is my mom and dad.

380
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,643
That's Bobby Two.
He's shy.

381
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:08,146
Are you Bobby or Bobby One?

382
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,613
I'm Bobby Five.

383
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,849
It's sad. There's no
Bobby One anymore.

384
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:13,617
Because of Bobby Kennedy?

385
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:15,586
No, he went home.

386
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,189
Do you want me to get the
waitress so you can get a drink?

387
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,058
- Is that possible?
- No.

388
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:25,061
Mommy's having a chef salad
and I'm having a cheeseburger.

389
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,863
What do you want
so I can order?

390
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:29,132
What's good here?

391
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,334
I'm afraid nothing.

392
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:33,569
Daddy, I want
to teach you this song.

393
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,272

Can I walk you out?

406
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,105
Certainly, if you
don't mind waiting.

407
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,011
I need your advice.

408
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,580
And, well,
it's of a personal nature

409
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,850
and thus above Clara's
security clearance.

410
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,751
How can I help you?

411
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,255
Do you feel my attention
to business has been dilute?

412
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,499
How personal
is this conversation?

413
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:45,170
I'm being pulled
in a million directions.

414
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,306
My wife, my child, my mother.

415
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,175
I can't solve
those problems, Pete.

416
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,943
I have those problems.

417
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,711
I live with my mother.

418
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,081
Has your mother exhausted
every nursing agency?

419
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,249
No, but she's exhausted me.

420
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,817
Well...

421
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,153
the options are
my home and a home,

422
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,322
neither of which
will make me feel better.

423
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,324
I am sorry to hear that.

424
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:11,929
- Do you want to get supper?
- I can't. I have plans.

425
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,168
Thank you, Joan.

426
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:22,005
- For what?
- I don't know.

427
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:29,771
Welcome.

428
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:31,739
Oh, I'm a little damp.

429
00:22:31,774 --> 00:22:33,374
Did it finally rain?

430
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,277
No, but I walked.
This was cold when I left.

431
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,445
You walked from the West Side?

432
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,549
What an incredible space.

433
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,050
Did you do this yourself?

434
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:46,186
Oh, I had a little help.

435
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,723
Arlene, you read about the
shootings in the park, didn't you?

436
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,825
I'm not gonna let
a few lunatics

437
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:53,592
ruin a gorgeous night
like this.

438
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,134
Should I go get my script?

439
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,870
Megan, darling,

440
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:06,739
you're a good actress

441
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,640
on your way to becoming, well,

442
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:10,442
at least a successful one.

443
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,711
There's nothing I can
tell you about that script.

444
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:14,679
I came over here because
I'm worried about you.

445
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:16,748
Am I gonna get fired?

446
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,852
I remember my first job.

447
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:22,454
Believe it or not, in radio.

448
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,288
"Against the Storm."

449
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:28,425
Very classy, a lot of
big words, high morals.

450
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,794
And my agent,
who I later learned

451
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:32,596
was angling
to sign Roger DeKoven,

452
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,665
told me my voice was childish.

453
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:36,567
And every day I would
vacillate between

454
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:39,035
"Arlene, you're wonderful"
and "Arlene, you're caca."

455
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,505
Which was it?

456
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,540
Honestly?

457
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:46,576
I was wonderful.

458
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,050
You should go inside.

459
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,885
You'll get eaten
alive out here.

460
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,220
You know mosquitos ignore me.

461
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:00,889
In those shorts?

462
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:07,128
Did you find a bottle?

463
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:09,865
Maybe.

464
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,946
Cheers.

465
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,854
I loved camp.

466
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,692
I never went.

467
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,594
Yes, you did.

468
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:46,398
Remember when we went to Lake
Champlain with my parents?

469
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,569
I remember.

470
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:52,538
And you got in a horrible
fight with my father

471
00:24:52,572 --> 00:24:54,372
about who would
carry the luggage.

472
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,811
And then we went in the
woods and made Sally.

473
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:03,681
I don't understand her.

474
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,585
Henry says
she's a lot like you.

475
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,720
How would he know?

476
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:11,989
He says she reminds him of you.

477
00:25:12,023 --> 00:25:14,258
I think she's a lot like you.

478
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:19,395
Bobby reminds me of my father.

479
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,064
So bossy.

480
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:26,069
All the teenagers
of the world are in revolt.

481
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,710
What were we like?

482
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,246
You and me?

483
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:43,953
When I saw you earlier today

484
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:46,889
I thought for a second,
"Who is that man?"

485
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:50,692
And I forgot how mad
I was at you.

486
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:56,664
Ugh, I don't know what's
happened, but I'm all bit up.

487
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,364
Close the door.
You'll let the bugs in.

488
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,450
What are you doing?

489
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:56,587
Waiting for you
to tell me to stop.

490
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:13,570
What did you think
when you saw me?

491
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:16,539
That you are as beautiful
as the day I met you.

492
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:29,818
So finally I said to Mel,

493
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:33,121
"I'm either his mother or his girlfriend.
I can't be both."

494
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:34,823
That's bad writing.

495
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:37,025
You're so lucky he's at work.

496
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,128
Please, dear, that's a
complex relationship.

497
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:42,229
But he understands what you do

498
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,098
and he wants you to be great.

499
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:46,400
And he's always proud of you.
I've seen it.

500
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:48,970
Don's very proud of you.

501
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:51,639
You can tell
by how protective he is.

502
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:56,510
It's been so different.

503
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,614
You know, we worked together
and I left to pursue this.

504
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,682
And he was so encouraging.

505
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:05,351
And then you
started succeeding.

506
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,320
He's old-fashioned.

507
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,922
He'll get used to it.

508
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,257
I think he did.

509
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:15,327
And I think he got used
to me not being around

510
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,497
and having a bunch of problems
that he couldn't solve.

511
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,034
And I don't know

512
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:25,604
if it's him or me, but...

513
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,372
I feel so lonely.

514
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,746
Arlene.

515
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,447
What?

516
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,982
I want to make you feel better.

517
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:40,451
This isn't the way.

518
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,755
Forget it.

519
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,391
I can't believe you.

520
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:51,995
I'm trusting you and you're taking
advantage of every private moment.

521
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,132
Well, what was I
supposed to think?

522
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,501
You invited me over.

523
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,070
Your husband's not here.

524
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:01,937
Two bottles of wine
to go over a scene

525
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,438
a child could understand.

526
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,174
"I'm so lonely."

527
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,843
I work with you and your
husband is my boss.

528
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:09,478
And now what am I
supposed to do?

529
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,881
Am I gonna be punished
for not doing something

530
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:13,849
that you won't stop
trying to do?

531
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,918
Megan, it's okay to say no.

532
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:18,286
But you don't have
to embarrass me.

533
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,955
I'm sorry.

534
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,424
I didn't mean to.

535
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,993
No, stop it.

536
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,795
You're a tease.

537
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,329
Fine.

538
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:32,200
No, I'm fine
with being a tease.

539
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:37,171
Well, honey,

540
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,872
just learn the lines.

541
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:41,809
Two characters is tough,
but you know what Olivier says,

542
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,811
let the wig do the work.

543
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:48,148
I'm gonna go
before I--

544
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:51,417
well, it's too late
for that, isn't it?

545
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:53,086
Thank you for that.

546
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:56,989
No hard feelings.

547
00:29:57,024 --> 00:29:59,092
Status quo ante bellum.

548
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:01,594
Everything as it was.

549
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:24,613
I missed you.

550
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:37,992
Do you feel guilty?

551
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:40,128
No.

552
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:42,630
This happened a long time ago.

553
00:30:52,774 --> 00:30:54,507
Ugh, menthols.

554
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,677
I don't miss that.

555
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:07,686
Is this what it would have been
like if we'd stayed together?

556
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,558
I don't think about
that anymore.

557
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:17,062
I'm happy in my life.

558
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:19,364
Let's just enjoy this.

559
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:22,600
But you used to?

560
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:26,537
What are you thinking
right now?

561
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,241
I'm thinking about
how different you are,

562
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:32,243
before and after.

563
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:37,115
I love the way you look at me
when you're like this.

564
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,951
But then I watch it decay.

565
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:45,422
I can only hold
your attention so long.

566
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,395
Why is sex

567
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,564
the definition of being
close to someone?

568
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:57,800
I don't know,

569
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,768
but it is for me.

570
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:01,871
It is for most people.

571
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,342
Just because you climb a mountain
doesn't mean you love it.

572
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:08,044
Climbing a mountain?

573
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:10,345
Is that what
making love is to you?

574
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:13,448
If we'd lied here together
with you in my arms,

575
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,917
I would have felt
just as close.

576
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:19,287
Not the rest of it.
I don't know.

577
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:23,959
I don't know.

578
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:26,126
It doesn't mean
that much to me.

579
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:30,264
Is it the same with Megan?

580
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,235
Why do you want
to talk about that?

581
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,636
That poor girl.

582
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:44,844
She doesn't know
that loving you

583
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,546
is the worst way to get to you.

584
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,667
Are you sure you don't
want to just hold me?

585
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,424
Oh, Jesus.

586
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,360
Oh, thank God.
What are you doing in here?

587
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,062
I was just fixing the window.

588
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:40,563
What the hell happened here?

589
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:42,732
I'll replace it tomorrow
when I get back from work.

590
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:44,367
Because you're leaving me here

591
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,135
after someone threw a rock
through our window?

592
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,736
That's not what happened.

593
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,672
Well, I came in here and there's
glass all over the floor

594
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:52,942
and you're holding a rock.

595
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:55,610
I'm tired of being
interrogated in my own home.

596
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:58,380
Do you think they saw you
talking to the police?

597
00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:00,449
If you're gonna let
your imagination run wild,

598
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:01,650
come to the paper
with me tonight.

599
00:34:01,684 --> 00:34:03,818
Abe, I have to go
to work tomorrow.

600
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:05,286
And this is our bedroom.

601
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:07,255
Someone was in our yard.

602
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:09,123
I'm really scared here.

603
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:11,592
And you're going to protect me?
You only have one hand.

604
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:18,765
You're right.
You're right.

605
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,969
We'll start looking.
Put it on the market.

606
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,540
You'd really do that for me?

607
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:30,444
Maybe we're not cut out
to be pioneers.

608
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,124
Sleep in the parlor if you're worried.
I won't wake you.

609
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:51,329
Hello?

610
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:54,699
You took a four-year-old
to see "Planet of the Apes"?

611
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:57,302
He's been having
nightmares all night.

612
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:58,769
Hold on, hold on.

613
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:00,472
He wanted to see that.

614
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:02,240
He doesn't decide that.

615
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,142
Well, Don took his kid.

616
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:07,344
Don Draper, Father of the Year.

617
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:09,313
Margaret, honey, he loved it.

618
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:12,116
Put him on, I'll do Dr. Zaius again.
He laughs like an idiot.

619
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,751
The Forbidden
Zone was once a paradise.

620
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:16,720
You're not funny, Daddy.

621
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:19,789
We'll probably have to get rid of
the dog; he's that afraid of fur.

622
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,994
Listen, I saw "The Golem"
when I was his age.

623
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:25,795
You don't even know
what scary is.

624
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,463
I was fine.
It's not my fault.

625
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,800
Yeah, you're right.
It's my fault.

626
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:33,102
For letting you talk me
into having a four-year-old

627
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:34,571
watch another
four-year-old.

628
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:37,641
Listen to me, young lady,
you calm down this minute.

629
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:39,441
No, Daddy, you listen to me.

630
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,844
You can keep up your fantasy
of acting like a father,

631
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,445
but your grandfather
days are done.

632
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:46,448
I'm sorry you're upset.
I'm coming over.

633
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,283
- I'll calm him down.
- <i>No.</i>

634
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:50,252
And call Mother next time
you want to see him

635
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:52,487
'cause she has to be there.

636
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:25,151
- Morning.
- Good morning.

637
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:26,786
Good to see you.

638
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:52,879
It's such a project
going to the beach.

639
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:54,380
Can I go get Kevin?

640
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:56,082
Let him sleep a little more.

641
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:58,251
I'd love to get one
of those summer rentals.

642
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,820
Doesn't Pete Campbell
have a beach house?

643
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,656
I wouldn't ask him
for anything.

644
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,191
- Don't you like him?
- It's not that.

645
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:09,028
Actually,
he's the only person there

646
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,663
who's never broken
a promise to me.

647
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,765
He's a very generous person.

648
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,067
And frankly, I think
he's having a rough time.

649
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:17,269
So he told you
about his mother?

650
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,737
No, I wish he would have.
What's wrong?

651
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:22,040
He needs a nurse.

652
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,341
He's not gonna ask you.
He's too ashamed.

653
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:27,011
She back from the track already?

654
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:30,048
Ugh, she must have
forgotten her keys.

655
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,518
Oh, hello, Roger.

656
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,389
- Who are you?
- It's me, Bob Benson.

657
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,457
From the office.

658
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,995
What are you doing here?

659
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,430
Oh, I was out shopping

660
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:50,167
and I realized I had
misplaced some paperwork.

661
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,634
And I, uh--

662
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,403
what are you two doing?

663
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,038
We're leaving for the beach.

664
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,174
- You know what? I should go get the car.
- Good idea.

665
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,242
No, Mr. Sterling
is just leaving.

666
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,013
Roger, I'm sure
this can wait till Monday.

667
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:07,015
Sure, absolutely.
Sorry about that, Bob.

668
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:09,283
I guess we're all a little bit
out of context right now.

669
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:11,119
I take no offense.

670
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:24,198
Didn't know you were friends.

671
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:27,134
Some people never stop working.

672
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:29,636
I'm going to freshen up
and we'll get out of here.

673
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:37,111
<i>Hey, get off our lawn!</i>

674
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:01,099
What's going on?

675
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:03,502
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

676
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:05,070
Jesus!

677
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:08,240
Why didn't you say something?

678
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:10,576
- What do I do?
- Don't pull it out.

679
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:16,781
- If I don't make it--
- Stop it.

680
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:20,351
You're going to make it.
He's going to make it.

681
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,457
Look, I don't want you to think
this is about what you did.

682
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,827
It was an accident.
I feel horrible.

683
00:39:30,861 --> 00:39:33,463
No, you're scared.

684
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:38,034
You're a scared person
who hides behind complacence--

685
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:39,869
cy.

686
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:42,138
Save your strength. You're
not making any sense.

687
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:44,173
I don't know why
I thought you'd be braver.

688
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:47,075
You're... in advertising.

689
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,413
Don't do this right now.
I said I was sorry.

690
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:56,251
Your activities are offensive
to my every waking moment.

691
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,287
I'm sorry...

692
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:02,089
but you'll always be the enemy.

693
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:06,294
Are you breaking up with me?

694
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:12,634
Got to hand it to you.

695
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:16,837
You gave me a great ending
to my article.

696
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:44,263
Oh, you're back.

697
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,035
Did you have fun?

698
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,372
I missed you.

699
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:57,576
Well, I miss you all the time.

700
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,782
I don't know when I started
pretending like everything was sunny.

701
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:14,558
I don't know where you've gone,

702
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:16,594
but I'm here.

703
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:22,599
I keep trying to make things
the way they used to be,

704
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,901
but I don't know how.

705
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:27,103
And maybe that's stupid

706
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,672
or young to think
like that, but...

707
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:34,277
something has to change.

708
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:39,147
Megan...

709
00:41:45,622 --> 00:41:47,589
You're right.

710
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:49,591
I haven't been here.

711
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,654
Roger, please.

712
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:22,589
Come on, just take it.

713
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,990
They're Lincoln Logs.

714
00:42:25,024 --> 00:42:27,626
I thought maybe he'd build
his mother a house.

715
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:29,562
You can't drop in
on me like that.

716
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:31,196
But I want to.

717
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,333
Oh, Roger, I'm so sorry,

718
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,968
but you can't do this.

719
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:37,369
Why not?

720
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:39,671
Because it's too confusing.

721
00:42:39,705 --> 00:42:41,873
For Kevin.
You know.

722
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:45,242
But I'm his father.

723
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,278
No, his father is Greg.

724
00:42:47,312 --> 00:42:48,880
But I'm here.

725
00:42:50,649 --> 00:42:52,617
For now.

726
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:56,353
But every day Greg
is some hero out there.

727
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:59,389
And I'd rather him think
that is the man in his life.

728
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:02,626
Who's gonna watch TV with him?
Bob Bunson?

729
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,695
I just want to be around.

730
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:07,430
I know you want to.

731
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:09,700
But I can't count on that.

732
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,677
Thank you for the gift.

733
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:36,590
Something delicate
has come to my attention.

734
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:39,160
Have a seat.

735
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:42,897
I...

736
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:45,733
I've really debated whether
to bring this up with you

737
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:49,170
because I don't want to put
you in a strange position

738
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:53,140
and in the end
it's probably just gossip.

739
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:58,412
It's come to my attention

740
00:43:58,446 --> 00:44:01,348
that you may be in need
of a nurse for your mother.

741
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:03,650
Joan had no right
to tell you that.

742
00:44:05,053 --> 00:44:07,086
His name is Manolo Colón.

743
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,688
He's an army-trained
registered nurse

744
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:11,490
and he's available now
only because

745
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:14,060
he's brought my father
back to full health.

746
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:21,167
Is he Spanish from Spain?
Because otherwise Mother will refuse.

747
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,435
He's very well-bred.

748
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:29,006
And don't blame Joan.

749
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,675
She was concerned about you

750
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,743
and had exhausted her resources

751
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,512
and is well aware
that your well-being

752
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,614
is also an interest of mine.

753
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:49,226
Good morning.

754
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,661
- Is he in?
- Yes, just a minute.

755
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:53,730
It's okay.

756
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:58,734
Hi.
Good morning.

757
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:00,769
Good morning.

758
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:03,706
I just wanted to--

759
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,908
I needed to talk to you.

760
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:09,378
Peggy, what's wrong?

761
00:45:11,214 --> 00:45:13,982
I...

762
00:45:14,016 --> 00:45:16,050
Abe got stabbed.

763
00:45:16,085 --> 00:45:18,620
My goodness. Is he okay?
What happened?

764
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:20,788
He's going to be fine.

765
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:23,758
But it's over.

766
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:27,928
We're done.

767
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:35,744
I'm sorry to hear that.

768
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,394
You are?

769
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:42,064
You'll find someone else.

770
00:45:42,098 --> 00:45:44,999
And whoever he is,
he's lucky to have you.

771
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,472
Thank you.

772
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:52,274
You ready to get to work?

773
00:45:52,308 --> 00:45:53,675
Excuse me?

774
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,478
It's Monday morning, Peggy.
Brand-new week.

775
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:05,519
Morning.
How was your weekend?

776
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,621
How'd it go with Fleischmann's?

777
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:10,224
They just called.
Full speed ahead.

778
00:46:10,258 --> 00:46:12,259
Good work.

779
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,662
