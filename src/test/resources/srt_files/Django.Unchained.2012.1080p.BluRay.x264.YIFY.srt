[gentle metallic rattling]

7
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,329
Whoa.

8
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,971
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

9
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,934
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

10
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,686
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

11
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,189
I mean you no harm.

12
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:36,194
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

13
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,197
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

14
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,699
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

15
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,534
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

16
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,536
Might that be you?

17
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,666
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

18
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

19
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,794
[snorting]

20
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,464
- What kinda doctor?
- [Schultz] Dentist.

21
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,424
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

22
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,386
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

23
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,138
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

24
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,642
- Speak English.
- [chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

26
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,481
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

27
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,067
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

28
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,694
Hello, you poor devils!

29
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,614
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

30
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,076
of the Carrucan plantation?

31
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,037
[man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

32
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,040
Who said that?

33
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,841
[Schultz lighting match]

34
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,630
What's your name?

35
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,678
Django.

36
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,598
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

37
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,685
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

38
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,315
Who are they?

39
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,360
Big John.

40
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,488
Ellis.

41
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,826
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

42
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,413
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

43
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,664
Not anymore.

44
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,794
Tell me...

45
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,172
...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

46
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,008
- would you recognize them?
- [man] Hey.

47
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,636
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like What?

48
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,346
Like that.

49
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,807
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

50
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,017
Speak English, goddamn it.

51
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,936
Everybody calm down.

52
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:18,815
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

53
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,984
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

54
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,154
[scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

55
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,448
Move it.

56
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:32,537
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

57
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,499
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

58
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,460
Last chance, fancy pants.

59
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,214
Oh, very well.

[screaming continues]

64
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,412
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

65
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,497
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

66
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,958
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

67
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,545
You goddamn son of a bitch!

68
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,506
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

69
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,383
And you killed Ace!

70
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,219
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

71
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,222
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

72
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,350
...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

73
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,395
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

74
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,106
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

75
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,610
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

76
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,778
[screaming resumes]

77
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,075
- [man] God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

78
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,954
...if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

79
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,332
Yeah.

80
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,791
Sold American!

81
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,921
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

82
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,845
That iron is nasty business.

83
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,186
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

84
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,814
Thank you. Django?

85
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,858
Get up on that horse.

86
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,818
Also, if I were you,

87
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,989
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

88
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,007
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

89
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,518
[screaming]

90
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:05,606
Goddamn it! Oh!
[moaning]

91
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:12,446
One hundred... ten... 20...

92
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,448
...and five...

93
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,867
...for young Django here.

94
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,203
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

95
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,872
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

96
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,545
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

97
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,297
Do you have one?

98
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,383
- You go to hell, dentist.
- [scoffs]

99
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,552
I thought not.

100
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:38,222
No worries. I come prepared.

101
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,145
Thank you.

102
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,898
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

103
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,405
[nickering]

104
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,245
Whoa.

105
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,878
Now, as to you poor devils.

106
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:14,091
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

107
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,094
you gentlemen have two choices.

108
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:22,391
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

109
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,477
then carry him to the nearest town.

110
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,230
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

111
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:34,070
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

112
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,781
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

113
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,493
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

114
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,745
Choice is yours.

115
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

116
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,461
the North Star is that one.

117
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:55,091
Ta-ta. [clucking]

118
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,984
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

119
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:17,446
- [lantern crashing]
- [chains rattling]

120
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,033
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

121
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,496
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

122
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,250
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

123
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,378
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

124
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,588
- I'll get you your freedom.
- [gun cocking]

125
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,509
- No. No, please...
- [gunshot echoing]

126
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,068
[dogs barking nearby]

127
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,179
[squeaking]

128
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,222
All right, now.

129
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,391
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

130
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,768
- [coughing]
- ...and then in the morning...

131
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,689
That's a nigger on a horse.

132
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,091
What's everybody staring at?

133
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,761
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

134
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,223
[goats bleating]

135
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,066
Whoa.

136
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,119
Good morning, innkeeper!

137
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,915
Two beers for two weary travelers.

138
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,833
It's still a bit early.

139
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,419
We won't be open for another hour.

140
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,421
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

141
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:45,010
[gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

142
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,263
Get that nigger outta here!

143
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:54,812
- [panting] Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

144
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:58,148
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

145
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,192
[man] Sheriff! Help!

146
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,986
Alas.

147
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,906
Now we must act as our own bartender.

148
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,077
Sit down, my boy.

149
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,631
- What kind of dentist are you?
- [chortles]

150
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,053
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

151
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,978
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

152
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,565
...bounty hunter.

153
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,990
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

154
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,742
No.

155
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,118
Well...

156
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:56,874
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

157
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,376
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

158
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,754
[tsking] Hat

159
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,051
Prost.

160
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,895
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

161
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,731
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

162
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,860
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

163
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,738
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

164
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,699
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

165
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,576
I truly have killed him,

166
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,746
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

167
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,249
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

168
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,877
What's a bounty?

169
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,132
It's like a reward.

170
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,678
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

171
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,721
Certain people, yeah.

172
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,014
Bad people?

173
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,143
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

174
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,604
Which brings me to you.

175
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,025
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

176
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,611
On one hand, I despise slavery.

177
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,906
On the other hand, I need your help.

178
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,451
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

179
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,996
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

180
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,374
work to my benefit.

181
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,212
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

182
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,136
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

183
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,019
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

184
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,025
However, at this endeavor,

185
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:52,322
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

186
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,452
But you do. Don't ya?

187
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,829
I know what they look like all right.

188
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,499
Good. So here's my agreement.

189
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,086
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

190
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,881
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

191
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,216
but I don't know where.

192
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,679
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

193
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:21,101
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

194
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,522
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

195
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,818
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

196
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,697
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

197
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,786
[scoffs]

198
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:46,960
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

199
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:54,176
- [overlapping chatter]
- All right, folks, calm down.

200
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,929
Go about your business.

201
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,098
These jokers will be gone soon.

202
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,481
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

203
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,901
And scare all these nice people.

204
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,738
You ain't got nothing better to do

205
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,116
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

206
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,536
and show your ass?

207
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,454
- [metal springing noise]
- [sheriff screaming]

208
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,582
- [crowd gasping]
- [groaning]

209
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,125
[woman screams]

210
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,798
- What'd you just do to our sheriff?
- [groaning]

211
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,134
- [yelling]
- [shot echoing]

212
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,511
[woman gasps]

213
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,638
[crowd screaming]

214
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,436
Now you can get the marshal.

215
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,274
[man] Marshal! Marshal!

216
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,693
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

217
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,069
After you.

218
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,742
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

219
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,787
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

220
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,123
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

221
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,625
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

222
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,753
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

223
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,923
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

224
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,260
You in the saloon!

225
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,763
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

226
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,642
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

227
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,979
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

228
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,106
and I mean right now.

229
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,652
[Schultz] Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

230
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,613
Yes, it is.

231
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,865
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

232
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,326
[Schultz]
Na wunderbar, marshal.

233
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,413
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

234
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,499
and just as you have instructed,

235
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,336
I am ready to step outside

236
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,590
with my hands raised above my head.

237
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,093
I trust as a representative

238
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,639
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

239
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:09,645
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

240
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,648
before I've had my day in court.

241
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,150
You mean like you did our sheriff.

242
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,110
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

243
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,613
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

244
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,452
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

245
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,042
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

246
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,212
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

247
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,216
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

248
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,220
They're a little tense out there.

249
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,848
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

250
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,851
- [doors squeaking open]
- Come ahead.

251
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,151
You unarmed?

252
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,028
[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.

253
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,116
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

254
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,243
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

255
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,745
as to the incident that just occurred?

256
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,541
- Go on.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,835
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

258
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,255
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

259
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,842
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

260
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,096
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

261
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:30,851
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

262
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,603
with a price on his head of $200.

263
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,732
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

264
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,233
The hell, you say!

265
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,446
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

266
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,782
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

267
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,452
sometime in the past two years?

268
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,370
Yeah.

269
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,957
[Schultz] I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

270
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,586
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

271
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:01,548
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

272
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:07,387
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

273
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,264
You're encouraged to wire him.

274
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,478
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

275
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,607
[guns uncocking]

276
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,573
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

277
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,659
[medium-tempo song plays]

278
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,750
I'll be damned.

279
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,365
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

280
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:14,079
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

281
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,291
What's your plan after that?

282
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:24,381
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

283
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,513
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

284
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,307
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

285
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,061
Oh, me and my wife do.

286
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:42,399
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

287
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,235
[man] Django.

288
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,488
Django, Django-

289
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,366
You got sand, Django.

290
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,952
Boy's got sand.

291
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,874
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

292
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,087
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

293
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,297
And the girl, too.

294
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,257
[groaning]

295
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:12,220
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

296
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,931
Both of 'em.

297
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,850
Separately.

298
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,645
And this one...

299
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,984
...you will sell him cheap.

300
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,446
In Greenville...

301
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,951
...there should be some sort
of a records office.

302
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,377
You know when she was sold...

303
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,798
...you know where she came from,

304
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,800
and you know her name.

305
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,136
What is her name?

306
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,971
Broomhilda.

307
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,809
- What?
- Broom-hilda.

308
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,937
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.

309
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,025
- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

310
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,319
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

311
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,030
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

312
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,324
She speak a little German, too.

313
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,243
- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

314
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,245
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

315
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,996
to speak German with.

316
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,167
Well, let me get this straight.

317
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:28,922
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

318
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,215
Yep.

319
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:37,013
They call me Hildi.

[rooster crowing nearby]

321
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:59,286
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

322
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,373
You'll be playing a character.

323
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,381
Hm?

324
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,508
No?

325
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:24,978
During the act, you can
never break character.

326
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,605
Do you understand?

327
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah. Don't break character.

328
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:37,157
And your character
is that of The Valet.

329
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,409
What that is?

330
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,704
That's a fancy word for servant.

331
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,122
- Valet?
- Hm-mm.

332

[chuckles]

333
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:50,128
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

334
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,382
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

335
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,508
But of course.

Whoa.

338
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,380
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

339
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,925
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,970
- I said niggers on horses...
- [Schultz] His name is Django.

341
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,932
He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.

342
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,560
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

343
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:53,233
My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

344
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,860
Allow me to unring this bell.

345
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:59,864
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

346
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,158
And these are our horses,

Mr. Bennett?

00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,751
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

350
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,880
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

351
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,966
to parley with you now.

352
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,096
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

353
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,725
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

354

to buy one of my nigger gals?

No appointment, no nothin'?

00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,606
Oh, I'm afraid so.

357
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,192
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

358
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,027
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

359
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,405
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

360
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,532
Now what you got to say about that?

361
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,787
Mr. Bennett.

362
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,207
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

363

I have 5,000 things I might say

yourself somethin' cool to drink.

Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

369
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,406
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

375
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,252
Betina, sugar, could you
take Django there

376
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,631
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

377
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,090
As you please, Big Daddy.

378
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:45,178
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

379
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,681
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

380
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,351
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

381
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,521
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

382
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,317
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

383
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,820
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

384
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,907
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

385
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,952
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

386
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,247
No. That's not what I said.

387
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,958
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

388
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,963
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:24,592
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

His mama work over at the lumberyard.

- That's the boy's name. Jerry!

- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

394
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,730
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

I ain't no slave?

- Yes, I's free.

[clicking]

475
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,297
Who were they?

476
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,009
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

477
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,677
Where's Ellis?

478
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,180
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

479
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,519
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

480
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,605
- Positive?
- I don't know.

481
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,024
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.

482
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,442
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

483
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,903
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

484
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,709
I'm positive he dead.

485
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:19,757
Django!

486
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,970
Everybody calm down.

487
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,389
We mean no one else any harm.

488
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,099
Who are you two jokers?

489
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,268
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

490
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,105
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

491
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:38,859
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

492
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,987
In my pocket is a warrant,

493
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:45,241
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

494
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:49,286
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

495
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:54,458
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

496
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,711
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

497
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:02,258
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

498
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,093
These are wanted men.

499
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,720
The law wants 'em for murder.

500
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:10,016
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

501
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,477
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

502
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,106
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

503
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:22,611
I realize passions are high,

504
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:26,824
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

505
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,368
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

506
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,456
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

507
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:41,213
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

508
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:44,425
Gimme.

509
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,318
Satisfied?

510
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,118
May I have that back, please?

511
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,835
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

512
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:24,924
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

513
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,471
[Schultz whistling indistinctly]

514
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:54,286
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

515
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:05,548

[men yelling, whooping]

518
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,578
Come on, men!

519
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,292
- [man 1] We're coming for you, nigger!
- [man 2] Hee-haw!

520
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,930
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

521
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,308
That's way too simple for these jokers.

522
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,686
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

523
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:05,900
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

524
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:10,988
Damn.

525
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,950
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

526
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,161
We ready or what?

527
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,705
[Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

528
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,249
- [fabric ripping]
- Oh... Oh, shit.

529
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,627
I just made it worse.

530
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,837
Who made this goddamn shit?

531
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,965
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

532
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,719
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

533
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,472
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

534
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,307
I coulda cut it better than this!

535
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,268
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

536
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,645
Not too good.

537
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:47,149
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

538
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,819
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

539
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,072
- Shit.
- [man] Yeah.

540
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,282
I just made mine worse.

541
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,243
Oh, God.

542
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,953
Anybody bring any extra bags?

543
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,081
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

544
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,874
I'm just askin'.

545
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,834
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

546
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,211
Oh, well, shitfire!

547
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:10,464
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

548
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,591
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

549
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,469
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

550
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,055
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

551
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:22,017
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

552
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,186
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

553
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,107
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

554
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,443
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

555
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,614
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

556
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,867
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

557
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,369
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

558
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:44,373
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

559
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,336
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

560
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,462
- Yeah.
- [mumbling agreements]

561
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,717
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

562
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:59,388
So how 'bout no bags this time,

563
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:04,560
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

564
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,729
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

565
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,232
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

566
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,401
But nobody can see.

567
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:13,652
So?

568
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,696
So it'd be nice to see.

569
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:20,617
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

570
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:26,165
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

571
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:29,126
- [overlapping shouts]
- [man] Sons of bitches!

572
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,628
I can't see shit!

573
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:35,424
[Big Daddy] There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

574
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:38,260
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

575
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,054
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

576
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,638
- What?
- They tricked us!

577
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,848
Well, where are they?

578
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,433
Auf Wiedersehen.

579
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:48,187
- [all shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

580
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:51,940
Oh! [chuckles]

581
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,150
Bull's-eye.

582
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:55,986
- [men yelling]
- [horses whinnying]

583
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,448
- [Django] Look at 'em run.
- [all shouting]

584
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,661
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

585
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,789
Goddamn it!

586
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,171
[Big Daddy] Goddamn it!

587
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,511
Would you care to?

588
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,144
Can't see shit outta this!

589
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,939
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

590
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,442
[Schultz]
Big Daddy's getting away.

591
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:36,860
I got him.

592
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:43,826
- [slow-motion impact sound]
- [Big Daddy grunting]

593
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:53,168
Got him.

594
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,009
[chuckles] The kid's a natural.

595
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:07,349
[animal yipping nearby]

596
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:15,482
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

597
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,901
Broomhilda is a German name.

598
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,779
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

599
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,198
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

600
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,952
Broomhilda is the name of a character

601
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,039
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

602
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,167
There's a story about Broomhilda?

603
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,043
Oh, yes, there is.

604
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:44,553
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

605
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,352
Would you like me to tell you?

606
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:59,860
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

607
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:05,782
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

608
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:10,037
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

609
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,455
What she do?

610
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,874
I can't exactly remember.

611
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,710
She disobeys him in some way.

612
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:20,047
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

613
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:21,840
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

614
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,258
It's a German legend,

615
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,220
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

616
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:30,432
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

617
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,189
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

618
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,986
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

619
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,576
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

620
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,246
Does a fella arise?

621
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,374
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

622
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,584
A fella named Siegfried.

623
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,294
Does Siegfried save her?

624
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,091
Quite spectacularly so.

625
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,263
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

626
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:14,142
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

627
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,812
And he walks through hellfire...

starting to realize that.

Greenville in a good conscience.

isn't the place for you to visit.

Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

636
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,695
But let me ask you a question.

637
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,622
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

638
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,459
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

639
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:22,628
What's not to like?

640
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,213
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

641
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,216
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

642
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,469
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

643
00:49:30,636 --> 00:49:32,596
but normally, that's a good thing.

644
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,599
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

645
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,768
What you mean "partner up"?

646
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:42,230
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

647
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,233
...I give you a third of my bounties.

648
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:50,364
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

649
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,450
I'll take you to Greenville myself

650
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,828
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

Why you care what happen to me?

652
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,546
Why you care if I find my wife?

653
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,090
Frankly...

654
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:12,260
...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

655

And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

- Thank you.
- Hm-mm.

01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,179
You want me to play a black slaver?

790
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:06,015
Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.

791
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:09,644
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...

792
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:12,438
...and, buddy,
that's pretty fuckin' low.

793
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,566
Then play him that way.

794
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:19,779
Give me your black slaver.

Dr. Schultz!

799
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:36,421
- Good to see you again!
- Mr. Moguy.

800
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,382
Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity

801
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:42,343
- for this appointment.
- Nonsense, it's my job.

802
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,346
So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.

803
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,932
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

804
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,768
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

805
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,895
Just call me Leo.

Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,693
[Schultz] How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

808
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,320
[Leo] Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11

809
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,281
when we went to
boarding school together.

810
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:06,534
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

811
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:09,704
One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

812
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,622
One could almost say youse a nigger.

813
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:13,916
What did you say?

814
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,836
- I said...
- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

815
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,799
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

816
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,968
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

817
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,928
[chuckles]
What civilized people aren't?

818
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:28,347
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

[speaks French]

820
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:35,146

There you go.

825
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:47,909
Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?

826
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,499
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

827
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,126
Quit stalling, now.

828

Answer the question.

829
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:04,717
The awful truth? I'm bored.

Keep fighting, niggers.

- Honor to meet you.

Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.

[Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

You find him a room
with a soft bed,

890
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:17,428
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:20,347
But you be ready to travel to Candyland

Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

Yessir.

A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

900
01:08:57,468 --> 01:08:59,553
I've heard tell about you.

901
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,057
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

902
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,351
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

903
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:09,730
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

904
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,109
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

905
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,490
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

906
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:21,867
No offense given...

907
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,911
...none taken.

908
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:25,788

direct your line of inquiry toward me.

One...

911
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,839
...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

912
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,842
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

913
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,844
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

914
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,846
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

915
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,098
Do not spare the rum.

916
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:47,768
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

917
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,645
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

918
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:54,942
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

919
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:59,613
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

920
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:02,199
...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

921
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,493
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

922
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,204
at above top-dollar market price.

923
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,915
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

924
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,459
it would be to discuss business.

925
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,631
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

926
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,134
We were discussin' my curiosity.

927
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:23,429
Thank you.

928
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:26,307
[Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

929
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:31,770
Sheba... you stay right there.

930
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,480
I know you didn't mean me.

931
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,735
- Prost!
- German.

932
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:42,448
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

933
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:44,658
I'm doing business with both y'all.

934
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:47,244
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

935
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:51,165
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

936
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,499
Hm.

937
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,793
So...

938
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,879
...Bright Boy...

939
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,006
...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

940
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,342
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

941
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,010
Not for top dollar.

942
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:07,222
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

943
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,516
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

944
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,936
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

945
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,063
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

946
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:18,192
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

947
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,655
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

948
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,577
Well, you won't sell your best.

949
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:31,163
You won't even sell your second best.

950
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:35,000
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

951
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:39,088
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

952
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,924
[chortles]
...who knows what could happen?

953
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,553
And what do you consider ridiculous?

954
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:51,642
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

955
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:55,437
How much would you say, Django?

956
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,526
Twelve thousand dollars.

957
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:02,903
[straw slurping]

958
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:09,076
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

959
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,161
but now you have my attention.

960
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:30,514
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

961
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,100
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

962
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:37,187
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

963
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,232
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

964
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,942
[Schultz]
Oh, thank you very much.

965
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,236
You can tie your horse up back there.

966

[Calvin] Django.

967
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:02,171
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

968
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:07,509
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

969
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:11,805
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

970
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:16,643
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

971
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,312
The exceptional nigger.

972
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:21,356
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

973
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:23,650
Sun is up.

974
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,695
Shining on all of us.

975
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,369
- [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.
- [Schultz] Thank you.

976
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:35,829
Quite an honor.

977
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,706
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,052
...more frequent.

982

Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

983
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,436
The name of the game is keep up,

- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

987
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,707
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

988
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:21,917
Are you kidding me?

989
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:24,086
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

990
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,797
Now take your hand off your pistol!

991
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,676
Butch, that means you too.

992

Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

He broke my collarbone!

For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

- [man] Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

998

Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

You wanna hold my hand?

Head 'em out!

You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

1007
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,646
No, sir.

1008
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,314
You want a boot heel in it?

1009
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:09,483
No, sir.

1010
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:12,694
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

1011
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:15,989
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

1012
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:17,699
Now move, nigger!

1013
01:16:18,242 --> 01:16:19,660
[horse snorting]

1014
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,954
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1015
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,997
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

1016
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:27,751
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1017
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:30,963
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he? [chuckles]

1018
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,464
Indeed.

1019
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:38,345
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1020
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:42,224
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1021
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:45,477
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1022
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:50,023
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1023
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,820
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1024
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:57,030
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1025
01:17:01,076 --> 01:17:03,662
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

1026
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:07,207
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

1027
01:17:07,374 --> 01:17:09,251
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1028
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,878
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1029
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:16,675
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

1030
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:18,802
You lose sight of why we're here.

1031
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:20,762
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

1032
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:23,432
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1033
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:28,562
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

1034
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:33,400
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

1035
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,570
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1036
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,281
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1037
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:45,704
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

1038
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,664
and he didn't bat a eye.

1039

You remember that?

1040
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,795
Yeah, of course I remember.

1041
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:57,424
What you said was that
this is my world...

1042
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,385
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

1043
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:04,264
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1044
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:11,104
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1045
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:14,649
...that was the general gist.

1046
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:16,318

Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

1054
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:29,474
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

[Calvin] Yes, you can.

You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

shut these goddamn dogs up?

- Quiet down, Marsha!

1059

Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,947
Hush up! Hey!

How long was he loose?

1068
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:29,659
[speech slurred]
A night. Day.

1069
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,453
Half the other night.

1070
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:34,122
How far he get off the property?

1071
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,999
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

1072
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,293
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

1073
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,836
Hm.

1074
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:44,424
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1075
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:46,218
One-a this new lot.

1076
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,096
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1077
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,766
[D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

- I can't...

1079
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:57,020
Now, no beggin'.

1080
01:20:57,187 --> 01:20:59,648
No playin' on my soft heart.

1081
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,654
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yessir.

1082
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:12,118
I done paid $500 for you.

1083
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:17,165
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

1084
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,709
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

1085
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:23,755
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

1086
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,633
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

1087
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,301
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1088
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:31,471
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

Yessir.

1090
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,394
Still, the fact remains:

1091
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:41,189
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1092
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:43,900
So what about my $500, huh?

1093
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,696
What about my $500?

1094
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,782
You gonna reimburse me?

1095
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:59,165
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1096
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,376
- [laughing]
- [Calvin] Huh?

1097
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:05,672
[laughter continues]

1098
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,384
I'll reimburse you!

1099
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:14,347
You Will?

1100
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,100
Yep.

1101
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:22,564
You'll pay $500

1102
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:26,192
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1103
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,485
No, he won't.

1104
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:31,823
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1105
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:34,701
Matter of fact, so am I.

1106
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:37,329
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1107
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:39,289
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1108
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,250
You heard him.

1109
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:55,180
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1110
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:59,017
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1111
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,770
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1112
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:05,482
That right.

1113
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,817
[Calvin] For that matter...

1114
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,695
...nor have I.

1115
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:17,952
Now...

1116
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,248
...seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1117
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:28,088
...you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1118
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:30,757
He's your nigger.

1119
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,596
Mr. Stonesipher?

1120
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:41,351
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1121
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:46,314
- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
- [barks echoing]

1122
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:49,984
Get 'im, get 'im!

1123
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,530
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1124
01:23:53,697 --> 01:23:55,115
Whoo-ee!

1125
01:24:00,328 --> 01:24:02,956
- [dogs snarling]
- [screaming]

1126
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,520
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1127
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:27,856
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1128
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:32,652
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1129
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,529
Hm.

1130
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,990
You are used to it?

1131
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:40,118
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1132
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:44,998
- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...

1133
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,791
...whenever you're ready.

1134
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:50,336
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1135
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:52,130
Let's get to it.

1136
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:57,719
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1137
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,347
Follow me.

1138
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,653
[snarling]

1139
01:25:21,493 --> 01:25:22,911
[clucking]

1140
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:24,287
[nickering]

1141
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:01,342
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1142
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:04,345
Stand up straight, now!

1143
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:06,806
Get up there.

1144
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,559
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1145
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,352
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1146
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,605
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1147
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:12,538
[indistinct chatter]

1148
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,874
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1149
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:17,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1150
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:20,838
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1151
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:24,342
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1152
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,886
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yessir. [laughs]

1153
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:30,598
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1154
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:34,686
- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
- [all chuckling]

1155
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:38,690
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1156
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:40,942
[laughing]

1157
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:45,571
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1158
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,407
Hey, Snowball?

1159
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:52,203
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1160
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:55,206
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1161
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,041
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1162
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,584
- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1163
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,837
- ...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1164
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:05,299
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1165
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:07,844
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1166
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,263
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1167
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:14,225
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1168
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:17,645
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1169
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:21,816
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1170
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:25,903
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1171
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,447
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1172
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:31,117
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1173
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:33,661
- You understand that?
- Yessir. Him I understand.

1174
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,496
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1175
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:38,291
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1176
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:40,793
Yessir. I understand.

1177
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,421
Well,good.
They're spendin' the night.

1178
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:45,715
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1179
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:48,551
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1180
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:50,928
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1181
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:53,681
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1182
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:56,142
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1183
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:58,352
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1184
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,855
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1185
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,274
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1186
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,651
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1187
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:07,737
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1188
01:30:07,904 --> 01:30:09,530
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1189
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,576
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1190
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,204
Go on, now.

1191
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,540
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1192
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:21,042
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1193
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:24,754
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1194
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:26,089
Now...

1195
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:30,927
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1196
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:34,180
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1197
01:30:34,347 --> 01:30:39,393
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1198
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,564
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1199
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:48,194
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1200
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,739
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1201
01:30:51,906 --> 01:30:54,033
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1202
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,243
You know where it is.

1203
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,161
Like you on a rope!

1204
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,124
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1205
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:04,836
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1206
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,798
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1207
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:09,924
Nigger gal?

1208
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:13,094
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1209
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,847
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1210
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:20,184
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1211
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:24,522
[laughs] You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1212
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:28,067
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1213
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:30,069
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1214
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:31,654
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1215
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:33,489
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1216
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:36,325
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1217
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:40,204
- What?
- [stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1218
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:42,874
[Calvin] What's she doin' there?

1219
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,793
[Stephen] What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1220
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,420
She bein' punished.

1221
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:49,922
- [Calvin] What she do?
- [Stephen] She run off again.

1222
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,758
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1223
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:55,428
- Two.
- When did she go?

1224
01:31:55,595 --> 01:31:58,097
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1225
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:00,933
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1226
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:05,354
[Stephen] Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1227
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,817
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1228
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:12,904
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1229
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,280
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1230
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:16,115
[Calvin]
How long she been in the box?

1231
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:19,076
[Stephen] How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1232
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,913
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1233
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,124
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1234
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:29,212
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1235
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,338
Hildi is my nigger.

1236
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,674
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1237
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:37,053
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1238
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,639
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1239
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,266
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1240
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:46,604
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1241
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:47,939
Yessir.

1242
01:32:49,232 --> 01:32:51,817
[Calvin] Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1243
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,363
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1244
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,906
[Lara Lee] Of course, darlin'.

1245
01:32:57,073 --> 01:33:01,953
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1246
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:04,997
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1247
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:09,669
[clucking]

1248
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:12,588
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1249
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:15,299
Cora! Come here!

1250
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,511
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1251
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:21,055
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1252
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:23,683
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1253
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:27,228
- Yessir.
- [soft guitar music plays]

1254
01:34:08,102 --> 01:34:09,979
[Hildi screams]

1255
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:13,524
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1256
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:16,110
[Hildi yelling]

1257
01:34:16,277 --> 01:34:19,822
[gasping screaming]

1258
01:34:21,115 --> 01:34:23,576
[sobbing]

1259
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:47,099
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1260
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:52,480
[slow-tempo song plays]

1261
01:34:56,025 --> 01:34:58,652
[woman sings in foreign language]

1262
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:15,521
[exhales]

1263
01:36:22,278 --> 01:36:23,737
Hello, ladies.

1264
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:27,283
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1265
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:33,914
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1266
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,501
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1267
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:40,880
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1268
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:43,841
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1269
01:36:44,008 --> 01:36:45,926
- [chuckles]
- [forced chuckle]

1270
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,096
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1271
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:54,226
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1272
01:36:57,563 --> 01:36:59,899
The doctor here speaks German.

1273
01:37:01,901 --> 01:37:03,861
And I've been informed you do as well?

1274
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,573
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1275
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,329
[Speaking German]

1276
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:15,748
Ha! [laughs]

1277
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:17,917
Astonishing.

1278
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,752
[Speaking German]

1279
01:37:24,882 --> 01:37:27,092
- And I shall bring you...
- [Schultz] Much obliged.

1280
01:37:36,602 --> 01:37:37,728
<i>Ja.</i>

1281
01:37:58,374 --> 01:37:59,959
[speaks German]

1282
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:02,586
Don't be afraid.

1283
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:43,168
Hm. Pardon.

1284
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,052
<i>Danke.</i>

1285
01:39:35,888 --> 01:39:37,514
[chuckling]

1286
01:40:20,307 --> 01:40:22,351
[repeats German phrase]

1287
01:40:37,491 --> 01:40:39,076
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1288
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,245
[gasping]

1289
01:40:43,664 --> 01:40:44,832
[moaning]

1290
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:50,963
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1291
01:40:52,548 --> 01:40:53,882
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1292
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:55,300
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1293
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:58,429
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1294
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:01,348
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1295
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:03,726
[laughs] That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1296
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:06,478
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1297
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:12,443
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1298
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:16,989
But the best three by far were Samson...

1299
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,950
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1300
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:23,454
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1301
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,206
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1302
01:41:26,373 --> 01:41:29,460
[chuckles] You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1303
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:32,212
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1304
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:34,381
[all laugh]

1305
01:41:35,883 --> 01:41:41,221
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1306
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:45,100
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1307
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:49,021
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1308
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:51,774
Samson's the champion.

1309
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,734
Them other two pretty good.

1310
01:41:55,027 --> 01:41:56,528
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1311
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:57,821
It's all right.

1312
01:41:57,988 --> 01:42:00,073
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1313
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,619
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1314
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:08,081
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1315
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,333
Is that right?

1316
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,587
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1317
01:42:13,754 --> 01:42:14,713
Hm.

1318
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,341
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1319
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:21,303
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1320
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:24,556
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1321
01:42:24,723 --> 01:42:27,476
- A sense of Showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1322
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:30,854
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1323
01:42:31,021 --> 01:42:32,648
[all chuckling]

1324
01:42:32,815 --> 01:42:34,191
The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1325
01:42:34,358 --> 01:42:35,359
More like Nigger-les.

1326
01:42:35,526 --> 01:42:37,653
[laughing]

1327
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:43,200
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1328
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,495
...'the right nigger."'

1329
01:42:46,662 --> 01:42:50,958
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1330
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:53,836
But is he right as rain?

1331
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,505
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1332
01:42:56,672 --> 01:43:00,467
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1333
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:02,553
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1334
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,471
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1335
01:43:04,638 --> 01:43:05,639
Nobody.

1336
01:43:05,806 --> 01:43:07,641
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1337
01:43:07,808 --> 01:43:09,184
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1338
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,353
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1339
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,729
Hm-mm.

1340
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:17,109
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1341
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,319
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1342
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:23,448
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1343
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:26,159
In other words, first thing is first.

1344
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,786
First thing's first.

1345
01:43:32,624 --> 01:43:34,251
[whispers in German]

1346
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,839
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1347
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:40,883
Famously.

1348
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,303
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1349
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:47,806
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1350
01:43:47,973 --> 01:43:49,808
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1351
01:43:49,975 --> 01:43:52,060
[laughing]

1352
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:54,271
Two weeks in Boston!

1353
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:57,232
- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
- [coughing]

1354
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,109
[Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!

1355
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:04,489
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1356
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,744
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1357
01:44:08,911 --> 01:44:10,787
[Calvin] Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1358
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:12,289
You might-a caught yourself

1359
01:44:12,456 --> 01:44:13,707
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1360
01:44:13,874 --> 01:44:15,959
[Calvin] Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1361
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:18,128
- [Stephen] Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1362
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:19,922
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1363
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:23,050
Yessir, you stuck. [laughs]

1364
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:24,760
[Lara Lee] I don't know, doctor.

1365
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:27,179
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1366
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:31,850
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1367
01:44:32,976 --> 01:44:34,102
[Lara Lee giggles]

1368
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:36,730
Well, naturally.

1369
01:44:36,897 --> 01:44:40,525
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1370
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:43,487
- not the plucked chicken.
- [all chuckle]

1371
01:44:43,654 --> 01:44:46,156
[Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1372
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:48,241
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1373
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:49,451
[Cora] You got to clean these dishes,

1374
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:51,620
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1375
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:53,997
You know that nigger, don't you?

1376
01:44:54,915 --> 01:44:56,208
- Who?
- "Who?"

1377
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:59,461
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1378
01:45:01,213 --> 01:45:03,215
At the table?

1379
01:45:03,382 --> 01:45:04,633
I don't know him.

1380
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,844
- You don't know him.
- No.

1381
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:10,847
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1382
01:45:12,933 --> 01:45:14,017
[chuckles]

1383
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:17,938
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1384
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,360
OK.

1385
01:45:24,611 --> 01:45:27,739
Yeah. If you say so.

1386
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:37,624
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1387
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:44,172
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1388
01:45:44,339 --> 01:45:46,675
What would your price be?

1389
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,802
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1390
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:52,431
...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1391
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:56,643
...9,000. Maybe.

1392
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:03,692
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1393
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:06,028
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1394
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,154
Sure wasn't.

1395
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,031
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1396
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:11,366
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1397
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:13,952
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1398
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:15,746
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1399
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:18,874
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1400
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:23,295
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1401
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,924
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1402
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:30,927
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1403
01:46:35,599 --> 01:46:38,935
[deep inhale]

1404
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:43,190
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1405
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:44,649
[chuckles]

1406
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:49,529
[slamming table] Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1407
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:53,033
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- [banging table] Hooray, doctor.

1408
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,327
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1409
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:59,039
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1410
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:02,375
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1411
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,336
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1412
01:47:04,503 --> 01:47:07,589
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1413
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:10,801
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1414
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:11,968
Hm-mm.

1415
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,804
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1416
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:16,598
- by a physician of my choosing.
- [Calvin] Naturally.

1417
01:47:16,765 --> 01:47:21,478
So, say I return in about...

1418
01:47:23,647 --> 01:47:25,941
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1419
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:27,359
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1420
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:29,569
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1421
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:32,697
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1422
01:47:33,532 --> 01:47:36,576
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1423
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:38,495
Gentlemen...

1424
01:47:39,496 --> 01:47:41,498
...may I propose a toast.

1425
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:48,755
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1426
01:47:48,922 --> 01:47:51,591
- [all chuckling]
- To The Black Hercules.

1427
01:47:51,758 --> 01:47:53,135
[Stephen] The Black Hercules.

1428
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,719
[speaks low]
To The Black Hercules.

1429
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:58,723
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass. [chuckles]

1430
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,308
Hm.

1431
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:03,728
Hildi, top my drink off.

1432
01:48:06,815 --> 01:48:11,862
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1433
01:48:12,028 --> 01:48:15,240
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1434
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:18,160
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1435
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:21,079
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1436
01:48:21,246 --> 01:48:22,581
through a bramble bush.

1437
01:48:22,747 --> 01:48:25,834
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1438
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:27,586
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1439
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:28,920
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1440
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,547
[Hildi] No, sir.

1441
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:32,048
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1442
01:48:32,215 --> 01:48:35,886
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1443
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:39,306
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1444
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:41,600
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1445
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:44,811
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1446
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:46,730
No, we just talked and...

1447
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:49,274
[Calvin] Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1448
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:51,234
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1449
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:53,445
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1450
01:48:53,612 --> 01:48:56,698
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1451
01:48:56,865 --> 01:48:58,825
- Go on.
- [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin.

1452
01:48:58,992 --> 01:49:01,369
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1453
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:04,456
[Calvin] But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1454
01:49:04,623 --> 01:49:07,626
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1455
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,378
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1456
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:14,132
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1457
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:16,468
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1458
01:49:16,635 --> 01:49:18,553
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1459
01:49:18,762 --> 01:49:19,846
- [Stephen] Sure would.
- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.

1460
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:22,265
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1461
01:49:23,058 --> 01:49:26,102
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1462
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:30,190
- [exhales]
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1463
01:49:30,357 --> 01:49:33,026
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1464
01:49:34,236 --> 01:49:36,029
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1465
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,954
[Lara Lee]
Cora, come get this girl!

1466
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,789
[approaching footsteps]

1467
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:50,627
- [Lara Lee] She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. [gasps] Oh!

1468
01:49:50,794 --> 01:49:53,255
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1469
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:54,756
Come on in here.

1470
01:50:01,263 --> 01:50:05,058
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1471
01:50:05,225 --> 01:50:07,185
You say you ain't know him.

1472
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:09,396
Huh?

1473
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:15,151
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1474
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,698
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1475
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:23,493
Mr. Stephen...

1476
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:25,495
...I don't.

1477
01:50:25,662 --> 01:50:28,164
Why is you lying to me?

1478
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:31,876
I ain't.

1479
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:34,546
Then why is you crying?

1480
01:50:34,713 --> 01:50:36,881
You scarin' me.

1481
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:40,969
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1482
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,724
[Schultz] To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1483
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:49,019
was positively soul-enriching.

1484
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:52,063
[Calvin] Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1485
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:55,066
You stay right here.

1486
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:04,909
[Schultz] You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1487
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:07,912
Why,yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1488
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:15,879
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1489
01:51:16,046 --> 01:51:17,422
I'm all ears.

1490
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:19,299
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1491
01:51:19,924 --> 01:51:21,509
- Monsieur Candie...
- [Calvin] Stephen!

1492
01:51:22,552 --> 01:51:25,013
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1493
01:51:26,139 --> 01:51:28,266
[Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1494
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:31,144
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1495
01:51:31,311 --> 01:51:32,437
Excuse him.

1496
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:36,358
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1497
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:38,443
You mean get up out of my chair?

1498
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:41,946
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1499
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:45,950
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1500
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:48,745
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1501
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:50,789
We're having white cake!

1502
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,291
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1503
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:57,796
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1504
01:51:57,962 --> 01:51:59,756
[whispers] Meet me in the library.

1505
01:51:59,923 --> 01:52:03,009
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1506
01:52:03,176 --> 01:52:05,053
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1507
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:10,225
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1508
01:52:10,392 --> 01:52:11,559
Yessir.

1509
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:16,147
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1510
01:52:16,314 --> 01:52:18,066
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1511
01:52:18,233 --> 01:52:21,861
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1512
01:52:22,028 --> 01:52:23,321
[all chuckle]

1513
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:26,658
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1514
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,624
[Calvin] You may clear
the dinner service.

1515
01:52:36,084 --> 01:52:39,462
[Cora] You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1516
01:52:39,629 --> 01:52:45,051
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1517
01:52:45,218 --> 01:52:47,887
[chuckles] The circus?

1518
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:49,556
[fire crackling]

1519
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:56,146
What is the matter?

1520
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:06,489
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1521
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:10,201
- They wants that girl.
- [chuckling]

1522
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:13,121
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1523
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:16,458
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1524
01:53:16,624 --> 01:53:20,295
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1525
01:53:20,462 --> 01:53:22,630
They here for that girl.

1526
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:25,425
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1527
01:53:25,592 --> 01:53:29,220
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1528
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,515
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1529
01:53:32,682 --> 01:53:35,059
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1530
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:37,687
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1531
01:53:37,854 --> 01:53:40,106
But he's just about to buy

1532
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:43,485
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1533
01:53:43,651 --> 01:53:46,654
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1534
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:54,078
Where you gettin' all this?

1535
01:53:55,205 --> 01:53:56,998
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1536
01:53:57,165 --> 01:53:59,667
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1537
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:04,130
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1538
01:54:04,297 --> 01:54:06,132
She probably his wife.

1539
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:09,093
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1540
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:12,347
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1541
01:54:14,933 --> 01:54:16,893
If she's who they want...

1542
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:21,773
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1543
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:25,443
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1544
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:31,074
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1545
01:54:33,785 --> 01:54:35,453
Yes, it did.

1546
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:40,416
His wife, huh?

1547
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:48,007
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1548
01:54:48,174 --> 01:54:49,592
[chuckles]

1549
01:54:51,302 --> 01:54:53,304
Those lying...

1550
01:54:54,138 --> 01:55:00,144
...goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1551
01:55:02,355 --> 01:55:03,523
Sons of bitches!

1552
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:08,945
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1553
01:55:10,196 --> 01:55:11,656
Oh, there you are.

1554
01:55:11,823 --> 01:55:14,617
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1555
01:55:14,784 --> 01:55:16,244
[all chuckling]

1556
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:18,580
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1557
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:21,833
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1558
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,044
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1559
01:55:25,211 --> 01:55:26,296
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1560
01:55:26,462 --> 01:55:30,341
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1561
01:55:30,508 --> 01:55:32,760
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1562
01:55:46,024 --> 01:55:49,736
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1563
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:54,699
Apropos, before your exit,

1564
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:58,870
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1565
01:55:59,037 --> 01:56:01,956
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1566
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:04,250
And we will again. In a moment.

1567
01:56:20,725 --> 01:56:22,769
Who's your little friend?

1568
01:56:25,146 --> 01:56:26,189
[clearing throat]

1569
01:56:27,732 --> 01:56:29,233
This is Ben.

1570
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:35,573
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1571
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:38,159
And I do mean a long damn time.

1572
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:42,997
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1573
01:56:43,873 --> 01:56:45,917
...and my daddy's daddy.

1574
01:56:46,084 --> 01:56:48,670
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1575
01:56:51,506 --> 01:56:53,174
...Old Ben took care of me.

1576
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,555
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1577
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:05,603
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1578
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:12,527
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1579
01:57:13,778 --> 01:57:17,573
...surrounded by black faces.

1580
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,953
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1581
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:25,289
I only had one question:

1582
01:57:29,001 --> 01:57:31,462
- Why don't they kill us?
- [laughs]

1583
01:57:34,465 --> 01:57:39,637
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1584
01:57:39,804 --> 01:57:44,726
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1585
01:57:44,892 --> 01:57:50,022
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1586
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:53,609
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1587
01:57:56,154 --> 01:57:57,655
But he never did.

1588
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,825
Why not?

1589
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:06,998
You see, the science of phrenology

1590
01:58:07,165 --> 01:58:12,253
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1591
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,800
In the skull of the African here,

1592
01:58:17,967 --> 01:58:20,094
the area associated
with submissiveness

1593
01:58:20,261 --> 01:58:25,767
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1594
01:58:26,851 --> 01:58:28,519
[sawing]

1595
01:58:41,282 --> 01:58:43,242
If you examine...

1596
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:46,788
...this piece of skull here...

1597
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:56,672
...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1598
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:03,971
Here, here and here.

1599
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,389
Now...

1600
01:59:05,556 --> 01:59:10,561
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1601
01:59:10,728 --> 01:59:13,231
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1602
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:16,734
most associated with... creativity.

1603
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:19,237
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1604
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:21,989
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1605
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,450
unburdened by genius,

1606
01:59:24,617 --> 01:59:28,788
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1607
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:31,249
...servility.

1608
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:34,001
Now, Bright Boy...

1609
01:59:34,919 --> 01:59:37,088
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1610
01:59:39,549 --> 01:59:41,634
But if I took this hammer here...

1611
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,097
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1612
01:59:47,098 --> 01:59:52,436
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1613
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:55,147
...as Old Ben.

1614
01:59:56,274 --> 01:59:59,861
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1615
02:00:00,027 --> 02:00:02,989
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1616
02:00:03,155 --> 02:00:06,409
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1617
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:10,621
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1618
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:13,124
but that you can believe!

1619
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:16,085
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1620
02:00:16,252 --> 02:00:18,629
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1621
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:25,761
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1622
02:00:30,308 --> 02:00:31,684
Where were we?

1623
02:00:36,147 --> 02:00:37,565
Jackass.

1624
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:43,070
Ah, yes.

1625
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,990
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1626
02:00:46,157 --> 02:00:48,618
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1627
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,161
Am I right?

1628
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:55,499
Right.

1629
02:00:57,919 --> 02:00:59,420
Bring out Hildi!

1630
02:01:02,173 --> 02:01:03,716
Get over there yonder.

1631
02:01:05,176 --> 02:01:07,428
- [screams]
- Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1632
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:08,846
[Stephen] Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1633
02:01:09,013 --> 02:01:10,556
[Calvin] Now shut your mouth!

1634
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:17,438
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1635
02:01:17,605 --> 02:01:20,358
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1636
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:24,862
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1637
02:01:25,029 --> 02:01:28,074
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1638
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,203
To which you said, "$12,000."

1639
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:34,747
- [yells]
- Now, considering y'all

1640
02:01:34,914 --> 02:01:36,874
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1641
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:41,003
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1642
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,589
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1643
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:49,720
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1644
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:53,641
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1645
02:01:53,808 --> 02:01:59,438
the price is $12,000.

1646
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:03,401
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1647
02:02:05,653 --> 02:02:07,196
Yes, I do, doctor.

1648
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,033
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1649
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,745
Broomhilda here is my property.

1650
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:20,042
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1651
02:02:21,127 --> 02:02:23,421
And if y'all think my price...

1652
02:02:24,088 --> 02:02:26,799
...for this nigger here
is too steep...

1653
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:30,428
- [grunts]
- ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1654
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:37,476
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1655
02:02:37,643 --> 02:02:39,770
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1656
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:44,442
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1657
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,779
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1658
02:02:48,946 --> 02:02:50,281
- [Hildi whimpering]
- What's it gonna be?

1659
02:02:50,448 --> 02:02:54,326
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1660
02:02:55,536 --> 02:02:56,871
Yes, you may.

1661
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:11,844
That 12.

1662
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,767
- Sold!
- [screaming]

1663
02:03:17,933 --> 02:03:20,478
To the man with the exceptional beard

1664
02:03:20,644 --> 02:03:23,981
and his unexceptional nigger.

1665
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,114
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1666
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:35,951
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1667
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:37,870
$12,000.

1668
02:03:40,998 --> 02:03:43,167
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1669
02:03:44,043 --> 02:03:45,795
Now, gentlemen...

1670
02:03:47,004 --> 02:03:48,881
...if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1671
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,301
...we will be serving white cake.

1672
02:03:53,177 --> 02:03:54,804
[Beethoven's "Fur Elise"
played on harp]

1673
02:04:52,111 --> 02:04:52,778
- [screaming]
- [dogs snarling]

1674
02:05:08,169 --> 02:05:09,628
[screaming]

1675
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:21,974
Well done, Calvin.

1676
02:05:24,476 --> 02:05:27,354
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1677
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:32,484
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1678
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:37,823
[Stephen] Doctor!

1679
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:40,618
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1680
02:05:40,784 --> 02:05:41,952
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1681
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:43,454
Let it be.

1682
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:45,539
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1683
02:05:45,706 --> 02:05:47,124
I'll handle this.

1684
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:14,276
White cake?

1685
02:06:15,277 --> 02:06:17,529
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1686
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:19,782
Hm.

1687
02:06:24,536 --> 02:06:25,537
[Calvin chuckles softly]

1688
02:06:27,498 --> 02:06:30,209
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1689
02:06:30,918 --> 02:06:35,673
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1690
02:06:35,839 --> 02:06:37,675
D'Artagnan.

1691
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:42,263
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1692
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:43,889
Come again?

1693
02:06:46,976 --> 02:06:51,021
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote The <i>Three</i> Musketeers.

1694
02:06:51,188 --> 02:06:52,856
Yes, of course, doctor.

1695
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:54,566
I figured you must be an admirer.

1696
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:59,154
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1697
02:06:59,321 --> 02:07:03,033
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1698
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,160
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1699
02:07:07,204 --> 02:07:09,039
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1700
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:16,422
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1701
02:07:18,716 --> 02:07:20,509
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1702
02:07:22,386 --> 02:07:24,596
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1703
02:07:28,434 --> 02:07:31,228
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1704
02:07:31,395 --> 02:07:33,063
- May I?
- Of course.

1705
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,606
Thank you.

1706
02:07:36,734 --> 02:07:39,695
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1707
02:07:39,862 --> 02:07:42,031
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1708
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:44,408
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1709
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:48,579
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1710
02:08:09,892 --> 02:08:11,101
Thank you.

1711
02:08:14,688 --> 02:08:16,982
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1712
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:21,612
...consider yourself a free woman.

1713
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,501
Mr. Candie...

1714
02:08:37,461 --> 02:08:41,256
...normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1715
02:08:41,423 --> 02:08:45,886
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1716
02:08:46,053 --> 02:08:48,389
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1717
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:53,227
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1718
02:08:57,106 --> 02:08:58,399
Let's go.

1719
02:08:59,358 --> 02:09:00,901
Come on.

1720
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:04,696
One more moment, doctor!

1721
02:09:06,573 --> 02:09:07,616
What?

1722
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,456
It's a custom here in the South...

1723
02:09:14,957 --> 02:09:20,337
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1724
02:09:21,171 --> 02:09:23,215
It implies good faith.

1725
02:09:23,382 --> 02:09:26,427
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1726
02:09:26,593 --> 02:09:28,887
...in my house, doctor.

1727
02:09:29,763 --> 02:09:32,683
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1728
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,852
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1729
02:09:35,018 --> 02:09:38,313
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1730
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:41,942
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1731
02:09:42,109 --> 02:09:43,902
No, I don't.

1732
02:09:45,571 --> 02:09:50,784
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1733
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,914
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1734
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,709
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1735
02:09:59,585 --> 02:10:02,421
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1736
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,884
...you don't shake my hand.

1737
02:10:07,843 --> 02:10:13,515
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1738
02:10:13,682 --> 02:10:15,434
I don't think so.

1739
02:10:16,435 --> 02:10:17,603
Mr. Pooch?

1740
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:24,151
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1741
02:10:24,318 --> 02:10:26,069
you cut her ass down.

02:10:53,096 --> 02:10:54,681
I insist.

1745
02:10:55,766 --> 02:10:58,435
If you insist.

Well, more than most.

1856
02:20:50,276 --> 02:20:56,116
Then I says: "Shitfire.

1857
02:20:56,282 --> 02:21:00,286
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1858
02:21:01,329 --> 02:21:04,040
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1859
02:21:04,207 --> 02:21:07,502
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1860
02:21:07,669 --> 02:21:10,880
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1861
02:21:11,047 --> 02:21:13,174
We do that shit all the time.

1862
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:19,222
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1863
02:21:20,348 --> 02:21:23,059
Lo and behold,

1864
02:21:23,226 --> 02:21:28,064
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1865
02:21:28,231 --> 02:21:31,693
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1866
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:39,200
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1867
02:21:39,367 --> 02:21:42,912
henceforth, till the day you die,

1868
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:46,207
all day, every day,

1869
02:21:46,374 --> 02:21:49,210
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1870
02:21:49,377 --> 02:21:54,007
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1871
02:21:54,174 --> 02:21:58,761
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1872
02:21:58,928 --> 02:22:01,848
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1873
02:22:02,015 --> 02:22:04,434
and say, "Get to work!"

1874
02:22:04,601 --> 02:22:07,020
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1875
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,522
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1876
02:22:09,689 --> 02:22:13,359
Oh, they does that real good.

1877
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:15,111
They gonna work ya.

1878
02:22:15,278 --> 02:22:20,283
All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1879
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:23,036
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1880
02:22:23,203 --> 02:22:25,622
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1881
02:22:25,788 --> 02:22:31,169
And that will be the story of you,
Django.

1882
02:22:32,712 --> 02:22:34,631
[slow-tempo song plays]

1883
02:23:10,208 --> 02:23:12,669
[man, Australian accent] And what's
the golden rule, Frankie, eh?

1884
02:23:12,835 --> 02:23:14,963
You don't root abos.

1885
02:23:19,717 --> 02:23:21,177
Hey, white boy.

1886
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:24,889
I said, hey, white boy.

1887
02:23:25,056 --> 02:23:28,142
Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.

1888
02:23:28,309 --> 02:23:30,603
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1889
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:31,938
Do what, now?

1890
02:23:32,105 --> 02:23:37,902
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
11,500, actually.

1891
02:23:38,069 --> 02:23:40,029
What the fuck are you talking about?

1892
02:23:40,196 --> 02:23:44,867
Back there at that plantation,
Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1893
02:23:45,034 --> 02:23:47,870
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1894
02:23:48,830 --> 02:23:50,540
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1895
02:23:50,707 --> 02:23:54,919
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1896
02:23:55,086 --> 02:23:56,504
You can't steal it.

1897
02:23:56,671 --> 02:23:58,339
You got to earn it, white boy.

1898
02:23:59,299 --> 02:24:01,301
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1899
02:24:01,467 --> 02:24:04,679
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

1900
02:24:04,846 --> 02:24:06,973
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1901
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:09,475
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1902
02:24:09,642 --> 02:24:11,102
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1903
02:24:11,269 --> 02:24:14,564
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1904
02:24:14,731 --> 02:24:16,316
the Bacall Gang.

1905
02:24:16,482 --> 02:24:19,736
There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1906
02:24:19,902 --> 02:24:23,239
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

1907
02:24:23,406 --> 02:24:26,659
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1908
02:24:26,826 --> 02:24:29,537
and Crazy Craig Koons.

1909
02:24:29,704 --> 02:24:31,122
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

1910
02:24:31,289 --> 02:24:33,416
they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off.

1911
02:24:33,583 --> 02:24:37,253
You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1912
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:38,963
But it ain't got to be that way.

1913
02:24:39,130 --> 02:24:42,425
You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.

1914
02:24:42,592 --> 02:24:43,676
What'd these jokers do again?

1915
02:24:43,843 --> 02:24:47,347
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

1916
02:24:47,513 --> 02:24:50,767
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

1917
02:24:51,851 --> 02:24:54,854
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1918
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:56,189
Get it out.

1919
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:03,196
[man 1] "Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."

1920
02:25:03,363 --> 02:25:04,697
- [man 2] But you're a slave.
- [man 1] "For murder..."

1921
02:25:04,864 --> 02:25:07,367
- [Django] I ain't no goddamn slave.
- [man 1] "...and stagecoach robbery."

1922
02:25:07,533 --> 02:25:08,785
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1923
02:25:09,118 --> 02:25:10,578
- [man 1] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?

1924
02:25:10,745 --> 02:25:13,539
- [man 2] That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.

1925
02:25:14,957 --> 02:25:17,543
Yesterday, as a free man,

1926
02:25:17,710 --> 02:25:22,256
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1927
02:25:22,423 --> 02:25:23,966
Dr. King Schultz.

1928
02:25:24,133 --> 02:25:28,888
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1929
02:25:29,055 --> 02:25:31,974
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1930
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:35,645
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1931
02:25:35,812 --> 02:25:39,148
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1932
02:25:39,315 --> 02:25:43,486
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1933
02:25:45,488 --> 02:25:47,407
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1934
02:25:47,573 --> 02:25:50,368
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1935
02:25:50,535 --> 02:25:53,871
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1936
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:57,333
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1937
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,752
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1938
02:25:59,919 --> 02:26:01,671
[man 1] What's the deal?

1939
02:26:01,838 --> 02:26:05,299
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1940
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:08,344
No,no,no,no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1941
02:26:08,511 --> 02:26:12,014
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1942
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:16,686
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1943
02:26:16,853 --> 02:26:18,729
This is a real handbill.

1944
02:26:18,896 --> 02:26:19,939
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1945
02:26:20,106 --> 02:26:22,191
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1946
02:26:22,358 --> 02:26:28,281
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1947
02:26:32,952 --> 02:26:35,746
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1948
02:26:42,086 --> 02:26:46,048
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1949
02:26:47,258 --> 02:26:49,886
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1950
02:26:50,595 --> 02:26:52,430
Is he a Candyland slave,

1951
02:26:52,597 --> 02:26:56,392
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1952
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:00,229
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1953
02:27:00,396 --> 02:27:02,940
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1954
02:27:03,608 --> 02:27:07,778
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1955
02:27:07,945 --> 02:27:09,447
He weren't no slave.

1956
02:27:09,614 --> 02:27:13,451
- You fuckin' sure about that?
- Damn sure.

1957
02:27:17,413 --> 02:27:20,958
- What happened over in Candyland?
- Bunch-a shootin'.

1958
02:27:21,125 --> 02:27:22,919
Massa got shot.

1959
02:27:23,085 --> 02:27:25,213
- Who shot him?
- The German.

1960
02:27:25,379 --> 02:27:26,422
Why'd he do that?

1961
02:27:27,089 --> 02:27:30,551
Nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1962
02:27:30,718 --> 02:27:33,804
- Well, what were they?
- Bounty hunters.

1963
02:27:34,889 --> 02:27:38,226
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

1964
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:42,480
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1965
02:27:43,981 --> 02:27:46,817
- I got one more condition.
- What's that?

1966
02:27:46,984 --> 02:27:50,780
When we get there, when time come...

1967
02:27:52,156 --> 02:27:55,117
- ...you let me help you kill 'em.
- Hey... [laughs]

1968
02:27:55,284 --> 02:27:56,953
...you're a funny bugger.

1969
02:27:57,119 --> 02:27:59,497
- Cut him loose.
- Yeah, yeah.

1970
02:27:59,664 --> 02:28:01,457
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1971
02:28:01,624 --> 02:28:03,793
[mimics accent]
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1972
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:05,670
Hey! [laughs]

1973
02:28:05,836 --> 02:28:07,171
You're all right for a black fella.

1974
02:28:07,338 --> 02:28:08,589
Oh, yeah.

1975
02:28:13,803 --> 02:28:15,471
There we go.
There you go, mate.

1976
02:28:15,638 --> 02:28:17,014
Yeah.

1977
02:28:17,181 --> 02:28:19,850
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

1978
02:28:20,017 --> 02:28:21,978
What them saddlebags got in 'em?

1979
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:24,021
- Dynamite.
- No. I ain't ridin' no horse

1980
02:28:24,188 --> 02:28:26,107
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1981
02:28:26,274 --> 02:28:28,150
I can understand that.

1982
02:28:28,317 --> 02:28:31,153
Frankie, why don't you
take them sticks off that horse

1983
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:33,155
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1984
02:28:34,782 --> 02:28:36,951
A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with.

1985
02:28:37,118 --> 02:28:39,161
[laughs]

1986
02:28:48,504 --> 02:28:51,173
Now, Floyd, you got that
rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?

1987
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:52,341
Yeah, right.

1988
02:28:52,508 --> 02:28:55,052
Why don't you give him
your gun and gun belt?

1989
02:28:55,219 --> 02:28:56,512
Righto.

1990
02:28:56,679 --> 02:28:59,807
Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing,
all right?

1991
02:28:59,974 --> 02:29:02,893
I've just had the sights fixed
and they're perfect.

1992
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:04,186
Oh, that's good to know.

1995
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:38,280
Throw me up that dynamite.

- [man] Jake!
- Yeah?

1999
02:32:10,498 --> 02:32:13,876
Get out there and see what's
wrong with them goddamn dogs!
