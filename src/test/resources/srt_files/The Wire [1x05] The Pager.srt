1
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,441
...the big fat morning show.

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,976
Now, you wanna play
the brand new big fat game:

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,875
big fat match game, call us now....

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,075
Hello?

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,245
Hello?

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,617
Who was that?

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,222
-They hung up without saying.
-They hung up without saying?

8
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,095
What you care?

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,693
You never use the damn phone
in here no how.

10
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,652
What's up, baby?

11
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:30,483
I need you to get
them phone lines up out that house.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,581
Out of the apartment? Why?

13
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,126
I'm saying, what Chantay gonna say...

14
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,492
about not havin' no line in her own place?

15
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,859
All right. Got you.

16
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:44,227
What's up, baby, you got a problem?

17
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,168
-Good.
-I'm just sayin' though, man...

18
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,399
it seem we just goin' past careful, man...

19
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,805
with all of this, man.

20
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,208
Like we buggin' out or something.
You know, like we paranoid and shit.

21
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:03,582
Naw, I don't wanna use this phone.
We used this phone yesterday.

22
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:07,284
What you blowing out your mouth for, man?

23
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,553
You act like....

24
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,755
Ain't nobody out to get me, man.
I got no motherfuckin' enemies.

25
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:12,920
Naw, man.

26
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,434
We all right.

27
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,890
All right, this gonna be so easy...

28
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,903
them Eastside chumps,
they ain't nothing like Avon's people.

29
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,870
Watch, y'all gonna see.

30
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,938
All right, now y'all gonna be here, right?

31
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,972
Hold up.

32
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,871
Yo, Boo!

33
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,346
I'm gonna slide up through here.

34
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,213
Bailey, you gonna cover the alley.

35
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:14,519
Yo!

36
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,257
Yo, Maurice short, man.

37
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:24,989
-How short?
-Three.

38
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,962
Tell him to grow a couple of inches.

39
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:34,035
Where you gonna be at?

40
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,940
That be the trap right there, homes.

41
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,037
You figure they roll
through the alley for sure?

42
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,913
Man, rats always run
to holes in times of danger.

43
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,910
And you him, ain't you?

44
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,011
-Who?
-Danger.

45
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,324
Naw, man, I'm just a nigger
with a plan, that all.

46
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,916
And a shotgun.

47
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,023
For sure.

48
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,929
Sorry I'm late.

49
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,501
Got myself lost down the other hallway.

50
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:08,137
-That leads to the loading dock.
-Yeah, and deep storage.

51
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,376
So, this is where they put you?

52
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,240
Quite a message they're sending.

53
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,371
-Yeah, and that message is....
-Out of sight, out of mind.

54
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,541
Spoken like a true troglodyte.

55
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,685
Whole lot of dead trees
behind this nonsense.

56
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,780
The foundation of your case, Detective.

57
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,086
You lay it in right, you can build on it.

58
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,788
You lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.

59
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,158
We ready?

60
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:36,091
Do you solemnly swear and affirm
that the affidavit is true...

61
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,329
and accurate to the best of your knowledge?

62
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,426
-I do.
-I do.

63
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,530
Then by the power vested in me,
I now declare you man and wife.

64
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,106
-Did he swear already?
-The state's attorney?

65
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,201
Yeah.

66
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,302
I see it.

67
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,210
Second copy is sealed for the court,
and the police get the others.

68
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,546
How's this work?

69
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,345
Same frequency as the one
carried by D'Angelo Barksdale.

70
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,787
He gets a page, we get a page.

71
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,526
-So, we up now?
-It's official.

72
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,457
-You're up.
-Then let the game begin.

73
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,131
Celebrities always seem much smaller
when you meet them in person.

74
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,641
Yo!

75
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:26,940
Yo!

76
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,887
Check it out, here he come.

77
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:36,952
-Somethin' ain't right, yo.
-Watch out, man, he got that boom.

78
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,427
-He's packing.
-Here he come.

79
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,330
Yo, come on, Omar's coming, man!

80
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,927
Oh, shit!

81
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,119
Yeah...

82
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,360
the cheese stands alone.

83
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,532
-How you know?
-'Cause if you could, I'd have been had.

84
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,028
Yo, he saying you can't catch the bug...

85
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,868
just by getting your dick sucked.

86
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,137
Dumb-ass, you gotta be
in some pussy to get it, all right?

87
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:29,112
Man, wear a coat if you want,
don't nobody like suckin' on a rubber.

88
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,910
How would you know?

89
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,988
Who you trying to fuck anyway?

90
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,755
Arletta Mouzone. Treenee's cousin.

91
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,494
Damn, man, in that case
use a big-ass condom, all right?

92
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,930
You need a trash bag. Fuck that.

93
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,730
I wouldn't run up in that bitch
with D'Angelo's dick....

94
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,929
It's triflin'.

95
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,192
Easy to see why niggers come
around here stealing our shit!

96
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,229
Yo, you know what, nigger?

97
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,700
What?

98
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,169
Forget it.

99
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:36,576
142 isn't a working telephone exchange.

100
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,742
Six intercepts so far,
and five aren't working numbers?

101
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,217
Something wrong with the recorder?

102
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,757
We're getting what you'd expect,
seven digits of a telephone number...

103
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,225
and a two-digit add-on to identify the caller,
like here, 13.

104
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,593
McNulty, line one.

105
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,725
-Yeah.
-Did youjust get a 142 exchange?

106
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,392
Yeah, that's what we got, too.

107
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,494
-That's fucked up.
-All right, later.

108
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,404
He's got the same numbers
on the readout of the cloned pagers.

109
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,944
So it's not the recorder.

110
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,537
These mopes are using a code
to cover their calls?

111
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:12,515
-That's pretty damn sophisticated.
-What is?

112
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,087
They've coded the telephone numbers
in their pager messages.

113
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,247
How do you know?

114
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,689
Every time the Barksdale kid's pager
goes off...

115
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,886
this machine gives us a message and time.

116
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,021
McNulty's carrying a cloned pager,
but this is what we use in court.

117
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,530
Same with those pen registers.

118
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,602
Every time a pay phone
in the low-rise court is used...

119
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:34,298
we get the telephone number,
the time and the duration of the call.

120
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,700
Incoming calls, too.

121
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,674
Spy shit. Very cool.

122
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,337
You say they're using some kind of code?

123
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,745
Yeah, they got to be.
These numbers don't make no fuckin' sense.

124
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,046
-You rang?
-Omar's ride.

125
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:53,385
Bubbles spotted it.

126
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,360
Different tags, no stolen report,
these come back right for the van...

127
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,829
but Bubs makes it
by the cargo rack on the roof.

128
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,129
Good scope. You wanna take him?

129
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,595
Can't hurt to try.

130
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,132
We pop Omar, get a gun,
he might let us work him.

131
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:11,175
Anything coming through on the pager?

132
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,709
Eight hits so far,
most of them in some kind of code.

133
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,181
These ain't Baltimore exchanges,
that's for sure.

134
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:24,744
Three weeks to get Daniels to agree,
a week to write out the affidavit...

135
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,154
and then this bullshit.

136
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:29,925
How complex a code can it be
if these knuckleheads are using it?

137
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,197
Then again, what does it say
about us if we can't break it?

138
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,833
You wanna run Bubs back downtown,
I'll sit here and wait for you.

139
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,131
All right.

140
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,471
-What'd I miss, girlfriend?
-Not a goddamn thing.

141
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,808
Yeah, boring, ain't we?

142
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,412
How y'all do what you do every day
and not wanna get high?

143
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,411
That's what I be asking.

144
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,753
It's been a little hectic down here,
right, cuz?

145
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,560
String, man, I can't lie.

146
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,869
Them stick-up boys,
they caught us dead up.

147
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:15,598
And the knockos, shit,
I don't know what the fuck that was.

148
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,401
5-0. Comin' up!

149
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,273
-5-0 comin' up, y'all.
-Time-out.

150
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,473
-C'mon, man, what is that?
-What?

151
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,743
You gotta get your crew
to understand that...

152
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,978
it's the stick-up crews and the creepers...

153
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,645
that give us the most trouble.

154
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,655
When they start thinking like that...

155
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,282
you're not gonna have any more surprises,
you feel me?

156
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,588
'Cause you know, your uncle and me...

157
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,528
we think you got a snitch up in the shop.

158
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:42,691
-What?
-Someone who tips off the stick-up crew.

159
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,528
And you gotta be on that, right?
You gotta be on that.

160
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,700
I'm gonna tell you what you do.

161
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,174
What day is it today, Friday?

162
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,801
What happen on Friday?

163
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,910
-Payday.
-Not this Friday.

164
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,004
Why not?

165
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,914
No, what you gonna do
is you gonna call 'em...

166
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,714
Iike you gonna pay 'em
and then you crack 'em.

167
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,345
You tell 'em you're not happy...

168
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,686
with what they fuckin' pass
as work down here.

169
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,057
And when you're not happy,
they ain't gettin' paid. You feel me?

170
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,689
Yeah, but String, you don't pay a nigger,
he ain't gonna work for you.

171
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,063
What, you think a nigger's gonna get a job?

172
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,602
You think these niggers
gonna be like, "Fuck it...

173
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,899
"Iet me quit this game here
and go to college"?

174
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,567
Naw, they gonna buck a little,
but they not gonna walk.

175
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,269
-And in the end, you gonna get respect.
-Yeah.

176
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,582
And when that money run out,
they'll come up to you and roll on you...

177
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,846
And when that money run out,
they'll come up to you and roll on you...

178
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:37,081
and ask you for an advance and shit,
when they flat-ass broke.

179
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,390
Them the niggers
that you strike off your list.

180
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,154
But that nigger that stay eatin'...

181
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:47,031
the nigger that steady rollin',
ain't askin' you for shit...

182
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,759
that's the nigger I want
to hear about. Understand?

183
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,837
Yeah, man, shit, you know how
to play a nigger into a corner, String.

184
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,242
-Yo, take care of this right here.
-You my favorite girl.

185
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,979
Shit, let me handle this, man.

186
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,415
-Yo, Poot.
-Yeah, l--

187
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,488
-Come here, man.
-What's happening?

188
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,321
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?

189
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,188
You know the fuckin' rules.

190
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:43,118
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Copying.

191
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,891
A telephone.

192
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,418
This fucking detail is too much for me.

193
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,630
It's after 3:00.

194
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,898
So, where are the boys at?

195
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,568
Maybe they only come out at night.

196
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,276
I used to have a guy
like Omar working for me.

197
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,351
Guy named Reuben Terry.

198
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,012
Is he good?

199
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,419
Saw the street like we wish we could.

200
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,558
Ain't nothing like a good Cl.

201
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,358
School's out.

202
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,267
Can I use your cell phone?

203
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,347
Yeah, I got that. I did.

204
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:52,981
I know.

205
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:54,524
I don't know about this....

206
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:57,527
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-How can I trust you....

207
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,588
For chrissakes, Elena, I'm their father.
You think I'd let 'em sleep on the floor?

208
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,792
Yes, I got them.

209
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,566
Sheets, pillows, comforters, pillowcases.

210
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,799
I fuckin' got them.

211
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,067
What color are they?

212
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,076
Color, what the fuck do you care
what color they are? Hello?

213
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,544
-Lost her.
-I bet.

214
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,084
You know something?

215
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:27,388
My ex-wife, the way she acts sometimes,
the way she deals with shit...

216
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:34,688
you would think a less enlightened man
than myself, cruder man than myself...

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,702
a man less sensitized to the qualities
and charms and value of women...

218
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,399
a man like that, not me, but a man like that,
he just might call her a cunt.

219
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,976
You just called the mother
of your children a cunt.

220
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,545
No, I did not call her that.

221
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,580
-Yes, you fuckin' did.
-No, I did not.

222
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,149
Let's just leave this, okay?
I got some stuff to do.

223
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:59,586
5-0, gotta go.
Whoa, man, get out the way!

224
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,154
Shit.

225
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:11,235
Not much fighting this time.
You getting tired, asshole?

226
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,668
Still dragging from
the whupping Kima put on him.

227
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,865
Fucked you up like
a cop should, didn't she?

228
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:19,466
That's one thing about Kima,
she put a hurtin' on you like a man.

229
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:22,441
Get your monkey ass up.

230
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,345
You're gonna want your
business card back, right?

231
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,046
Come on.

232
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,252
From Bantry Bay to the Derry Quay

233
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,763
And from Galway to Dublin town

234
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,925
Well, I've never seen

235
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,928
My brown Colleen

236
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,538
That I met in the County Down

237
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,009
There's a man in the County Down

238
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,721
There's a man in the County Down

239
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,657
First, I go in, play nice.

240
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:13,492
-Then you come in, play bad.
-I ain't gonna be playin'.

241
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,904
Bracelet too tight?

242
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,530
You rackin' up all kinds of points, ain't you?

243
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:52,660
First, you put a cop in the hospital,
damn near kill his ass with that punch.

244
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,735
Now, you on the wing from Boys' Village.

245
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,900
Man, I'm 16, all right?
What the fuck they gonna do to me?

246
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,974
That's the least of your worries, my friend.

247
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:06,915
I got a partner outside who can't wait
to get in here and fuck you up.

248
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,785
Cop you banged was Herc's uncle.

249
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,215
Herc wants off the leash on this one.

250
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:18,160
And I suppose you
at the other end of that leash?

251
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,469
See, I don't want to play it that way.

252
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,636
I know about comin' up hard and all.

253
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,738
Why, you came up hard?

254
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,416
Flag House projects. Eastside.

255
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,718
Yeah, Flag House?

256
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:49,822
You know, you remind me of me.

257
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,832
I'm thinking we should work something out.

258
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:01,666
What do I get?

259
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:09,508
What you want?

260
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,779
I want....

261
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,584
for you to suck my dick.

262
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,967
I'll beat your fuckin' monkey ass.

263
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,636
You supposed to be the good cop,
dumb motherfucker.

264
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:38,072
What?

265
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,923
-Hello, may I help you?
-Yeah, we'd like a table.

266
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,684
And you have reservations?

267
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,251
Naw, I thought, you know,
we could just walk in....

268
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,194
Let me see what I got.

269
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:03,059
That's two?

270
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,197
Follow me, please.

271
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,117
Your coat, ma'am?

272
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:26,155
-Can we get that one, over there?
-It's Friday night...

273
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,282
those are for patrons
who made reservations.

274
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,327
Let me get your chair for you, ma'am.

275
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,362
-It's okay, man, all right.
-Here you are.

276
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:39,369
Here you are, sir.

277
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,907
Your waiter will be with you shortly.

278
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,172
You shoulda pushed him, Dee.

279
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:13,998
Bastards.

280
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,617
Sarge, nobody answers at juvenile intake
and we been calling.

281
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,855
Clearly, they're not
as dedicated as you two detectives.

282
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,864
So what time does
the duty intake consultant get here?

283
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:45,265
You missed the 8:00.
You got another one around midnight.

284
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,739
-Midnight?
-You think maybe if we left you...

285
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:53,038
the paperwork, you could put him
in the box 'til intake gets here?

286
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,055
Hemorrhoid.

287
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,007
For the crumbs.

288
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,042
Yeah, right.

289
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,406
-You like your dinner?
-Yeah.

290
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:36,216
-That shrimp was right.
-Yeah, it was good, right?

291
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,326
Think they know?

292
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,495
Do they know what?

293
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,157
You know. What I'm about.

294
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:52,096
What you mean, Dee?

295
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,766
Come on, you know, it's like...

296
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:58,574
we get all dressed up, right?

297
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,577
Come all the way across town.
Fancy place like this.

298
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,375
After we finished, we gonna
go down to the harbor.

299
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:06,279
Walk around a little bit, you know?

300
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,978
Acting like we belong down here,
know what I'm saying?

301
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,749
So? Your money good, right?

302
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,187
Dee, we ain't the only black people in here.

303
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:21,493
It ain't what I'm talking about.
It's about where we.... Come on, you know.

304
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:26,135
I'm just saying, you know,
I feel like some shit just stay with you...

305
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,600
you know what I'm saying,
like, hard as you try...

306
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:32,232
you still can't go nowhere,
you know what I'm saying?

307
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:36,074
-Can I interest you in dessert?
-Yes, thank you.

308
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,050
-Can I have some chocolate cake?
-I'll bring the cart.

309
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,847
Boy, don't nobody give a damn
about you and your story.

310
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,189
You got money,
you get to be whatever you say you are.

311
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,058
That's the way it is.

312
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,293
Sir, I'm sorry. These are the samples.

313
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,036
And for you, sir? Very good.

314
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,489
Don't be a bitch, admit it.

315
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,522
Go ahead.

316
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:29,293
-Admit you're wrong, be a man.
-Yeah, I gotta confess...

317
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,094
this sub beats chink-ass Bob's by a mile.

318
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:33,638
'Course, you might be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers...

319
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,732
'Course, you might be all that when it comes
to thumpin' on niggers...

320
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:39,469
but you can't do shit with that stick, man.

321
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,473
-You'd do better.
-I play.

322
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:44,314
Says he plays.

323
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:47,875
He might.

324
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,284
I'm even better with two hands.

325
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,290
I checked it out, man.
Stinkum true on this one.

326
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:57,354
Except for that nigger, Scar,
from New York...

327
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,687
Edmondson gully is wide open.

328
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,162
What about Tee-Tee's crew?

329
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,235
Naw, them niggers dried up
when they took that federal charge.

330
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:06,860
Most of 'em laid up somewhere,
gettin' high and shit.

331
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:10,463
I'll tell you what. You holler at the boy Scar.

332
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,203
Let him know, man, it's time
for him to take a stroll.

333
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,371
If he give you any beef at all,
we'll put Wee-Bey and Bird on it.

334
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,881
-All right.
-And then once we got him outta there...

335
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:22,851
we'll send in the smokers to run out
all the little poop-butt locals and shit.

336
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,752
Or, if you think
there's some cats in there who got game...

337
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,088
-then we put 'em on our team.
-All right, who you want to run it?

338
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,956
-Send Stinkum up here.
-All right.

339
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,088
He the one who saw the shot.
So, he gets a shot.

340
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,473
All right, okay, not bad.

341
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:48,911
Can't let the duty officer see that.

342
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,675
You wanna give it a rest, man?
You down $60.

343
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,378
That might be your whole damn salary,
but I clock that shit in minutes.

344
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:59,047
-Rack 'em and break 'em, man.
-You the guys waiting for juvenile intake?

345
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,920
He's in the squad room.

346
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,828
If I had more time, I'd run you.

347
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,365
Give you a tip, Preston.

348
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,893
You gonna run a hustle,
you best stay with what you know.

349
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:16,799
Man, fuck you and your
tired-ass advice, all right?

350
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:23,408
But that sandwich was good.

351
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:37,052
You gonna move our little thing
down to Edmondson Avenue.

352
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,753
Take the gully.

353
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,790
What about Scar?

354
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,125
Who?

355
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,164
Listen, I'm giving you points
on the package...

356
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,475
so, you make a go of it, you hear me?

357
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:57,108
You working for yourself, too,
so you gonna put out the strong product...

358
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,410
and you gonna get the locals behind it.

359
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,577
It's as simple as that.
You get your team together, you feel me?

360
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:06,145
Go and wait for me downstairs.
I'll be down in a minute, man.

361
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:11,092
-We gonna make this money run in a few.
-Smile or something, nigger.

362
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,763
-Made that nigger's night.
-Yeah, he deserved it, though.

363
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,027
He deserved it.

364
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:23,364
It's Wee-Bey. We got one.

365
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,840
-You think it's Omar?
-Nah.

366
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:30,572
-It's one of the young 'uns, I think.
-One down, two to go, right?

367
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:34,373
Yeah, motherfuckers. Try to rob me, baby.

368
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:25,160
One, two, three.

369
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,528
-A winner.
-A match? Which case?

370
00:28:56,634 --> 00:29:00,263
The one you just brought me, Bunk.
Casing in that girl shot up in Northeast.

371
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,339
-Kresson?
-Diedre Kresson, right, yeah.

372
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,170
She matches up with two other cases,
both from last year.

373
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,541
-Which ones?
-Toreen Boyle....

374
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,548
-Someone named Ligget. It's in the report.
-It's Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett.

375
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,776
Yeah, them.

376
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:18,117
Casings from all three killings go to a .45,
probably Colt Classic.

377
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:22,653
-That fucker Landsman. How's he do it?
-You like Landsman for these three?

378
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,022
I don't know, Bunk.

379
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:28,827
As sergeants go, Jay's a sociopath and all,
but I'd have to go with an actual gangster.

380
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,466
Jimmy, you sitting down?

381
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,233
I said it was hot, but ifyou
got these barbecue gloves.

382
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,199
You got a Johnny Weeks up in here?

383
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,936
-Who?
-Johnny Weeks.

384
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,478
-Over in the game room.
-Obliged.

385
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,071
-Any smokes?
-I'm out.

386
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,084
How long have you been here?
You gotta give the medication...

387
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,086
a chance to work in your system, man.

388
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,091
Brought you something.

389
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:08,163
Yeah, some chicken pieces and some fries.

390
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,940
Bought you a shake,
but I dropped it on the bus.

391
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,281
It comes in a bag, goes out in a bag.

392
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,185
How long you have that for?

393
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,163
-I fucked up, man.
-Yeah, I saw.

394
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,130
-I fucked up, man.
-Yeah, I saw.

395
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,463
There was nothing I could do, you know?

396
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,770
It's like first I got beat, right, then I get this.

397
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,704
What are these for?

398
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,307
They say I got the bug.

399
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,215
The bug?

400
00:30:58,322 --> 00:31:00,187
They checked me when
I was in the hospital--

401
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,519
Are they sure?

402
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,468
Where you been at?

403
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,698
Here and there, I'm at it.

404
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,605
I'd have come past sooner,
but I been on kinda like a mission.

405
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,372
-A mission?
-Yeah. Them hoppers that beat you down...

406
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,742
they got problems now.

407
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,009
Them and the people they sling for, even.

408
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,106
What?

409
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,386
I put the police on their ass.

410
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:32,789
Police?

411
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,188
-What, you get locked up or something?
-No, come on.

412
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,160
No, I'm not working for them.
I'm working with them.

413
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:42,056
They don't give me the badge soon enough,
I keep doing like I do.

414
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,265
Why?

415
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:49,403
What do you mean why?
How can you ask me why?

416
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:53,740
Why the fuck are you in here, man,
with all these falling-down motherfuckers?

417
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,971
Why you passing shit through a bag?

418
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,106
Why they beat you down?

419
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,910
Why I couldn't do nothing about it?

420
00:32:01,952 --> 00:32:03,977
It's all part of the game, right?

421
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,318
I mean, you taught me that.

422
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:20,766
What you up to in here, man?

423
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,075
-Doing the meetings.
-N.A.?

424
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,572
Yeah. Twice a day.

425
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,240
That's good, man. It's good,
you give the body comfort, you know.

426
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,651
-Yeah.
-No, you needed a change.

427
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:39,713
Guess so.

428
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,087
I'll be getting out of here
the end of the month.

429
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,322
It's all right. They got meetings everywhere.

430
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,455
You ain't gotta worry about that.

431
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,358
Bubs.

432
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,841
Who's got the best package now?

433
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:01,068
-Get the fuck out of here, man.
-I'm coming home, right?

434
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:07,540
Shit is weak all over, you know?

435
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,382
Got some boys up in Baker
and Calhoun, though.

436
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,615
They had a smoker out
the other day though.

437
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:15,055
-Yeah?
-Knocked a couple of niggers out.

438
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,691
Ain't you a trip?

439
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:21,426
Beat down, bagged up,
still ready to rip and run, huh?

440
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,430
I'm a Viking, homes.

441
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,735
"I'm a Viking, homes."

442
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,273
McNulty.

443
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:40,509
There's something here that needs kissing.

444
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,584
Speak again, toothless one.

445
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:47,054
I guess you know now why I wear
the stripes in the family.

446
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,252
Good call, Jay. Of course, if Keeley
hadn't fucked the scene up...

447
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,261
you'd have had that casing
months ago, right?

448
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,593
Keeley. Let Keeley be Keeley.

449
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:57,394
We all can't be princes
of the city, now can we?

450
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,068
Speaking of which...

451
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,427
sit down.

452
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:07,236
May I ask you a question
that is essential to your career?

453
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:09,335
-What?
-Who do you serve?

454
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,814
I am asking you to identify for the record
your commanding officer.

455
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,614
-Major Rawls.
-Excellent.

456
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:21,087
And with that thought in mind, I advise you
to go immediately into the Major's office...

457
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,683
carrying the break
I've given you in the Kresson case...

458
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:25,523
and kiss the man's ring. Because...

459
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,223
I have talked you right out of the shithouse.

460
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:29,963
Here's the deal.

461
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,762
You wrap up this thing
with Narcotics in two weeks.

462
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,998
You put yourself back in the rotation
when we go back to night work.

463
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:38,802
You do that and you're back in the fold.

464
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,608
-Thanks, Jay.
-No problem.

465
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,572
Shit ain't right.

466
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,618
You work, you get paid.

467
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,219
That's what I'm saying.

468
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,118
I'm gonna say something to him, all right?

469
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,453
-You should.
-Truth.

470
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,486
-What's up, Dee?
-What's up, Shorty?

471
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:06,333
$530, the count is right, man.

472
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:10,564
Okay, re-ups on the way down.

473
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:12,608
Go tell Sterling to be ready for it.

474
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,371
All right. Yo, Dee, man.

475
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,678
You know, me and Poot,
we been steady working it, you know?

476
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:20,909
Nothing sloppy, no troubles, right?

477
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:22,342
No.

478
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,083
And we was wondering if, maybe you could
let a little something go...

479
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:31,093
until payday, 'cause you know, right now,
we some broke-ass niggers, man.

480
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,508
Right now, whoever did our girl...

481
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,601
also did Boyd and Leggett a month earlier.

482
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:51,010
-Leggett.
-And those two are definitely...

483
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,049
straight-up drug executions.

484
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,247
No mention of Dee in either file.

485
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,684
But I did get a fresh number...

486
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:00,679
-on Tywanda.
-Who?

487
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:02,925
The girl who called in on Kresson.

488
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,426
-Right.
-She put Dee in for that.

489
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:05,961
Have you seen this?

490
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,293
Jaybird.

491
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:14,096
And the bear said, "You didn't
really come here to hunt now, did you?"

492
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,601
-You see Saturday's 24s?
-Sunday morning.

493
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,837
Did you see the one Worden
got on the Westside?

494
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,473
John Bailey, in a Kevlar vest,
lit up by three separate shooters.

495
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,409
Carey Street.

496
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,110
You made the Kresson connection...

497
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,653
you didn't think Bailey might tie in
with Barksdale?

498
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:36,556
Worden's on the other shift.
I'm trying to work my murders, Jesus Christ.

499
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,859
Tony, Line 3.

500
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,825
What took you so long?

501
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:43,695
You might've heard, we get a few murders
here in Baltimore...

502
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,132
sometimes we just get backed up.

503
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:48,227
-You weren't followed here?
-Why would we be followed?

504
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,936
Diedre was playing with scary people.

505
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,907
Who might that be?

506
00:36:57,414 --> 00:37:01,009
You called this in after the murder
and you told the detective...

507
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,552
that you talked to her
the night she was killed.

508
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,451
She called. It was late.

509
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,617
She didn't talk long, she said she had to go.
Dee was at the door.

510
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,888
And that was the last time
you spoke with her?

511
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:15,796
-Yeah, she was killed that night.
-Dee was her boyfriend?

512
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,865
No, Dee was his nephew or something.

513
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,369
Dee would be D'Angelo Barksdale.

514
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:22,706
And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?

515
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,697
And the boyfriend, Avon Barksdale?

516
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,807
You know Avon?

517
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,111
The question is how do you know him?

518
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,681
You out there running
the street with the players?

519
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,306
I used to be...

520
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:37,451
but not after this thing with Diedre.
I mean, damn.

521
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,283
We used to go to Odell's for ladies' nights...

522
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,893
and one time he was there with all
his people in one of the big booths...

523
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:48,021
ordering drinks,
acting like he was king of everything.

524
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:50,529
And Diedre ate that shit up.

525
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,893
-And you?
-I ain't gonna lie.

526
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,206
I did the club thing for a while, but...

527
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,077
some of those places,
everybody in there's on some kind of game.

528
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,875
But Diedre went with Avon?

529
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,075
She was with Avon for like a year...

530
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:11,314
and something happened. Toward the end,
she started getting real possessive...

531
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,357
and that didn't sit with Avon,
'cause he has other girls, too.

532
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,323
She started bitching on him one minute...

533
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,260
crying the next minute,
threatening to do all kinds of things.

534
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,594
-She threatened Avon Barksdale?
-The girl was off the hook.

535
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,865
One time, she threatened
to write a letter on him.

536
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,666
-A letter.
-A letter to the state's attorney.

537
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,472
Supposed to be some sort of kin to her.

538
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:35,342
She said that if he dumped her...

539
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,573
she was gonna tell about the drugs.

540
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:40,415
-Did she write this letter?
-I don't know.

541
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:45,044
I tried talking to her about the way she
was acting, but she wouldn't let it go.

542
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:48,921
She even had it out with him in his club
one night in front of all the people.

543
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,323
What, Avon has a club?

544
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:52,725
Orlando's, titty bar.

545
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,431
-Does he own it?
-That's what Diedre said.

546
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,199
She said he owned a whole mess of stuff.

547
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,715
-Tell me something, man.
-What's that?

548
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,457
How can you run this place
and not just OD on pussy?

549
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:21,546
Shit.

550
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,527
You try dealing with all these bitches
and their problems for a few days.

551
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,759
Get so you'd rather be running a goddamn
laundromat out this fucker.

552
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,461
Heard you're doing okay in the Pit.

553
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,738
-Yeah, well.
-What, you ain't getting it like that?

554
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,169
Man, my uncle
still got me working on salary.

555
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,505
Damn, boy.

556
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,206
You ain't the only one
your uncle keeps close.

557
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:45,403
What?

558
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,976
Come on, man, you ain't making no ends?

559
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,053
I know you getting
something on this by now.

560
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,143
No, man.

561
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,514
I'm just the front,
clean name for the liquor board.

562
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,388
-I'm saying--
-What the fuck?

563
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:59,326
Is there a problem?
That was for the drink before.

564
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:00,361
It was for this one.

565
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,297
It ain't like I'm calling your uncle out
or nothing...

566
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,733
but give a nigger a chance.
Plenty of pie out there for everybody.

567
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:07,804
Believe.

568
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,534
You heard Stinkum gonna be coming off
the clock, right? Getting a percentage.

569
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,974
-What?
-Open up fresh territory.

570
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:16,944
Take over the corners
down near Edmondson and Brice.

571
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:20,439
So, my uncle gave that to Stink?

572
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,649
Figured you knew.

573
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:25,348
Orlando!

574
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,983
Excuse me, Orlando,
can you help me down here, please?

575
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:32,289
-I already paid for that last drink.
-That was for the drink before.

576
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,660
-Hell, no, that was for this one.
-What's up here?

577
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,962
Look, he ain't paid for that drink
and I took $20 off the bar.

578
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,094
-Look she took $20, then $20 more.
-Hell I did.

579
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,773
Come on, now, why you
gonna do me like this?

580
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,399
I been with you for an hour and a half
buying drinks.

581
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,674
Look, man, this ain't right.
I just spent $1 20 in drinks, $40 in tips.

582
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,076
Now, you gonna take all that
and still try to sneak into my pocket?

583
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:57,153
-Shit, girl!
-You got to go, get him the fuck outta here.

584
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,484
I ain't done so much as touch your kneecap.

585
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,287
Trying to treat her with a little respect,
and this is the way you do me?

586
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:04,758
Wait, wait!

587
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,967
Why you do that?

588
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:24,914
-Did you take his money?
-No, I didn't take his money.

589
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:39,653
You buying me a drink?

590
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,523
Can I see you sometime?

591
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,193
Like, you know, not in here.

592
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,346
I don't usually see men that I meet in here.

593
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,550
Usually.

594
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,593
What kind of strip joint has
a video camera looking out?

595
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:17,791
More to it than the girls, maybe.

596
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:21,599
So, he's got the club,
he's got the warehouse...

597
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,367
he's got the apartment building
by Druid Hill Lake...

598
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,305
he's got the tow truck company...

599
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,369
and that's just what she knew from
what he bragged about to the dead girl.

600
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,714
-Major likes assets.
-The Deputy, too, I imagine.

601
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:38,015
Nothing like a few property forfeitures
to swell the departmental operation budget.

602
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,453
Check city assessments to see
who owns the club.

603
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:43,822
Run the company name through
the state corporate charter office.

604
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:47,488
Also, Homicide picked up one
Saturday night. Might be one of ours.

605
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,633
John Bailey, he's a stick-up artist
I used to know from the Murphy homes.

606
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,726
He was wearing Kevlar, but it didn't help.

607
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,670
39 casings on the scene,
from three different guns.

608
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,031
Overkill for a burn bag...

609
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,841
but about right if he was running with Omar.

610
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:03,572
Lookit, our buddy.

611
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,054
Just once, I wish they'd use
the right number.

612
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:26,829
Ain't like him to be late.

613
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:37,573
Bailey, you fucking dope fiend.
I'm telling you...

614
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,783
them fucking people ain't to be relied on.

615
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,315
Why you always gotta talk like that, man?

616
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,888
-What?
-"F" this and "f" that.

617
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:51,654
If I give it up,
I lose half of what I mean to say.

618
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,192
Don't nobody want
to hear them dirty words, man.

619
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,494
Especially coming from
such a beautiful mouth.

620
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:14,814
Wait for Bailey?

621
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,312
Early bird catches the worm, dog.

622
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:47,949
-I beeped you.
-I didn't get it.

623
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,018
-Let me see.
-You want to see my pager?

624
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:55,953
Sure, Prez, you want to see my pager?

625
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,059
-I beeped you too.
-You all right, Prez?

626
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:02,529
714-3432?

627
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,991
I got that. That was you?

628
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:07,594
You try it?

629
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,866
Yeah, I tried it. Twice.

630
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:11,672
Non-working number.

631
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,741
It would've worked if you knew the code.

632
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,546
Shit, I'm as surprised as you.

633
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:25,950
I like word-search puzzles.

634
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:28,856
You know, where you gotta
find the hidden words?

635
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,360
So, I thought I could do the same thing
with the numbers.

636
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,660
Take the number I sent you.

637
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:39,495
Now, take the seven
and jump it over the five.

638
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,060
You get three.

639
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,204
Jump the one over the five...

640
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:45,834
you get nine.

641
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,135
With four you get six.

642
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:52,178
Three, that's seven, four is six...

643
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,772
a three again...

644
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,078
and two is eight.

645
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,950
Zero switches with the five.

646
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:03,024
So 714-3432 is...

647
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:07,495
396-7678.

648
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:09,596
Our number.

649
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,935
And that's the code?

650
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:17,034
And it works, because it's all about
where the buttons are on a phone.

651
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,205
If it was a code that involved math...

652
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,004
or algebra or whatever...

653
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,673
these little yos in the projects
wouldn't be able to follow along.

654
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,415
But with this, all you gotta do
is jump the five button.

655
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:31,578
Ain't no math to it. It's just...

656
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,119
how a phone looks when you look at it.

657
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,715
Prez, you little genius!

658
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:41,094
-Jesus.
-I could kill you, that's so good.

659
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:46,533
Your mother keep ragging at me...

660
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:49,969
to take him outta here and put him
in a private nursing home.

661
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,608
You know, she ain't never gonna let that go.

662
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,168
I keep telling her, man, we can't show
this legit money yet, man...

663
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,578
especially since he ain't got no insurance.

664
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,014
Soon, though.

665
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:05,385
So, you ain't big on coming here, right?

666
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,013
No.

667
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:09,954
Tell you something, man...

668
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,187
you about to see your uncle,
you understand me?

669
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:14,422
-This is family.
-I know.

670
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,295
Family is what counts,
family is what it's about.

671
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,095
Family gonna always be there
'cause it's blood.

672
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,473
Man.

673
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,155
You never figured on this, did you?

674
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:54,668
Live the life, lead the life. Ain't no big thing.

675
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:59,065
He used to talk that shit all the time and he
believed it, you know what I'm saying?

676
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:01,336
What's up, baby, talk that shit now.

677
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,483
You know, you're right.
It's kind of hard to be in here right now.

678
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,848
He scare you, don't he?

679
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:15,822
-You know, I'm just saying--
-He scares me.

680
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,195
See, if he dead, you know,
I could carry it better.

681
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,101
Coming up the way we did,
you kind of expect that.

682
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,268
Waiting on it.

683
00:48:32,475 --> 00:48:33,464
See...

684
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:37,378
the thing is, you only got to fuck up once.

685
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:43,349
Be a little slow, be a little late. Just once.

686
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:48,221
And how you ain't gonna never be slow...

687
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,487
never be late?

688
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,097
You can't plan for no shit like this, man.

689
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:56,823
It's life.

690
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:08,869
Scares me.

691
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:26,426
They're still using it.
I was by on Saturday night and it was gone.

692
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,294
On your own time?

693
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,424
You still getting your boys?

694
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:35,003
Yeah, tonight for a sleep-over.

695
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,101
Omar's rolling.

696
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,583
What the hell?

697
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,155
Call for backup?

698
00:49:57,093 --> 00:49:58,060
Not yet.

699
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,591
Let's see how it plays out.

700
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,109
An invitation.

701
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,747
Feel a little lonesome for backup.

702
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:24,080
Yeah, me, too.

703
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:27,121
That's nice.

704
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:29,826
-I'll check the rear.
-I'll watch the boys.

705
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,138
Afternoon, gentlemen.

706
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,576
Saying, if you were gonna use that
you would've been done using it by now.

707
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,508
It's clean.

708
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,706
Got to keep it clean.

709
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,287
We having one of our little parlays like this,
got to keep it clean, right?

710
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,483
Omar with no gun on the street?
Must be a first.

711
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,350
Yeah, sometimes
who you are is enough, dog.

712
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:09,330
But being as y'all sitting on my ride so long,
I thought I'd save y'all some time.

713
00:51:09,432 --> 00:51:10,922
Come straight on out.

714
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,327
I ain't taking no charge.
You ain't putting me back in no cage.

715
00:51:14,437 --> 00:51:16,371
We're not here to bury you, Omar.

716
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,873
We're pulling you up 'cause
we got a problem in common.

717
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,875
-Problem?
-Barksdale.

718
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:24,041
-No, he ain't no problem.
-I don't know.

719
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,681
Avon's been chalking up a lot of bodies.
And you being you....

720
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:31,210
Put it that way,
I guess he could be a little problem...

721
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,551
but I just can't really come out
and help you all.

722
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:34,714
You know what I mean?

723
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:37,452
Snitchin' just rubs me wrong.

724
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,786
Personally, I don't think
the game is played like that.

725
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,361
We respect that.

726
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,457
If you do happen to take a charge though...

727
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,665
I'm McNulty, that's Greggs.

728
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,600
You give us a call, we'll sort something out.

729
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:51,833
Fair enough.

730
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:57,111
You know, I used to work the homes,
back when your brother was up there.

731
00:51:58,414 --> 00:51:59,847
You get a chance...

732
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,713
Iet him know they blew up
John Bailey last night.

733
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:05,476
Good man.

734
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,251
Lot of enemies.

735
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,484
Saying, you trying to catch up with Bird?

736
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:15,388
Word is he dropped a workin' man.

737
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:19,566
Wait, hold up. Come on, don't play me.

738
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,603
What workin' man, what Bird?

739
00:52:21,704 --> 00:52:24,730
Come on, now,
ain't but one working man, now, is there?

740
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,608
And Bird?
I think your snitch can handle that.

741
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:31,176
Shit, Bubbles know Bird.

742
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,789
You working late?

743
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,927
A little.

744
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:19,221
Got a minute?

745
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:21,494
Sure, have a seat.

746
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,326
No, this is better said standing up.

747
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,265
You know, I've been 13 years on the shelf.
I ain't bitched.

748
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:30,368
It was me that put me there.

749
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:33,406
But I'm here now, and I gotta say a piece.

750
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,506
We should've had a tap
on the project pay phones by now.

751
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,877
A wire there will get us the drugs.

752
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,083
Keep pushing,
we'll get a whiff of the money, too.

753
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,455
I know you're serious
about climbing that career ladder...

754
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,425
and I know how slippery
it gets the higher you go...

755
00:53:51,794 --> 00:53:52,988
but for me...

756
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,097
I don't want to go to no dance
unless I can rub some tit.

757
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,729
I appreciate your honesty.

758
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,663
Good night, Lieutenant.

759
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,392
So, what you say to make Dee pay out?

760
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,401
I told him to give it up
or I'm taking him out of the count.

761
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,834
-Shit.
-Look.

762
00:54:35,104 --> 00:54:37,072
I'll pump niggers when I got to.

763
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,113
-That's him.
-That's who?

764
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,579
One of the ones that robbed us.
That light-skinned boy.

765
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,084
That's him?

766
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,327
All right, come on.

767
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,130
I'm the king of this shit.

768
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,326
-So, you want us to wait?
-Yeah.

769
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:07,157
-All right, we on it, man.
-All right.

770
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,776
There goes Scar right there.

771
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,542
Right there in the blue?
