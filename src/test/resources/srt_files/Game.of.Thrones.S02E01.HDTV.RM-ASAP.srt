1
00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:02,989
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:06,459
<i>I have a son, you have a daughter,</i>
<i>we'll join our houses.</i>

3
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:10,364
May I present Viserys
of House Targaryen

4
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:12,599
<i>and his sister</i>
<i>Daenerys?</i>

5
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:15,636
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

6
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,107
Maester says the boy may live.

7
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:23,078
My dear brother, there are times you
make me wonder whose side you're on.

8
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,845
You know how much
I love my family.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,881
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

10
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:28,283
<i>The Starks have</i>
<i>manned the wall</i>

11
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,652
<i>for thousands of years.</i>
<i>And you are a Stark.</i>

12
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:34,289
<i>King Robert's bastards--</i>
<i>Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?</i>

13
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:36,625
<i>The King has</i>
<i>no trueborn sons.</i>

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,427
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

15
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:40,729
- No more than I love mine.
- <i>And they're all Jaime's.</i>

16
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:43,666
<i>When the King returns from</i>
<i>his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.</i>

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,802
I want what I came for. I want
the crown he promised me.

18
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:49,138
- No! No!
- A crown for a king.

19
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:51,407
<i>He was no dragon.</i>

20
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:54,244
Fire cannot kill the dragon.

21
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,379
<i>Jon Snow,</i>
<i>Lord Commander Mormont</i>

22
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:59,014
<i>has requested you</i>
<i>for his personal steward.</i>

23
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,283
He wants to groom you
for command.

24
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,884
Ned! We were hunting.

25
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:06,054
By the time Robert dies, it will be
too late for the both of us.

26
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:07,989
What about Stannis?
He's your older brother.

27
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:09,990
<i>This isn't about the bloody</i>
<i>line of succession.</i>

28
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,892
He's not a king.
I am.

29
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:14,895
- We have a new king now.
- Your son has no claim to the throne.

30
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:17,330
Kill him! Kill all of them!
I command it!

31
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:20,833
You're summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

32
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,635
Joffrey puts my father in chains;
Now he wants his ass kissed?

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,971
I'll go to King's Landing,
but not alone.

34
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,440
<i>Call the Banners.</i>

35
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:31,344
<i>- Kill him, Robb.</i>
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

36
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:33,813
So long as I am your king,

37
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:36,383
<i>treason shall never</i>
<i>go unpunished.</i>

38
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,518
- No! No!
- Stop, my son.

39
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:39,986
You will go
to King's Landing

40
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:42,155
and serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.

41
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,792
<i>You'll bring that boy king to heel,</i>
<i>and his mother, too, if needs be.</i>

42
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:47,627
Please let me go home.

43
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:49,528
Mother says I'm still
to marry you,

44
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:51,831
so you'll stay here
and obey.

45
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:55,133
My sword is yours
in victory and defeat.

46
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:58,903
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

47
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:00,038
What's your name?

48
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:01,539
- Arry.
- Arry the orphan boy.

49
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:04,610
It's 1,000 leagues
from here to the Wall.

50
00:02:04,644 --> 00:02:06,678
We ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

51
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,647
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>will ride in force</i>

52
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,882
<i>against the wildlings,</i>
<i>the White Walkers,</i>

53
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,483
<i>and whatever else</i>
<i>is out there.</i>

54
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:15,286
He will die tonight, Khaleesi.

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,623
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

56
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:20,859
You don't understand.

57
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:24,463
Blood of my blood.

60

Well struck.

61
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,139
Well struck, Dog.

62
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:51,878
Did you like that?

63
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,779
It was well struck,
Your Grace.

64
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,149
I already said
it was well struck.

65
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,519
Yes, Your Grace.

66
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,096
- Who's next?
<i>- Lothor Brune,</i>

67
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,600
freerider in the service
of Lord Baelish.

68
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:16,070
Ser Dontos the Red
of House Hollard.

69
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,576
Ser Dontos the Red
of House Hollard!

70
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,145
<i>Here I am.</i>

71
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,948
Here I am.

72
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,888
Sorry, Your Grace.

73
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:35,723
My deepest apologies.

74
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,524
<i>- Are you drunk?</i>
- No.

75
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:40,261
Uh, no.
No, Your Grace.

76
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:43,063
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

77
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:45,266
That's not much at all.

78
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,768
Please,
have another cup.

79
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:49,170
Are you sure, Your Grace?

80
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:51,506
<i>Yes. To celebrate</i>
<i>my name day.</i>

81
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,243
Have two.
Have as much as you like.

82
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:57,214
I would be honored,
Your Grace.

83
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:01,685
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

84
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:04,020
See that he drinks
his fill.

85
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:24,608
You can't.

86
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:26,409
What did you say?

87
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:29,445
Did you say I can't?

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,148
I only meant
it would be bad luck

89
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,916
to kill a man
on your name day.

90
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,217
What kind of stupid
peasant's superstition...

91
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:38,086
<i>The girl is right.</i>

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,887
<i>What a man sows</i>
<i>on his name day</i>

93
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:41,456
he reaps all year.

94
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:46,628
Take him away.

95
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:48,897
I'll have him killed
tomorrow, the fool.

96
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,435
He is.

97
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,137
A fool--
you're so clever to see it.

98
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:58,574
He'll make a much better fool
than a knight.

99
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:01,911
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,148
Did you hear My Lady,
Ser Dontos?

101
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:09,319
From this day,
you'll be my new fool.

102
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:11,521
Thank you, Your Grace.

103
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,791
And you, My Lady,
thank you.

104
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:17,795
<i>Beloved nephew.</i>

105
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,703
We looked for you
on the battlefield.

106
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,041
You were nowhere
to be found.

107
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,777
I've been here,
ruling the kingdoms.

108
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:38,213
What a fine job
you've done.

109
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,881
Look at you.

110
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,318
More beautiful
than ever.

111
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:47,522
And you! You-- you're going to be
bigger than the hound,

112
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:50,024
but much better looking.

113
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:51,960
This one doesn't like me.

114
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,829
Can't imagine why.

115
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,498
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

116
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,434
Me, too, dear.

117
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,736
Death is so boring,
especially now

118
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,773
with so much excitement
in the world.

119
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,043
My Lady, I'm sorry
for your loss.

120
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:09,113
Her loss?

121
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:11,048
Her father was
a confessed traitor.

122
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,683
But still her father.

123
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:14,719
Surely having so recently
lost your own beloved father

124
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,654
you can sympathize.

125
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,593
My father was a traitor.

126
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,494
My mother and brother
are traitors, too.

127
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,731
I am loyal
to my beloved Joffrey.

128
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,334
Of course you are.

129
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,839
Well, enjoy your name day,
Your Grace.

130
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:38,774
Wish I could stay
and celebrate,

131
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,577
but there is work
to be done.

132
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,612
What work?

133
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,781
Why are you here?

134
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,886
The raven arrived
from the Citadel

135
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,056
- this morning, Your Grace.

136
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,959
The conclave has met,
considered reports

137
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:00,128
from Maesters all over
the Seven Kingdoms,

138
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:03,598
<i>and declared</i>
<i>this great summer</i>

139
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:06,434
done at last.

140
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:09,271
The longest summer
in living memory.

141
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:11,273
The peasants say,
a long summer means

142
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:14,210
- <i>an even longer winter.</i>
<i>- A common superstition.</i>

143
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:17,280
<i>We have enough wheat</i>
<i>for a five-year winter.</i>

144
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:19,582
If it lasts any longer,

145
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,250
we'll have
fewer peasants.

146
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:25,253
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

147
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:26,754
We have nowhere
to house them.

148
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:28,923
And with winter coming,
it'll only get worse.

149
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:31,892
You command the City Watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

150
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:35,262
<i>I do, Your Grace.</i>

151
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,298
And are you not
a Lord at my command?

152
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:40,835
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

153
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,505
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

154
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,474
They belong in the field,
not our capital.

155
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:49,911
Yes, Your Grace.

156
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,250
Don't get up.

157
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,188
More ravishing than ever,
big sister.

158
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:04,992
War agrees with you.

159
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:07,928
Forgive the interruption.
Carry on.

160
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:10,564
What are you doing here?

161
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:14,300
Ah, it's been
a remarkable journey.

162
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:18,004
I pissed off the edge
of the Wall,

163
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,940
<i>I slept in a sky cell,</i>

164
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:23,209
I fought with
the hill tribes--

165
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:25,979
so many adventures,

166
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,716
so much to be
thankful for.

167
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,020
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

168
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,382
Yes. well I, do believe,
the Hand of the King,

169
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,326
is welcome at all
small council meetings.

170
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,362
Our father
is Hand of the King.

171
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:42,432
Yes, but in his absence...

172
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,841
<i>Your father has named</i>
<i>Lord Tyrion</i>

173
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,611
to serve as Hand
in his stead while he fights.

174
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:57,313
Out! All of you out!

175
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:04,688
I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

176
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,690
If I were capable
of tricking father,

177
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,325
I'd be emperor
of the world by now.

178
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,961
You brought this
on yourself.

179
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:12,462
I've done nothing.

180
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,364
Quite right--
you did nothing

181
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,766
when your son called
for Ned Stark's head.

182
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,768
Now the entire North
has risen up against us.

183
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,271
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

184
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,441
That bit of theater will haunt
our family for a generation.

185
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,478
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

186
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:30,714
Do you understand
we're losing the war?

187
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:33,984
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

188
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,786
But I know people.

189
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,888
And I know that our enemies hate
each other

190
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:40,824
almost as much
as they hate us.

191
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,765
- Joffrey is King.
- Joffrey is King.

192
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,334
You are here
to advise him.

193
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:52,036
I'm only here
to advise him.

194
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,605
And if the King listens
to what I say,

195
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,275
the King might just get
his Uncle Jaime back.

196
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,478
How?

197
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,080
You love your children.

198
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:04,614
It's your one
redeeming quality.

199
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:07,583
That and your cheekbones.

200
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:10,452
The Starks love
their children as well.

201
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:13,088
- And we have two of them.
- One.

202
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,659
- One?
- Arya, little animal-- she disappeared.

203
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:20,729
Disappeared?
What, in a puff of smoke?

204
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:25,801
We had three Starks
to trade.

205
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,571
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

206
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:31,573
Father will be furious.

207
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,243
It must be odd for you...

208
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:39,048
to be the disappointing child.

209
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:50,394
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>
<i>watch over your brother</i>

210
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,097
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

211
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:57,101
<i>The walls of my Holdfast</i>
<i>will not stand the winter.</i>

212
00:12:57,136 --> 00:13:01,005
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

213
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,407
and I'm afraid
the masons today

214
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:07,177
are not fit to carry
their fathers' hammers.

215
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,612
When I was a boy,
I remember seeing them

216
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:14,216
<i>put up a new tower</i>
<i>at Torrhen's Square in a summer.</i>

217
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,352
<i>Men worked back then.</i>

218
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:19,288
Today, my Holdfast
looks like it was built

219
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:21,557
by drunk children.

220
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,729
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

221
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,731
<i>And the Gods</i>
<i>forbid it rains.</i>

222
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,001
Why, I might as well sleep
beneath a waterfall.

223
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:32,670
<i>Maintenance of a Holdfast</i>

224
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:36,107
generally falls
to the lord of that Holdfast.

225
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:37,609
Generally, yes,

226
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:39,310
but I've sent
all the young men off

227
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:41,246
to fight
Robb Stark's war.

228
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,382
King Robb.
And it's not his war.

229
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,317
He didn't choose it.

230
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,785
Maybe not, My Lord,

231
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,920
but he called in his Banners
and took the men.

232
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,688
<i>Joffrey killed my father,</i>

233
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:54,157
your liege lord.

234
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,659
Do you remember
your vows, Ser?

235
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:58,561
Of course I remember!

236
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,664
We can spare four masons
for a week, My Lord.

237
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:04,734
Will that be sufficient
to repair your walls?

238
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:07,070
I-- I believe it will.

239
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,380
We didn't want him here
all day, did we?

240
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,684
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

241
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,519
Nor did I.

242
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:26,657
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

243
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:30,762
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

244
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,933
<i>Lord Portan.</i>

245
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:39,002
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>
<i>watch over your brother</i>

246
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:40,770
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

247
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:34,160
Boil this for an hour
and drink the tea.

248
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,697
Makes all your pain
go away.

249
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:39,366
Don't have any pain.

250
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,000
Lucky for you.

251
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:43,903
That way.

252
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,875
You've been having
those dreams again.

253
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:50,743
<i>I don't dream.</i>

254
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,311
Everyone dreams.

255
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:55,280
I don't.

256
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,382
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

257
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,551
<i>They say it's an omen.</i>

258
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,255
They say it means Robb will win
a great victory in the South.

259
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:04,890
Did they?

260
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,229
I heard some other fools
say it's Lannister Red.

261
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:13,633
Means the Lannisters will rule
all Seven Kingdoms before long.

262
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:17,070
Heard a stableboy say
it's the color of blood

263
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:19,473
to mark the death
of your father.

264
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:26,546
The stars
don't fall for men.

265
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,148
The red comet means
one thing, boy--

266
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:31,884
dragons.

267
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,454
The dragons are all dead.

268
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,957
They've been dead
for centuries.

269
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:17,263
Mmm.

270
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:20,232
Mmm. Mmm.

271
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,970
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

272
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:26,672
He said they ate meat.

273
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:30,409
He didn't tell you
what kind of meat?

274
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:33,345
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

275
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:36,514
He didn't know anything
about anything.

276
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:43,989
Eh.

277
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:12,386
She was Drogo's
first gift to me.

278
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,422
I remember.

279
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,927
I promised
to protect them.

280
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:22,295
Promised them their enemies
would die screaming.

281
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,831
How do I make
starvation scream?

282
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,868
A trick I never learned,
I'm afraid.

283
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,771
Does it ever end?

284
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,773
This is farther east
than I've ever been.

285
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,341
But, yes, Khaleesi,

286
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:36,843
everything ends,
even the red waste.

287
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:39,445
And you're sure
there's no other way?

288
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,215
If we go south to the land
of the Lazarheen,

289
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:44,717
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

290
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:46,652
If we go west
to the Dothraki Sea,

291
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:48,721
the first
Khalasar we meet

292
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,289
will kill us
and take your dragons.

293
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:52,992
No one will take
my dragons.

294
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:56,863
They are too weak to fight,

295
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,898
as are your people.

296
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:01,268
You must be
their strength.

297
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,338
As you are mine.

298
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:54,254
Rakharo...

299
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:03,531
You never have.

300
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:12,205
This is bad time to start.

301
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:10,265
Having a rough time of it?

302
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:11,866
Nothing's killed me yet.

303
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:14,469
- Your ass killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

304
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,739
I just wanted you to shut up about
your damn blisters.

305
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:34,555
I was born in a place
like this.

306
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,725
Later, I fell
on hard times.

307
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:41,128
<i>Are those girls?</i>

308
00:21:41,162 --> 00:21:42,963
<i>Craster's daughters.</i>

309
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:46,734
I haven't seen a girl
in six months.

310
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,703
I'd keep on not seeing them
if I were you.

311
00:21:48,737 --> 00:21:52,139
What, he don't like people messing
with his daughters?

312
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:54,976
He don't like people
messing with his wives.

313
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:58,579
He marries
his daughters,

314
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:00,949
<i>and they give him</i>
<i>more daughters.</i>

315
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:03,184
And on and on it goes.

316
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,653
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

317
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:09,591
All the other wildlings for a
hundred leagues have disappeared.

318
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,592
Craster's still here.

319
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,262
He must be doing
something right.

320
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:17,599
What happens
to the boys?

321
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:20,668
- Hmm?
- <i>He marries his daughters.</i>

322
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:23,605
What does he do
with his sons?

323
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,643
He said he planned
to stop here

324
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:30,245
on his way
to the Frostfangs.

325
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,880
People make
all sorts of plans.

326
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:35,350
I haven't seen Benjen Stark
in three years.

327
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:36,851
Haven't missed him.

328
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,621
Always treated me
like scum.

329
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,525
Haven't had any good wine
for a long time.

330
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,561
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

331
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,630
We're not Southerners.

332
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:50,399
Who's this little girl?

333
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:54,670
You're prettier
than half my daughters.

334
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:58,040
You got a nice wet twat
between your legs?

335
00:22:58,074 --> 00:22:59,808
What's your name?

336
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,843
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

337
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:04,712
Listen to me, bastard.

338
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:08,716
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

339
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,620
But now you're in the North,
the real North.

340
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:14,254
The lad meant no harm.

341
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:18,992
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters--

342
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:23,164
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

343
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:26,535
Now, sit down
and shut your mouth.

344
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,541
You bring any of that
good wine with you?

345
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:33,410
We did.

346
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:35,946
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

347
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,814
All six were abandoned.

348
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,917
Where have all
the wildlings gone?

349
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:44,487
I could tell you,
but I'm thirsty.

350
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,623
<i>There's a barrel of</i>
<i>Dornish wine on the sledge.</i>

351
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:49,392
- <i>Bring it in here.</i>
<i>- Yes, commander.</i>

352
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:52,595
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>where they've all gone?</i>

353
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:56,932
<i>North... to join up</i>
<i>with Mance Rayder...</i>

354
00:23:58,101 --> 00:23:59,834
Your old friend.

355
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:02,504
He's no friend of mine.

356
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:05,671
He broke his vows,
betrayed his brothers.

357
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:06,896
Oh, aye.

358
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,080
But once he was
just a poor black crow.

359
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:13,050
And now he's
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

360
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,553
He's been calling
himself that for years.

361
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:19,324
What's he king of?
A frozen lake somewhere?

362
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,761
That's a good-looking axe.

363
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,930
<i>Fresh forged?</i>

364
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,468
Give it here.

365
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,670
You'll have another one
made at Castle Black.

366
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,606
Here.

367
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,443
Oh, that's some
lovely steel.

368
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,283
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

369
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,118
Gathering an army.

370
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,387
<i>What I hear,</i>
<i>he's already got more men</i>

371
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,723
<i>than any of your</i>
<i>southern kings.</i>

372
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:53,259
And where does he plan
marching this army?

373
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:54,760
When you're
all the way north,

374
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,529
there's only
one direction to go.

375
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:03,369
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

376
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:06,706
The cold winds
are rising.

377
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,243
Let them come.
My roots are sunk deep.

378
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,746
Wife...

379
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:17,817
tell the Lord Crow
how content we are.

380
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,219
This is our place.

381
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,154
Our husband keeps us safe.

382
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:25,358
Better to live free
than die a slave.

383
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:30,630
<i>Don't it make you</i>
<i>jealous, old man,</i>

384
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:32,732
to see me with
all these young wives

385
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:36,035
and you with no one
to warm your bed?

386
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,004
We chose different paths.

387
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,475
Oh, aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

388
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:47,479
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

389
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:49,581
and eat me out of pigs.

390
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:51,517
A roof would be welcome.

391
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,085
It's been hard riding.

392
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,321
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

393
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,660
Any man lays a hand
on one of my wives,

394
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,663
he loses the hand.

395
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:10,301
And I see this one
staring too long,

396
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:13,571
I might just gouge
his eyes out.

397
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,875
Your roof, your rules.

398
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:32,158
Who am I?!

399
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:35,629
- Who am I?!
- Lord commander.

400
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,832
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

401
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:41,468
Who <i>are</i> you?

402
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:43,770
Your steward.

403
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,905
You want to lead
one day?

404
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,410
Then learn
how to follow.

405
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,666
<i>Lord of Light, come to us</i>
<i>in our darkness.</i>

406
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,404
We offer you
these false Gods.

407
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:20,373
Take them and cast
your light upon us...

408
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:26,112
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

409
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:29,648
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

410
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,551
<i>After the long summer,</i>

411
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,621
<i>darkness will fall heavy</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

412
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,357
The stars will bleed.

413
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,760
We need to stop her.

414
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:45,597
<i>The cold breath of winter</i>
<i>will freeze the seas...</i>

415
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,029
Not now.

416
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:48,254
<i>...And the dead shall rise</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

417
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:55,374
All you men were named
in the Light of the Seven!

418
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:58,544
<i>Is this how you treat</i>
<i>the Gods of your fathers?</i>

419
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:03,282
Are you so eager to spit
on your ancestors?

420
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,291
You smell of fear--

421
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,595
fear and piss
and old bones.

422
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,531
Do you want to stop me?

423
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,837
Stop me.

424
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,386
In the ancient books,
it's written

425
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:46,457
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

426
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,661
And that sword shall be
Lightbringer.

427
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:58,970
Stannis Baratheon,

428
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,572
warrior of light,

429
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,508
your sword awaits you.

430
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:37,243
Lord, cast your
light upon us!

431
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:42,114
<i>For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

432
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,420
For the night is dark
and full of terror.

433
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:19,117
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

434
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,785
Stannis is our king.

435
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,153
We follow
where he leads,

436
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,889
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

437
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,024
Since that boar
killed his brother,

438
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,093
every lord wants
a coronation.

439
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,228
I don't serve the others.
I serve Stannis.

440
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:34,965
As do I,
but loyal service

441
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,935
means telling
hard truths.

442
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:42,038
He's surrounded
by fools and fanatics,

443
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,841
but he trusts you, Davos.

444
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,978
If you tell him
the truth...

445
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,316
What's the truth?

446
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,764
<i>"And I declare upon</i>
<i>the honor of my house</i>

447
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:07,232
<i>that my beloved</i>
<i>brother Robert--"</i>

448
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,868
he wasn't
my beloved brother.

449
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:12,103
I didn't love him.
He didn't love me.

450
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:13,972
A harmless courtesy,
Your Grace.

451
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,373
A lie.
Take it out.

452
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,211
"...that my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

453
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,647
the boy Joffrey,
the boy Tommen,

454
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,849
and the girl Myrcella
being born of incest

455
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,887
<i>between Cersei Lannister and</i>
<i>her brother Jaime Lannister.</i>

456
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:30,823
- <i>By right of birth--"</i>
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

457
00:31:30,857 --> 00:31:33,659
Call him what he is.

458
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:35,194
<i>"...And her brother</i>
<i>Jaime Lannister,</i>

459
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,596
<i>the Kingslayer.</i>

00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:39,867
<i>By right of birth and blood,</i>
<i>i do this day lay claim--"</i>

461
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:43,036
<i>Make it</i> Ser <i>Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the Kingslayer.</i>

462
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:45,272
Whatever else he is,
the man's still a knight.

463
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:47,341
"Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

464
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,710
By right of birth

<i>I do this day lay claim</i>

466
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,716
Let all true men
declare their loyalty."

467
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:58,085
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

468
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,521
I'll not make
the same mistake.

469
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,590
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the Realm,

470
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:04,491
from the Arbor
to the Wall.

471
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:07,428
The time has come
to choose.

472
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:09,930
Let no man claim ignorance
as an excuse.

473
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:12,566
Your Grace,the Lannisters
are the true enemy.

474
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,635
If, for the time being, you could
make peace with your brother--

475
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,937
I'll not make peace with Renly
while he calls himself King.

476
00:32:16,972 --> 00:32:18,806
Well, many have already
declared for him--

477
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,975
Mace Tyrell,
Randyll Tarly.

478
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,245
Stannis does not need to beg
this lord or that lord for support.

479
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,847
<i>The Lord of Light</i>
<i>stands behind him.</i>

480
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:29,350
And how many ships has
the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

481
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:31,953
- He has no need for ships.
- I'm sure he doesn't,

482
00:32:31,987 --> 00:32:33,388
but we do if we're
going to war.

483
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:36,491
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

484
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:38,827
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

485
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,162
I've always served thieves
according to their desserts,

486
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:42,331
<i>as you well know,</i>
<i>Ser Davos.</i>

487
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:45,366
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark,
they're all thieves.

488
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:47,869
They'll bend the knee
or I'll destroy them.

489
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:52,473
I owe you
an apology, my King.

490
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:54,576
My duty is to serve.

491
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,679
<i>You have chosen the new God</i>
<i>over the Old Gods.</i>

492
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:02,216
<i>May the Lord of Light</i>
<i>watch over us all.</i>

493
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:04,618
Shall we drink together?

494
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:06,654
Don't.

495
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:11,493
A cup of wine to honor
the one true God.

496
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,812
The night is dark and full
of terrors, old man,

497
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:04,082
but the fire
burns them all away.

498
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,639
Your Grace.

499
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:41,688
King in the North.

500
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,425
I keep expecting you
to leave me

501
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,494
in one castle or another
for safekeeping,

502
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:51,565
but you drag me along
from camp to camp.

503
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,234
Have you grown
fond of me, Stark?

504
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:56,069
Is that it?

505
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:58,105
I've never seen you
with a girl.

506
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:01,642
If I left you with
one of my bannermen,

507
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:04,712
your father would know
within a fortnight

508
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:08,216
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message:

509
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,819
"Release my son and you'll be rich
beyond your dreams.

510
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:15,390
Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

511
00:35:15,424 --> 00:35:17,725
You don't trust
the loyalty

512
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,061
of the men following
you into battle?

513
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:23,599
Oh, I trust them
with my life,

514
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:25,634
just not with yours.

515
00:35:25,668 --> 00:35:27,502
Smart boy.

516
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:29,171
What's wrong?

517
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:31,172
<i>Don't like</i>
<i>being called "boy"?</i>

518
00:35:32,107 --> 00:35:34,142
Insulted?

519
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:43,984
<i>You insult yourself,</i>
<i>Kingslayer.</i>

520
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:49,055
<i>You've been defeated by a boy.</i>

521
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,557
<i>You're held captive</i>
<i>by a boy.</i>

522
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,262
<i>Perhaps you'll be</i>
<i>killed by a boy.</i>

523
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:04,771
Stannis Baratheon
sent ravens

524
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:08,175
to all the high lords
of Westeros.

525
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,880
King Joffrey Baratheon
is neither a true king

526
00:36:11,914 --> 00:36:14,549
<i>nor a true Baratheon.</i>

527
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,718
He's your bastard son.

528
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:19,322
<i>If that's true,</i>
<i>Stannis is the rightful king.</i>

529
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:21,390
How convenient for him.

530
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:25,694
My father learned
the truth.

531
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:27,396
That's why
you had him executed.

532
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:29,799
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

533
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,935
Your son killed him

534
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:33,403
so the world wouldn't
learn who fathered him.

535
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:37,474
And you-- you pushed
my brother from a window

536
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:39,476
because he saw you
with the queen.

537
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:47,685
You have proof?

538
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,221
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

539
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:52,424
I'm sending one of your cousins
down to King's Landing

540
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:54,093
with my peace terms.

541
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:57,163
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

542
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:59,599
You don't know him
very well.

543
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:04,003
No, but he's starting
to know me.

544
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:07,672
<i>Three victories</i>
<i>don't make you a conqueror.</i>

545
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:11,776
It's better than
three defeats.

546
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,809
<i>This city stinks...</i>

547
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:46,780
Like dead bodies.

548
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:48,948
<i>A bit corpsey, yes.</i>

549
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:51,450
And shit.

550
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,385
I thought you wanted
to come here.

551
00:37:56,722 --> 00:37:59,090
I love it.

552
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:02,794
You love the smell
of dead bodies and shit?

553
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:05,864
And cum and garlic
and rum.

554
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:09,034
You can smell cum
from the balcony?

555
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:12,405
I love the stink.
I love the noise.

556
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,541
Cities make me
want to fuck.

557
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:17,878
And so did the country.

558
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:22,482
This is where I belong.

559
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:25,385
Yes, well, you need
to be careful.

560
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:26,986
No one can know
you're here.

561
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:28,688
No one will know.

562
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:30,289
You can't trust anyone
in King's Landing.

563
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:33,492
<i>They're all liars--</i>
<i>good liars, bad liars,</i>

564
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:35,961
one or two great liars.

565
00:38:35,995 --> 00:38:37,996
What about you?

566
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,665
Me? I'm not from here.
I'm a slave to the truth.

567
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:43,501
Truth?

568
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:48,473
You are the biggest
little liar I have ever met.

569
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:50,508
Why do you think
I am so little?

570
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:55,078
I'm being crushed beneath the
weight of all that truth.

571
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:59,215
Oh!

572
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,052
Ned Stark actually
slept on this.

573
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:05,923
As if the poor man
didn't suffer enough.

574
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:11,196
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

575
00:39:22,374 --> 00:39:25,676
- Lord Baelish.
- Your Grace.

576
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:28,279
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

577
00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:29,814
Of course,
Your Grace.

578
00:39:29,848 --> 00:39:31,782
Ned Stark's youngest
daughter Arya--

579
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:34,018
we can't seem
to locate her.

580
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:36,553
If she's escaped
the capital,

581
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,655
Winterfell seems
the logical destination.

582
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:41,225
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

583
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,193
Curious.

584
00:39:43,228 --> 00:39:45,362
If we choose to negotiate
with the Starks,

585
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:47,665
the girl has some value.
Whoever finds her--

586
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,234
well, you know what they say about
Lannisters and debts.

587
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:52,270
Well, you could ask
Varys where she is.

588
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:54,606
He'll have
an answer for you.

589
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:56,208
Whether you believe it...

590
00:39:56,242 --> 00:40:00,113
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

591
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,782
Who knows what they want?

592
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,918
A mockingbird.

593
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:07,712
You created your
own Sigil, didn't you?

594
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:08,937
Yes.

595
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,791
Appropriate...
for a self-made man

596
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,559
with so many
songs to sing.

597
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:15,227
I'm glad you like it.

598
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:17,130
Some people are
fortunate enough

599
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,797
to be born into
the right family.

600
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,500
Others have to find
their own way.

601
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:24,903
I heard a song once

602
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:27,572
about a boy
of modest means

603
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:31,342
who found his way into the
home of a very prominent family.

604
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:33,144
He loved
the eldest daughter.

605
00:40:33,178 --> 00:40:36,581
Sadly, she had eyes
for another.

606
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:38,983
When boys and girls
live in the same home,

607
00:40:39,017 --> 00:40:41,652
awkward situations
can arise.

608
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:44,321
Sometimes, I've heard,
even brothers and sisters

609
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,856
develop
certain affections.

610
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:49,325
And when these affections
become common knowledge,

611
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,228
well, that is an awkward
situation indeed,

612
00:40:53,263 --> 00:40:55,564
especially
in a prominent family.

613
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:59,034
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

614
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:01,303
I've found.

615
00:41:01,337 --> 00:41:03,472
And which truth is that?

616
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:07,143
Knowledge is power.

617
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:11,715
Seize him.

618
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,553
Cut his throat.

619
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:19,157
Stop. Wait.

620
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,560
I've changed my mind.
Let him go.

621
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:26,197
Step back three paces.

622
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,001
Turn around.

623
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,702
Close your eyes.

624
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:38,343
Power is power.

625
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:41,565
Do see if you can
take some time away from

626
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,504
your coins and your whores

627
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,650
to locate
the Stark girl for me.

628
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:49,220
I would very much
appreciate it.

629
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:01,232
<i>You're Ser Alton Lannister?</i>

630
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:03,835
I am, Your Grace.

631
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:07,406
<i>I offer your cousins peace</i>
<i>if they meet my terms.</i>

632
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,743
First, your family
must release my sisters.

633
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:15,446
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

634
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,414
so he may rest beside
his brother and sister

635
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:20,184
in the crypts
beneath Winterfell.

636
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:22,387
And the remains of all those
who died in his service

637
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:24,622
must also be returned.

638
00:42:24,657 --> 00:42:27,159
Their families can honor
them with proper funerals.

639
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:30,262
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- <i>Third...</i>

640
00:42:31,932 --> 00:42:34,401
Joffrey and the Queen Regent
must renounce all claim

641
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:37,037
to dominion of the North.

642
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:39,273
From this time
till the end of time,

643
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:41,842
we are a free
and independent kingdom.

644
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:43,844
The King in the North.

645
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:46,346
King in the North.

646
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:47,948
Neither Joffrey
nor any of his men

647
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:50,217
shall set foot
in our lands again.

648
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:52,152
If he disregards
this command,

649
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:55,723
he shall suffer
the same fate as my father,

650
00:42:55,757 --> 00:43:00,060
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

651
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:03,597
These are-- Your Grace,
these are--

652
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:06,166
these are my terms.

653
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,336
If the Queen Regent and her son
meet them, I'll give them peace.

654
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,339
If not...

655
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:14,808
I will litter the south
with Lannister dead.

656
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,745
King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
Your Grace.

657
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:19,580
Oh, is he?

658
00:43:20,783 --> 00:43:24,118
You'll ride at daybreak,
Ser Alton.

659
00:43:24,153 --> 00:43:26,787
That will be all
for tonight.

660
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,671
A word, Your Grace?

661
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,175
You don't have to call me
"Your Grace" when no one's around.

662
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,912
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

663
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:52,780
I'm glad someone's
gotten used to it.

664
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:56,150
The Lannisters are going to reject
your terms, you know?

665
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:57,885
Of course they are.

666
00:43:57,919 --> 00:44:00,254
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

667
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:03,991
but we won't beat them until you
take King's Landing.

668
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:08,663
And we can't take
King's Landing without ships.

669
00:44:08,697 --> 00:44:11,332
My father has ships and men
who know how to sail them.

670
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,134
Men who fought
my father.

671
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:15,603
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

672
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:19,441
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

673
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:23,679
I'm his only living son.

674
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:26,849
He'll listen to me.
I know he will.

675
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:32,554
I'm not a Stark.
I know that.

676
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:35,558
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

677
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:39,829
We can avenge him
together.

678
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:44,100
You don't want
Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

679
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:46,402
I need his ships.
They say he has 200.

680
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:50,006
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

681
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,975
Shall we rally them
to fight for us?

682
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:53,843
I understand you don't
trust Lord Greyjoy.

683
00:44:53,878 --> 00:44:58,548
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
he is not trustworthy.

684
00:44:58,582 --> 00:45:01,217
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

685
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:05,122
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

686
00:45:05,156 --> 00:45:07,424
Before me, it was father.

687
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,125
You married one rebel
and mothered another.

688
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:12,162
I mothered more than
just rebels,

689
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:14,530
a fact you seem
to have forgotten.

690
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:16,566
If I trade the Kingslayer
for two girls,

691
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,867
my bannermen will string me up
by my feet.

692
00:45:18,902 --> 00:45:22,071
You want to leave Sansa
in the Queen's hands?

693
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:24,173
<i>And Arya--</i>

694
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:27,209
I haven't heard
a word about Arya.

695
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:28,978
What are we fighting for
if not for them?

696
00:45:29,012 --> 00:45:30,613
It's more complicated
than that!

697
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,782
You know it is.

698
00:45:47,232 --> 00:45:50,835
It's time for me
to go home.

699
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:53,771
I haven't seen Bran
or Rickon in months.

700
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,442
You can't go
to Winterfell.

701
00:45:57,476 --> 00:45:59,444
I beg your pardon?

702
00:45:59,478 --> 00:46:02,613
I'll send Rodrik
to watch over the boys

703
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:07,184
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

704
00:46:07,218 --> 00:46:09,219
Why in the name
of all the Gods--

705
00:46:09,253 --> 00:46:13,156
because I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

706
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:15,325
He's rallied
an army of 100,000.

707
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,094
You know him.
You know his family.

708
00:46:17,128 --> 00:46:19,562
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

709
00:46:19,597 --> 00:46:21,131
<i>You have a hundred</i>
<i>other lords--</i>

710
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:25,035
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

711
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:27,871
If Renly sides with us,

712
00:46:27,906 --> 00:46:30,340
we'll outnumber them
two to one.

713
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:33,310
When they feel the jaws beginning
to shut, they'll sue for peace.

714
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:36,079
We'll get the girls back.

715
00:46:36,113 --> 00:46:39,616
Then we'll all
go home... for good.

716
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:49,693
I will ride at first light.

717
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:01,938
We will all be together
again soon, I promise.

718
00:47:06,944 --> 00:47:09,545
You've done so well.

719
00:47:10,848 --> 00:47:14,717
Your father
would be... proud.

720
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,462
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- <i>King</i> Renly.

721
00:47:26,798 --> 00:47:29,567
There's a king
in every corner now.

722
00:47:42,514 --> 00:47:45,048
What is all this?

723
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:47,351
Returning this room
to its proper appearance.

724
00:47:47,385 --> 00:47:50,253
Say what you will about the Targaryens--
they were conquerors.

725
00:47:50,288 --> 00:47:53,123
That is a seat
for a conqueror.

726
00:47:53,157 --> 00:47:56,826
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

727
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,228
We can't find Arya Stark.

728
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:01,397
With luck, she's dead
in a ditch somewhere.

729
00:48:01,431 --> 00:48:03,399
Perhaps. But if not,
we need her.

730
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:05,768
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

731
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:08,404
I think they might.
They're weak.

732
00:48:08,439 --> 00:48:10,273
They put too much value
on their women.

733
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:14,143
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

734
00:48:14,178 --> 00:48:16,045
Send out as many men
as we can.

735
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,881
I'm sure if you asked
grandfather--

736
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:21,918
The King does not ask;
He commands.

737
00:48:21,952 --> 00:48:24,821
And my grandfather's
stupidity in the field of battle

738
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:27,757
is the reason Robb Stark has
Uncle Jaime in the first place.

739
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:30,492
His life is in danger.

740
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:32,161
We're at war.

741
00:48:32,195 --> 00:48:35,296
All our lives
are in danger.

742
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,803
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime.

743
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:43,471
And you.

744
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,141
Our enemies
will say anything

745
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:48,176
to weaken your claim
to the throne.

746
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:50,346
It's not a claim.
The throne is mine.

747
00:48:51,648 --> 00:48:53,750
Of course it is.

748
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,621
No one believes
this foul gossip.

749
00:48:57,655 --> 00:48:59,790
Someone believes it.

750
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:03,760
Father had
other children?

751
00:49:03,795 --> 00:49:06,330
Besides me and Tommen
and Myrcella?

752
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:10,100
What are you asking?

753
00:49:10,134 --> 00:49:12,536
I'm asking if he fucked
other women

754
00:49:12,571 --> 00:49:14,105
when he grew tired
of you.

755
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:15,940
How many bastards
does he have running--

756
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:35,925
What you just did
is punishable by death.

757
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:42,064
You will never
do it again.

758
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:44,033
Never.

759
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:52,174
That will be all,
Mother.

760
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:00,883
No, no, no, no.

761
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,720
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

762
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:05,222
Ease into it.

763
00:50:05,256 --> 00:50:08,258
Slowly, with passion.

764
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:12,029
Oh, yeah.

765
00:50:12,064 --> 00:50:15,933
Go wash yourselves.
Put some clothes on.

766
00:50:15,968 --> 00:50:18,570
Both of you
are working tonight.

767
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,308
We do things
differently here, Daisy.

768
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:28,311
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

769
00:50:28,345 --> 00:50:30,846
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

770
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:32,715
Our establishment
doesn't cater

771
00:50:32,749 --> 00:50:35,517
to ploughmen
and goat herders.

772
00:50:35,551 --> 00:50:37,652
Lord Olsen.

773
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:39,387
Taste is
everything here.

774
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:41,289
Littlefinger's
a fancy man.

775
00:50:41,323 --> 00:50:43,091
Don't call him
Littlefinger.

776
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,559
He doesn't like it.

777
00:50:44,594 --> 00:50:47,062
<i>Lord Baelish.</i>

778
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:54,837
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

779
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:57,440
so that people
will think she's exotic.

780
00:50:57,475 --> 00:51:00,377
She grew up just down the road
in flea bottom.

781
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:02,980
She's beautiful.

782
00:51:03,014 --> 00:51:06,250
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

783
00:51:11,422 --> 00:51:13,624
Lord Commander.

784
00:51:13,658 --> 00:51:16,793
Good to see you...
Again.

785
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,244
You do realize
this establishment

786
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:35,614
is owned by
Lord Petyr Baelish,

787
00:51:35,649 --> 00:51:37,816
the King's
Master of Coin...

788
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:39,785
Coin which goes
in many pockets.

789
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,522
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

790
00:51:42,556 --> 00:51:45,557
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

791
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:06,711
No, you can't.
No! Please!

792
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:09,414
No! Not my Barra!

793
00:52:09,448 --> 00:52:12,851
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

794
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:14,919
- <i>Kill the bastard.</i>
<i>- No, no!</i>

795
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:17,455
- <i>Please.</i>
- Give it here.

796
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,025
No, please.

797
00:52:29,935 --> 00:52:32,270
<i>Spread out.</i>
<i>Search every house.</i>

798
00:52:32,304 --> 00:52:34,872
<i>Every room.</i>
<i>Look in every room.</i>

799
00:52:48,253 --> 00:52:51,388
People shouting )

800
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,831
Gendry!
His name is Gendry.

801
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:03,733
Where is
the bastard?

802
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:06,369
The Night's Watch!
Please, stop!

803
00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:07,770
Where?

804
00:53:07,804 --> 00:53:10,773
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

805
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:14,409
- How will we know him?
- <i>He's got a bull's head helmet.</i>

806
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:17,678
- <i>He made it himself.</i>
- Find him.

807
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:58,441
