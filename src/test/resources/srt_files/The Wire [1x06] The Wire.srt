1
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,089
Rise and shine! Come on, man, get up!

2
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:37,188
Oh, boy. Come on, get up!
School day. Y'all gonna be late!

3
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,259
Let's go. Get up for school.

4
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,801
Go! Get up. Come on, man.

5
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,903
-Damn, Wallace.
-"Damn, Wallace," nothing!

6
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:46,496
Y'all know what happens
if you don't go to school?

7
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,168
Soon enough, they're gonna be callin'
and all y'all gonna end up in foster care.

8
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,576
If y'all want foster care,
climb your little black asses back into bed.

9
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,548
Get outta my way, man.
Damn, it's too early for this shit.

10
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,941
-Narcos?
-No, rollies.

11
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,009
Yo, where's breakfast at?

12
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,311
Here, man. You get two.

13
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,151
-I want two bags.
-You don't get two.

14
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,660
Come on, getting greedy. Take the chips!

15
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,855
Come on. Take your juice.

16
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,034
Come on, man.

17
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,800
Where's mine?

18
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,905
Go show your teacher. Come on, man.

19
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,681
-Where's your book bag?
-Teacher ain't giving no homework.

20
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,335
That's the worst case of suicide
I've ever seen.

21
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,644
That's him.

22
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,316
You see?

23
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,654
That's him, right there.

24
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,549
That's Omar's boy.

25
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:38,800
-What the fuck can I tell him?
-Whatever the man wants to hear, Jimmy.

26
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,908
Prodigal son.

27
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,972
Major, we got a good shot
at clearing a couple of cases here.

28
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,176
-One--
-We're not here to talk cases.

29
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,082
I don't care about your cases. Sit.

30
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:56,715
Relax.

31
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,849
I'm a reasonable guy.

32
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,360
In fact, everywhere I go, people say to me:

33
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:05,626
"Bill Rawls, you are a
reasonable fucking guy."

34
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,224
-Am I right, Jay?
-You are reasonable, sir.

35
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,098
Yes. Yes, I am.

36
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,371
And because your sergeant knows me
to be reasonable...

37
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,602
he came in here a couple weeks ago
and reasoned with me. Right, Jay?

38
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,575
We reasoned. We did.

39
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,445
We reasoned that
despite his negligible lrish ancestry...

40
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,282
and a propensity to talk out of turn,
Jimmy McNulty is a good worker.

41
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,855
Probably worth saving.

42
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,687
-Major, I'm not--
-He's a good-looking kid, huh?

43
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,890
Do you know what we do here, McNulty?

44
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,393
What we do here?

45
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,127
That was one of them.... What is it?
A question you don't have to--

46
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,433
A rhetorical question.

47
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,101
You were being rhetorical.
Rhetorical and reasonable, sir.

48
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,510
We work murder cases here,
as they come in, one at a fucking time.

49
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,809
It's called a rotation.

50
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,283
You're up till you catch one,
then you step down, work it for a while...

51
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,819
someone else steps up.

52
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,048
It's a simple but effective way
to do business...

53
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:07,526
in a town that has 250 to 300 cases a year.

54
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:08,919
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,396
But if someone gets it into his head
to leave the rotation...

56
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:16,401
it puts an unfair burden on other detectives
who have to pick up their casework.

57
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,698
Overworked cops make mistakes.

58
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,873
Mistakes lower the unit-wide clearance rate.

59
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,406
And that can make someone
who is otherwise as reasonable as me....

60
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,583
Unreasonable.

61
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,090
Detective McNulty, I expect to see
your ass back here next week...

62
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,789
when your shift rotates to night work.

63
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:33,111
-He's up early today.
-A lot of pager activity last night, too.

64
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,336
No woman takes that long.

65
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,216
Yeah. But I look good, right?

66
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,419
Wow. You did all this?

67
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,528
-Burned an egg or two. Ain't no thing.
-Yeah?

68
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,961
My mama always said:
"Don't let them get to cooking.

69
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,060
"Once they're in the kitchen, ain't nothing
left to do but give 'em a key to your house."

70
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,731
I don't want no key. I don't want no house.

71
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,309
And your mama don't know shit about me.

72
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,506
Looks just like you.

73
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,706
Yeah, he do.

74
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,574
Where's his mother?

75
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,414
Around the way.

76
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,950
Yeah. You friends?

77
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,191
You know, she want a key...

78
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,791
she want a house, she want a car,
she wants some new clothes, a necklace...

79
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:01,459
some pocket change, a trip to the shore,
she want a credit card with her name on it.

80
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,695
Ain't no such thing as free, right?

81
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:06,602
When it come to pussy, there ain't no free.

82
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,441
I gotta go.

83
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,754
Been working on this one.

84
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,061
You'll get the lines
on the other two payphones tomorrow.

85
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,000
-So we up?
-On the low-rise payphones, yeah.

86
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,537
Let's hear it.

87
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:44,233
See, what I'm talking about is he ain't
paid no one, hejust think it's right to do it.

88
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,772
See how it goes?
So I ain't got shit. I ain't got it.

89
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,306
Damn, for real?

90
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,585
Thinking he all that
because he got his family back.

91
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,955
-Hey, it was getting good.
-It's unmonitored.

92
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,047
It's what?

93
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,890
Unmonitored. We can't listen to a
conversation on an unmonitored payphone.

94
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,295
-What's that mean?
-We got a tap on the courtyard payphone.

95
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,960
By tomorrow,
we'll be up on two near the high-rises.

96
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:13,267
But we can't listen to anything unless we
know one of our targets is using the phone.

97
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,864
So we gotta be out there
on those rooftops for hours...

98
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,137
watching these assholes talk on the phone?

99
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,371
Yep.

100
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,042
It's more bullshit.

101
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:26,017
Detective, this right here, this is the job.

102
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,587
Now, when you came downtown to CID,
what kind of work were you expecting?

103
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,659
So what are you gonna do?

104
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,060
I can't get back here in a week,
this case is taking off.

105
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,526
You tell Rawls that?

106
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,631
-No.
-McNulty, Line 3.

107
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,864
Yeah?

108
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,304
Where at?

109
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,045
800 block, in the rear. Yeah, I got it.

110
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,844
Thanks. Yeah.

111
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:34,420
We're still waiting on a lab unit.
Do you have an ETA?

112
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,455
Negative. They're all out.

113
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,121
-Damn dog got Norris, too.
-You didn't think to warn me?

114
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,923
Too much fun not to.

115
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,657
Damn.

116
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,334
Is he one of yours?

117
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,461
We found him with Kevlar,
like the one Worden caught last week.

118
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,165
-We thought it might be a connection.
-Yeah, it connects.

119
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,332
How so?

120
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:56,777
Don't have a name,
but he's part of a stick-up crew.

121
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,007
Don't have a name,
but he's part of a stick-up crew.

122
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,878
Took off a stash house last month.
My guy, Barksdale, is coming back on them.

123
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,851
-In a big way.
-They must've killed him four or five times.

124
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,946
Cut him in a dozen places, burned him
with cigarettes. Torture-fest is what it was.

125
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,719
Doesn't look like your scene, either.

126
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,920
Fuck him up somewhere else,
dump him here for all to see.

127
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,259
-Anything we can use?
-Not yet.

128
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,664
We're up on some phones.
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

129
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,601
-Bring 22.
-22.

130
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:27,902
Anything yet? Or are we just gonna let
this guy go ripe on us?

131
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,871
-You been waiting for crime lab?
-Over an hour.

132
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,879
Only two units on the street. Both are up
at the City Council President's house.

133
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,007
-What happened there?
-Someone stole his lawn furniture.

134
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:42,578
They're taking pictures of an empty patio,
dusting the backyard gate for latents.

135
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,986
I kid you not.

136
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,886
I swear, you show me the son of a bitch
who can fix this police department...

137
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,689
I'd give back half my overtime.

138
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:51,988
He was all cut up and shit.

139
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,193
His insides was hanging out.

140
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,970
Fucked up, yo. I mean, damn.

141
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,330
Sometimes you gotta send a message, yo.

142
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:06,305
I mean, when you picked up that phone,
what did you think they were gonna do?

143
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,940
-All that shit is in the game. You know that.
-Yeah.

144
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,847
Like you and that girl, huh?

145
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,384
-What girl?
-The one in the apartment.

146
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:17,656
The one you told us about, remember?

147
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,761
I mean, I like what you said
about all that killing, you know?

148
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,297
Especially that part about
how it ain't gotta be like that.

149
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,056
Just sell the shit and move on.

150
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,658
Get me a ginger ale
and get something for yourself.

151
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,531
Yeah, I remember that.
But it ain't like that, is it?

152
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,972
Yeah, I know. I know it ain't.

153
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,637
Thing about it was his eye.
His eye was blown out.

154
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,739
And the other one was open.
And yo, Dee, it fucks me up.

155
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,217
It's like he's looking out,
like he sees everything, you know?

156
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,319
Don't think about it.

157
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,860
-Fuck!
-Yo.

158
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,725
Let that shit go.

159
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,623
Just let it go.

160
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,482
Barksdale kid on the line.

161
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,619
He's beeping someone.

162
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,847
-Yo.
-What up?

163
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,885
Hold on.

164
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,792
Yo, Strings! This is Dee.

165
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,526
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you hit me?

166
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:12,901
Yeah, I wanted to know ifyou know a
young hopper, the one they got down there.

167
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,400
-Which one?
-The fool, drop in there with a punch.

168
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,740
-Yeah, what about him?
-He got some problems, right?

169
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,910
-What you mean?
-Enough to bring home, right?

170
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,082
You know, man, whatever.

171
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,548
All right.

172
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,234
They're bringing Bodie home.

173
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,743
A young boy who was with him,
light-skinned kid from the cemetery.

174
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:01,843
Where?

175
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,152
In the alley behind 800 block of Argyle,
across from the low-rises.

176
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,247
Shot?

177
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,824
-Stabbed, beaten, burned.
-Jesus.

178
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:10,954
-Yeah, we gotta get with Omar.
-Yeah.

179
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,905
Impressive.

180
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:28,647
I don't often see a respondent come so
prepared for a juvenile commitment meeting.

181
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,717
In addition to the signed statements
from Preston's sponsors...

182
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,683
at the Police Athletic League...

183
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,915
I also have a Photostatted copy
of a cashed check...

184
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,617
which indicates that he is enrolled
in the GED program...

185
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,024
at the Baltimore City Community College.

186
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,892
Can I ask how this young man is able
to afford not one...

187
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:52,062
-but two attorneys from your firm, Mr. Levy?
-This is pro bono, Your Honor.

188
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,539
My firm is making it a priority to identify
a number of city youths...

189
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,908
who are in crisis, and to undertake efforts
to reorder their lives.

190
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:04,378
Excuse me, I can't help but notice that
your client is under a delinquent petition...

191
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:08,045
for the sale of narcotics, and further,
for assault on a police officer.

192
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,748
Beyond that,
he walked away from a JSA facility.

193
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,121
You Honor, my client stands
ready to acknowledge...

194
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:17,094
that he was involved for a time
in the sale of a small amount of drugs...

195
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,859
a transaction for which
he received no remuneration...

196
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,800
having been manipulated
by older traffickers in his neighborhood.

197
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,838
-That was a mistake, Your Honor.
-So noted.

198
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:31,567
We will contend that it was Preston who
was the victim of a brutal police beating...

199
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,511
indications of which
are still evident on him, Your Honor.

200
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:38,072
He struck back,
wildly and in self-defense, Your Honor.

201
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,511
And the walk-away?

202
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,077
Preston was heavily medicated
when he left the Cheltenham facility.

203
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,020
In that state, Your Honor...

204
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,652
he was simply trying to get back
to see his grandmother.

205
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,294
Did you know what you were doing
when you left the Boys' Village, son?

206
00:18:56,102 --> 00:19:00,198
-No, I was messed up.
-Anything else you'd like to add?

207
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,468
Just...

208
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,468
I don't know...

209
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,442
I'm ready to be good.

210
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,952
Pending a hearing on these charges
to be scheduled within six months...

211
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:18,183
I'm putting the respondent
on home monitoring with his grandmother.

212
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:22,057
Your honor, I'm afraid Mrs. Brodus
doesn't have a telephone...

213
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,491
for any monitoring calls.
She's on a fixed income, Your Honor.

214
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:29,329
How about he calls his probation officer
twice a week?

215
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,361
Cool. Whatever...

216
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,705
Your Honor.

217
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,870
-Yo, Bubbles, what's the game?
-Hey, Johnny.

218
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:07,073
-Rubbing them down, huh?
-Yeah.

219
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,836
-Rubbing them down, huh?
-Yeah.

220
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,375
-What is the scam out here?
-Ain't no scam.

221
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,044
Thank you, ma'am.

222
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,341
What you got here is an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay. Right, Lavelle?

223
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,421
Mr. Straight Time, Bubbles.

224
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,355
Gotta give something back
when they least expect it.

225
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,359
Me and Uck, here, we got something on, too.
We got a plan.

226
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,829
-No shit.
-For real.

227
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,065
Yo, we're gonna take off
on the copper house.

228
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,971
Damn, your first two days out
and you get dramatic on me.

229
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,101
-Copper house.
-Got to be got, homes.

230
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,771
-What about the fence?
-Fuck the fence.

231
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,847
-What about the dog?
-Fuck the dog.

232
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,545
All that time I was resting,
it got me thinking. It got good to me, too.

233
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,287
Copper house. Gracious.

234
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,053
I gotta go, can you cash me out?

235
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,229
If you ain't got dreams, Bubs,
what the fuck you got?

236
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,095
Thank you. Come on, dreamer.

237
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,261
Yeah.

238
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,996
-One of ours on the line.
-Got him.

239
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,659
-Is Carv still there?
-Hold a second.

240
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,769
Carv, call for you!

241
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,698
-Yeah, hello?
-You ain't gonna believe who I'm looking at.

242
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,231
Again he walks off?

243
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,104
Ding! Round three.

244
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,347
-Yo.
-What up, man?

245
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,323
-Yo, Stink, what up?
-Where are your manners, fool?

246
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,886
-Oh, my bad, yeah.
-You need to keep your fucking head, boy.

247
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,122
Forgot.

248
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:18,328
-What's up? Where you at?
-Where you at?

249
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,235
I'm down in the Pit. Ijust came home...

250
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,641
I don't see nobody around,
ljust wanted to know what was up.

251
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,773
Ain't nothing going late, man.

252
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,075
Just catch us tomorrow, man.

253
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,615
-All right?
-All right, yeah.

254
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,519
All right. Later.

255
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,392
"Non-pertinent"?

256
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,694
How do you log that non-pertinent?

257
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,232
No drug talk.

258
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,300
They use codes
that hide their pager and phone numbers.

259
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:56,298
And when someone does use a phone,
they don't use names.

260
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,705
And if someone does use a name,
he's reminded not to.

261
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:02,043
All of that is valuable evidence.

262
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,213
-Of what?
-Conspiracy.

263
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:08,685
Conspiracy?

264
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,492
We're building something here, detective.
We're building it from scratch.

265
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:16,794
All the pieces matter.

266
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,455
All right?

267
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:32,069
Shit.

268
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,417
Shit!

269
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,117
Are you fucking serious?

270
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,511
Fuck, man.

271
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:43,752
You keep walking away from JSA,
we keep kicking your ass.

272
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:47,520
-I'm all right with that if you are.
-I ain't walk away from nowhere, man.

273
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,391
Check my back pocket.

274
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,765
-"Home monitoring"?
-Yeah, man.

275
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:05,436
If you ask questions before you start wildin'
on niggers, you might save some trouble.

276
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,240
How the fuck are you home?

277
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,871
You ain't bright, man.

278
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:10,711
Juvenile judge, man.

279
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:13,752
He saw my potential.
He expects big things from me.

280
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:15,116
Yeah, like what?

281
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,052
I don't know, college, law school,
medical school, all that good shit.

282
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,617
-Seriously, how are you out?
-Look, I'm gonna tell you something.

283
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,890
Okay, this is just my opinion, but...

284
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,895
the juvenile system in this city is fucked up.
It's a big-ass fucking joke. No offense.

285
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,597
Fucking fuck!

286
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,307
You could give me a ride down
to my grandma's, we'll call it even.

287
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:43,914
In back, fucknuts.

288
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,592
Get outta the street!

289
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:31,987
Bitch!

290
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,804
-Hey.
-Hey.

291
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,641
What's up? What you need?

292
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,681
-Little late in the month for this shit, isn't it?
-What you mean?

293
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:59,823
-For my aunt, she hit the Match Four.
-You stealing from me, Cass?

294
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,566
What?

295
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:19,874
You look fresh today.

296
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,314
-Got laid last night, that's why.
-Oh, yeah? Your asshole still hurting?

297
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,113
-Call Jimmy.
-What's up, boss?

298
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:33,290
Rawls finally got around to reading the
office reports that McNulty tried to give him.

299
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,987
He wants arrest warrants
for Diedre Kresson...

300
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,497
and the two project murders
that match up to that gun.

301
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:41,995
I know.

302
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:47,206
-Come on, Jay, be right on this.
-I can't. It's Rawls, he wants warrants today.

303
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:50,944
All right, no problem. So who the fuck
are we supposed to charge?

304
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:53,908
You got a witness
that puts D'Angelo Barksdale...

305
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:56,744
at the scene of the murder,
the night of the murder.

306
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,616
You got a ballistics match between
the Kresson girl and the two dead mopes...

307
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,883
in the project where Barksdale hangs.
Run with it.

308
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:07,085
This weak-ass shit
is not gonna get past the Grand Jury.

309
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:09,719
Charge the mope,
and work it more afterward.

310
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:13,923
Call Jimmy, let him know.

311
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:18,262
Yo.

312
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,271
All right, listen up. New deal.

313
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:28,779
Wallace, you're gonna be on the stash now
with Latroy and Peaches.

314
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:30,247
What about Sterling?

315
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,751
He's gonna be down on Crescent,
looking out for a while. Cassandra, too.

316
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:35,549
-What happened?
-Nothing.

317
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:39,591
-Why you wanna change up, then?
-Nigger, I gotta explain shit to you now?

318
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,658
Stringer Bell's pager number?

319
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:51,398
-Stinkum's too, I'm pretty sure.
-Very sweet.

320
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:54,901
If they moved around,
then nobody would have problems.

321
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,771
They're a little lazy, you know...

322
00:27:57,544 --> 00:28:01,503
tend to go to that one payphone
in the courtyard a little too much.

323
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,040
Jesus.

324
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,087
He's lit at 9:00 in the morning?

325
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,820
Or from the night before.

326
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:19,562
Detective.

327
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,535
Detective Polk.

328
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,947
Yeah, it's McNulty. Bunk paged me.

329
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:38,977
All right.

330
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:50,663
Why did you even come in today?

331
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:54,361
-I had some....
-To pretend that you were here?

332
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,601
To fill out a run sheet?

333
00:28:57,604 --> 00:29:00,232
I know I missed a couple of days
last week, Lieutenant, but--

334
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,275
I got a run sheet from you every day
for the last two weeks.

335
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:07,437
Twice in Carv's handwriting,
twice it was Prez, once it was McNulty.

336
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,080
They covered for you.

337
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,976
But I won't.

338
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,379
Well, Lieutenant, l....

339
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:22,527
I don't know. I'm not really
up for this drug thing, you know?

340
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,563
Maybe if Mahone was here, I could...

341
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:28,160
get into it more, learn some new tricks.

342
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:35,830
Hell, why don't you just send me back
to Property and keep everyone happy?

343
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,309
Send you back to Property Crimes
so you can binge for two more weeks?

344
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:40,709
I'm not doing that.

345
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,711
-Lieutenant, please--
-You were dumped on me, Augie.

346
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,085
But it ends there. I don't dump people.

347
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:52,519
You either go out on those rooftops today
to watch payphones with the others...

348
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,561
or you go over to the medical office
and check yourself in.

349
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,590
-Medical?
-For alcohol abuse.

350
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,431
Either dry yourself out
or go up on those rooftops wet.

351
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:13,645
Take a few minutes and think on it.

352
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,788
-Where'd they go?
-Who?

353
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,462
Lieutenant...

354
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:35,390
we need a file cabinet or two.
The paperwork from this, I mean...

355
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,431
there's a lot of it.

356
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:39,533
Lieutenant...

357
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,199
sir...

358
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:45,134
I'm going to....

359
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,742
Good luck with the case.

360
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,693
Fucking Rawls,
he's fucking up the case to get to me.

361
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:06,164
No, he's fucking it up for three paper
clearances on prior cases. It ain't personal.

362
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,791
All he's got is D'Angelo
at the scene through hearsay...

363
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:12,736
and a ballistics match to a couple unrelated
drug murders. How can he charge that?

364
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,535
He can charge anything he wants
to get credit for clearance.

365
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:18,440
Grand Jury doesn't indict,
he drops the case, keeps his stats.

366
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,105
-I'll go tell him what the fuck he can do.
-No you don't.

367
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:24,911
I'm trying to build something here.
Rawls just sticks a finger in my eye.

368
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:27,282
-You talk to Landsman?
-Jay can't fix this.

369
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:30,479
Rawls told him to have the warrants typed
and ready by morning.

370
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,957
He's gonna charge murders he can't prove
just to get the stats?

371
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,550
And fuck up our case in the process.

372
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:38,597
We give up ballistics info and motive
for the Kresson killing...

373
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:41,724
in the charging documents,
and Avon Barksdale is gonna change up.

374
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:45,100
And what he don't change up he'll clean up.
Someone should tell Rawls.

375
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:48,436
Rawls couldn't care less.
He wants me home, and the stats, that's all.

376
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,338
-Then we take it to Daniels.
-Daniels?

377
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,911
-It's his case, he'll fight for it.
-He won't do shit.

378
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,446
He plays stiff every now and then,
but he's a good man.

379
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:56,913
Are you kidding me?

380
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:59,541
He's been trying to put the brakes on this
for weeks now.

381
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,779
This'll be his new excuse to close shop.

382
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:04,948
Look, you guys gotta make your move soon,
I'm sorry to say.

383
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,890
-Freamon.
-All right, Bunk, take care.

384
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:10,655
We tell Daniels.

385
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,995
Fuck Daniels and his ass-kissing
up-the-chain-of-command ambition.

386
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,863
What other choice you got, huh?

387
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:18,660
We go to Daniels. If he fights, he fights.

388
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:22,765
If he gives it up to Rawls, then fuck it,
we were never gonna do the case anyway.

389
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:26,945
All right, come on.

390
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:04,213
Fucking idiot!

391
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,154
-Come on, get up, stupid.
-I'm hurt, man.

392
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:12,747
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

393
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:15,256
-What, are you on dope or something?
-Mostly, yes.

394
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,919
Come on, get up.

395
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:20,430
You trying to rip out my guts?

396
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,728
-Fuck.
-What, are you trying to kill me, man?

397
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:26,135
-Wait! Where are you going?
-Listen, I gotta get help.

398
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,571
You can't leave me here.
You gotta stay with me.

399
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,267
Let's go over to the curb.

400
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,573
Just go get help, man! What are you doing?

401
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,147
Stay there!

402
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,708
-Damn, boy! What the hell come out of you?
-Onion soup. Campbell's.

403
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,721
-Yeah, my plan!
-Run, Forrest, run!

404
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,953
You could go to Foerster,
or the Deputy Ops.

405
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:52,192
Why come crying to me?

406
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:54,033
Why not go to your friend, the judge?

407
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:56,894
I don't see a circuit court judge
being able to argue...

408
00:33:57,003 --> 00:33:59,471
the city homicide commander
out of three murders...

409
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:03,866
even if the cases are all weak sisters.
It's put-up or shut-up time, Lieutenant.

410
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:07,208
-Either you step up or you send us all home.
-So this is on me?

411
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,747
I don't see anyone else
in charge of this detail.

412
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:14,152
-Rawls is a major.
-Rawls is an asshole.

413
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:17,312
My point is, he ranks me on this.

414
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:22,456
Chain of command might mean
nothing to you, McNulty.

415
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,767
What'd I tell you?

416
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,867
-Yo, how we doing?
-We doing good.

417
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:42,397
You know, if you say we doing good....

418
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:48,413
So the word is out
about these stick-up boys, right?

419
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,539
Yeah, y'all being heard.

420
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,349
There goes shorty right there.

421
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:59,857
What's up, man, you know...

422
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,918
I'm a man of my word.
I said it would be $4,000 to Omar...

423
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:07,721
$2,000 on each of the young ones,
this being a team effort.

424
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:11,036
I'm putting $500 in the boy's hand
who's doing the scope...

425
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:13,765
$500 in your hand for doing the relay...

426
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:17,536
put $500 in Wee-Bey and Bird's hands
for doing the muscling up.

427
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:22,073
-All right.
-How you doing with that other thing?

428
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:23,404
What?

429
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:26,645
Everybody a little depressed, right?

430
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,745
Oh, yeah, you know, ain't no surprises yet.

431
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,382
Cut everybody loose on Friday...

432
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:35,256
and they all just a bunch
of begging-ass bitches.

433
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:37,395
I mean, ain't nobody showed
no money since.

434
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:39,897
-You gonna keep it humming, cuz?
-Yeah, you know.

435
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,633
Oh! You got your hands up.

436
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:47,302
You keep on doing like how you're doing
we'll talk about points on the package.

437
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,402
-All right?
-All right.

438
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,244
-Keep it humming.
-Yeah, most def.

439
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:58,316
-All right, then.
-Take it light, but take it.

440
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:08,020
Hotter than the Wu-Tang, killer bee.

441
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:35,443
-40 cents.
-Not 40 cents a foot, no sir.

442
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,416
Look, respectfully, I gotta tell you...

443
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:41,459
for 40 cents a foot, you might as well
go to Home Depot, pay them.

444
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:44,724
They're gonna charge you
45 or 50 cents a foot.

445
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:46,662
For copper that isn't stolen.

446
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,592
Look, all right, 35 cents a foot.

447
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:54,503
And that's in respect I have for y'all,
what you're doing in our community...

448
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,905
with these quality domiciles here.

449
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,903
Thirty cents a foot, take it or leave it.

450
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:08,316
I understand the interest
in clearing these cases, I do.

451
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,784
But charging those murders now...

452
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,656
and putting the information that we have
into the charging documents....

453
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,888
I just call them like I see them, Lieutenant.

454
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:21,524
Three murders, same gun, we got this
Barksdale kid right at the scene on the one.

455
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:25,195
We're up on the wire.
We're starting to pull good information.

456
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:28,832
You charge these prematurely
and Barksdale will change up on us.

457
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:31,171
-The work we've already done--
-Look...

458
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:34,610
I can't tell you how to run your case,
I can only run my own.

459
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:35,874
Major...

460
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:40,351
I'm asking as a favor.

461
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:44,155
-As a favor.
-Yes, sir.

462
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:45,513
A favor.

463
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:46,851
In that case...

464
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:51,253
no. Sorry.

465
00:38:56,736 --> 00:39:00,433
-You got home from work early today.
-Yep. Work sucks.

466
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:04,236
-Are we eating dinner with you?
-Why not?

467
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:09,677
-You promised we'd eat lasagna.
-So we'll go to Little ltaly.

468
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,477
Get some lasagna at Sab's.

469
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:14,910
-You never cook.
-Yeah, cooking sucks, too.

470
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:35,336
-Who's this?
-Hey, yo, I wanna see him.

471
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,743
-Who?
-Brandon, my boy.

472
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,518
-Copper house, yo.
-Was the shit.

473
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:00,693
My plan, Bubs.

474
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:03,233
Johnny had a plan.

475
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,271
Get out the way, motherfuckers.

476
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:09,807
This here is White Boy Day.

477
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,242
-I got a plan, too.
-What?

478
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:18,645
We're gonna wait for that cheap-ass,
speculating motherfucker...

479
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:23,852
to put that good copper line
back into them row houses he's fixing up.

480
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:27,792
Then, before the drywall get up...

481
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:32,660
we creep back in there,
and steal that shit right back.

482
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,124
30 cents a foot.

483
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,766
Gotta come back at the motherfucker
for that, you know?

484
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,198
Yeah.

485
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,140
You good?

486
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:50,539
I could top off with one more.

487
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,413
-Yeah.
-Just one more.

488
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,126
Johnny got it.

489
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,228
I'll be back.

490
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,055
It's my night with the kids.

491
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,006
You ain't gonna find nothing,
because I didn't do nothing!

492
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:52,100
Why don't you just leave me alone, man?

493
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:55,703
A white man can't walk down the street?
What's that about? Come on, man!

494
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:58,910
It's messed up, all right?

495
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,743
Profiling!

496
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:04,414
What? It's 'cause I'm white, right?
Why don't you let me....

497
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:08,152
Oh, man, what the fuck's that? What's that?

498
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:13,757
That boy ain't got no luck.

499
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:28,840
All right. Hold up!

500
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:40,116
-Hey.
-Hey.

501
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:46,058
So, what are you going to do
with your money?

502
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:48,927
You know what you should do?

503
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:51,765
Take the whole roll
and do something nice for your girl.

504
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:53,839
You do have a girl, right?

505
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:59,137
Anyway, you've got enough money
to go get yourself one now.

506
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:04,940
Why'd you punk Sterling like you did?

507
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:07,448
I mean, he did get shot behind this shit.

508
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:10,885
-I didn't punk him.
-So why are you dropping the lookout?

509
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,818
Cass, too.

510
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:16,161
'Cause they was thieving. Both of them.

511
00:43:17,363 --> 00:43:19,297
They got pissed
'cause I wasn't paying them.

512
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:22,629
So Sterling started shaking up the vials,
handing off to Cass.

513
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:24,828
She was selling on the side.

514
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:28,573
You didn't tell anybody? Stinkum, Bodie?

515
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:30,600
They don't know?

516
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:33,269
If I tell them,
what you think they're going to do?

517
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:37,010
They're going to take a baseball bat
to Sterling. Cassandra, too.

518
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:39,817
It's too much drama, right?

519
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:42,720
So, I just took them both off the stash.

520
00:43:42,822 --> 00:43:44,619
So why didn't you pay us?

521
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,186
That wasn't right.

522
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,095
Listen, man...

523
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:54,630
Stringer thought we had a snitch down here.

524
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:57,998
You know, with the jump-out,
Omar, all that shit.

525
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:01,365
So he told me to punk you all
for a little while.

526
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:04,102
See who was still holding money
at the end of the week.

527
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,802
Was they snitching?

528
00:44:06,212 --> 00:44:07,440
Sterling and Cass?

529
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:10,578
No, man, just thieving.

530
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:18,680
2-0, Orioles, in the first inning.

531
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:21,055
All right, going to Homicide.

532
00:44:21,427 --> 00:44:24,123
Okay, you two, you sit right here, okay?

533
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,822
Don't wander off.

534
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,293
-Dad?
-What?

535
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:32,131
It's a school night. Mom said we had to--

536
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:35,036
I know, I know. We will. Just stay there.

537
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:38,868
Runners at second and third,
nobody out yet here in the first inning.

538
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:43,043
Here's Mora at the plate,
and the pitch is high.

539
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:47,409
Lopez on the mound. The pitch is outside.

540
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,178
15 pitches and 10 of them have been balls.

541
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:06,095
It's a ground ball down the right-field line.

542
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:38,428
64-Charlie to Central K.

543
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:43,998
You up to this?

544
00:45:46,345 --> 00:45:48,836
Pay it back, Omar. Pay it back.

545
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,402
Why we ain't in a real police office?

546
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,272
We're a little like you, Omar.

547
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:26,681
Out here on our own,
playing the game for ourselves.

548
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:34,223
Hard way to go sometimes.

549
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:39,828
Sorry about your friend.

550
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:43,235
Avon is one sick bastard.

551
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:46,264
Of course, he had his reasons.

552
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:48,602
For one thing, you all did take his stash.

553
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:51,267
For another, he's looking for you, Omar.

554
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,140
That's what all the cigarette burns
were about.

555
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:56,908
The broken fingers and cracked forearms.

556
00:46:58,617 --> 00:47:00,414
He wanted your boy to give you up.

557
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,248
An address, a street.

558
00:47:03,522 --> 00:47:05,012
Kid had heart.

559
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:06,982
Yeah.

560
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:12,093
I know you want to go to
wherever it is you lay your head...

561
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:15,598
and pick up that sawed-off you like
so much, and go on the hunt.

562
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:18,497
That's how a man like you wants to carry.

563
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:21,232
-You wouldn't be wrong.
-No, you wouldn't.

564
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,309
But one man with two barrels
ain't enough, Omar.

565
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,106
Now, you're going to do
what you're going to do.

566
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:31,114
But whatever else you can give us
on Barksdale and his people...

567
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,477
that can go to hurting him, too.

568
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,877
Just throw us what you can.

569
00:47:37,156 --> 00:47:39,852
Let me tell you all something, all right?

570
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:43,651
What I do, I do, straight like that.

571
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:46,627
Ain't no sense
in you all troubling yourselves over that...

572
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:49,496
'cause the way I feel right now, today....

573
00:47:57,443 --> 00:47:59,536
What do you all need from me?

574
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,775
When did you last see Brandon?

575
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,817
Tuesday around 7:00. Maybe later.

576
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,154
He was on his way down to Mindamin...

577
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:12,746
and the Greek's after that.

578
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:15,520
Everybody's talking about
he got snatched up from there.

579
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:17,561
The Greek's on Baltimore Street?

580
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,655
Yeah, he liked to play
the pinball games to death.

581
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:22,199
He go alone?

582
00:48:22,935 --> 00:48:25,403
Yeah, and I didn't like it none, neither.

583
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:30,603
But you can only treat a young man
like a boy for so long before they book.

584
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:32,308
When Bailey got killed...

585
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:35,005
you must have figured
Barksdale was coming back on you?

586
00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:36,445
Bailey? Please.

587
00:48:36,548 --> 00:48:38,641
That nigger's enemies got enemies.

588
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:42,453
I just figured he tried his hand
on the wrong corner and got dropped.

589
00:48:42,554 --> 00:48:45,216
But you were worried about Brandon, right?

590
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:46,989
Look, in my game...

591
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:50,084
you take some kid,
you play it the safest way you can.

592
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:52,730
But it ain't about no hiding forever.

593
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,190
You heard?

594
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:56,631
Frankly, you been in it as long as me...

595
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:58,396
you do the thing on your name.

596
00:48:58,604 --> 00:49:01,937
Anyone going to come after Omar,
they know Omar's coming after him.

597
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,371
Oh, indeed.

598
00:49:04,543 --> 00:49:06,602
So, who came after Brandon?

599
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:09,911
I heard it might have been Wee-Bey...

600
00:49:10,716 --> 00:49:12,206
his boy Stinkum...

601
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:14,012
and Bird.

602
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:16,449
He was down with the snatch, too.

603
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,452
So, what can you give us on the job?

604
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:29,597
7:56 Tuesday night,
you had an incoming call...

605
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:32,602
to D'Angelo Barksdale's,
giving him the number of a pay phone.

606
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:35,366
Westside exchange.
Number's encoded, right?

607
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:40,771
Three minutes later, we get another call
from the low-rises to that number.

608
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:44,110
Then, a half-minute later,
you get another call from the low-rises...

609
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:46,150
to a pager we know is Stringer Bell's.

610
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:47,240
I'll be damned.

611
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,616
Finally, you get another call.

612
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:53,386
Probably from a pay phone.
Probably Stringer Bell calling back.

613
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:55,619
Coming on into the low-rise courts.

614
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:59,185
Forty-five minutes later, another call.

615
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:03,060
This one from the same pay phone
that went to D'Angelo's pager...

616
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:05,329
to start the whole thing off. You see that?

617
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:06,927
This is the murder, right here.

618
00:50:07,072 --> 00:50:10,599
This first number,
the one they sent to D'Angelo...

619
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,839
I'm thinking this comes from a pay phone
over by the Greek's.

620
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:24,649
He's on you.

621
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,724
We're up on those pay phones
Tuesday night...

622
00:50:26,825 --> 00:50:29,191
we catch that murder.
We get there before the murder.

623
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:30,693
It's all here on the pen register.

624
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:33,822
This one calling that one,
that one calling back.

625
00:50:33,932 --> 00:50:37,129
We're up on those pay phones
when we should be, and we have him cold.

626
00:50:37,236 --> 00:50:38,999
But we're not up in time, are we?

627
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,766
In this case,
we're never where we need to be.

628
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:55,348
Bad time for you all?

629
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:12,060
He fight, but you arrest.

630
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:14,402
You saw him get arrested?

631
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:17,139
-On Tuesday?
-Tuesday, yes. Tuesday.

632
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:19,836
By the police? The police arrested him?

633
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:22,279
Cops, they handcuffed him?

634
00:51:24,783 --> 00:51:26,614
What about these guys?

635
00:51:26,852 --> 00:51:28,683
Were they there with him?

636
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:29,776
No.

637
00:51:33,692 --> 00:51:35,853
-He fight, you arrest.
-Right.

638
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:39,327
Okay, thank you, sir. Thank you.

639
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:48,004
It's a match.

640
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:51,066
No.

641
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:54,177
I need help. Rawls ranks me.

642
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:57,248
Lieutenant, think what you're doing here.

643
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:00,482
You're going to cross Bill Rawls...

644
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:03,914
as ruthless a fuck
as we have in this department?

645
00:52:04,756 --> 00:52:06,383
And to do what?

646
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:11,026
To fight for a case the Deputy of Operations
doesn't even want.

647
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:14,055
No.

648
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:17,161
I like my career, thank you very much.

649
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:25,038
In the cemetery, you were telling us that
a guy named Bird killed the working man.

650
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:28,038
Yeah, the man who testified.

651
00:52:28,714 --> 00:52:30,477
William Gant. Right.

652
00:52:30,682 --> 00:52:32,912
Yeah, Bird did that one, for sure.

653
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:35,680
-How do you know?
-Everybody knows, man.

654
00:52:35,787 --> 00:52:38,415
Nigger walked up behind the man
and shot him in the head.

655
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:40,753
The whole blessed project saw that much.

656
00:52:41,193 --> 00:52:42,751
And Bird worked for Avon?

657
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:44,920
Yeah, as one of his shooters.

658
00:52:45,063 --> 00:52:46,928
Liked to use this real sweet gun he got.

659
00:52:47,032 --> 00:52:50,126
A .380 from Austria or Australia.
Something like that.

660
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:52,066
But I know he loved that gun.

661
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,137
A .380.

662
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,738
Yeah, a .380. You get him, you get the gun.

663
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:58,901
'Cause Bird's too dumb
to throw a gun like that off.

664
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:01,611
-A gun alone ain't enough.
-Oh, no?

665
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:04,807
He testifies he bought the gun on the street
after Gant was killed.

666
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,441
-What would be enough, then?
-Eyeball witness.

667
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:10,919
Some kind of corroboration
for what you're telling me here.

668
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:16,851
-Okay.
-Okay, what?

669
00:53:17,396 --> 00:53:19,887
-I'm your man.
-You saw the murder?

670
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:21,623
Yeah.

671
00:53:22,234 --> 00:53:25,931
You can ID this man, Bird,
as the shooter of William Gant?

672
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:29,032
And you ain't afraid to go into court...

673
00:53:29,141 --> 00:53:31,803
and testify against
one of Barksdale's people?

674
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,176
Omar don't scare.

675
00:53:37,616 --> 00:53:41,484
The fact is that while Lt. Daniels
and his merry band are lost in the swamps...

676
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:44,521
playing with beepers and pay phones
and body mikes...

677
00:53:44,623 --> 00:53:48,320
my people have developed information
that ties Barksdale to three killings.

678
00:53:48,427 --> 00:53:52,090
-D'Angelo Barksdale, not Avon.
-D'Angelo on behalf of Avon.

679
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:56,900
The victim is identified by our witnesses
as being involved with Avon Barksdale.

680
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:58,962
Sir, we're developing--

681
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:01,437
You're dancing around this thing.

682
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:03,606
I'm charging three murders.

683
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:06,769
You charge those cases,
my investigation folds.

684
00:54:07,045 --> 00:54:10,139
Not one of those cases is strong enough
for court. You know that.

685
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,375
So we bring the Barksdale kid in...

686
00:54:12,484 --> 00:54:15,419
throw a little mindfuck at him
and the case becomes stronger.

687
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,456
You've had him in the box twice before.
He's gonna go for less the third time.

688
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:22,459
So we re-canvass, develop fresh witnesses.

689
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:27,097
The case I charge on today
can be twice as strong by the trial date.

690
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,166
We get a conviction...

691
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:32,532
we roll Little Boy Barksdale
into Big Boy Barksdale...

692
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:34,631
then we go home...

693
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:38,174
Iike good old-fashioned cops
and pound some Budweiser.

694
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:42,913
This is bullshit!

695
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:47,210
It was McNulty who made
the ballistics match on these murders...

696
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:48,843
and he's telling me to fight this.

697
00:54:48,954 --> 00:54:50,979
He knows you don't have
a viable prosecution...

698
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:52,886
so do you, so do l.

699
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:54,219
Enough.

700
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:01,021
Look, I've got no love
for your wiretap, Lieutenant.

701
00:55:01,133 --> 00:55:02,930
I'm spending $2,000 a day...

702
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:04,870
over the unit operating budget
to staff the case.

703
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,235
over the unit operating budget
to staff the case.

704
00:55:07,105 --> 00:55:09,369
Now, Major Rawls here
is offering a chance...

705
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:12,568
to leverage Barksdale
through a murder prosecution.

706
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:14,440
Why not jump on this?

707
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:18,411
Because if Major Rawls is right...

708
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:22,076
then he will be just as right
a month from now.

709
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,856
If the wire doesn't give us a case,
he can charge all the murders he has.

710
00:55:25,957 --> 00:55:27,481
We lose nothing.

711
00:55:28,126 --> 00:55:29,753
But if he's wrong...

712
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:33,453
if he can't convict,
or if the Barksdale kid doesn't flip...

713
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:35,863
then it's too late to do anything else.

714
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:40,804
Avon Barksdale changes up his pattern,
and the wiretap dies.

715
00:55:40,906 --> 00:55:43,340
At that point,
there isn't going to be a thing...

716
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:47,673
that you, or me, or Rawls here
is gonna be able to say to that judge.

717
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:58,679
You wanted to see me, Major?

718
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:02,189
McNulty does personal business
on the clock, I want to know.

719
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:04,785
He cheats on a run sheet, I want to know.

720
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:07,262
He runs any kind of game at all,
I want to know.

721
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:09,663
Major, the man's an asshole...

722
00:56:10,502 --> 00:56:14,734
but he doesn't do much other than work.
He's got this case in his gut like it's cancer.

723
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,398
He does no wrong?

724
00:56:17,976 --> 00:56:19,204
Doesn't drink anymore?

725
00:56:19,311 --> 00:56:22,769
Doesn't drink on duty?
Doesn't drink and drive, Detective?

726
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:26,216
-Major....
-You've got to help me on this, Michael.

727
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:49,897
The murder warrant's on hold.

728
00:56:51,176 --> 00:56:53,337
The Deputy gave us another month.

729
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:57,213
Also, whoever that was
you brought in here today...

730
00:56:57,315 --> 00:57:00,284
gave himself up
as an eyewitness to the Gant murder.

731
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:01,815
Who? Omar?

732
00:57:02,287 --> 00:57:05,620
Greggs said to tell you
she'd write it up in the morning.

733
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:08,792
Lieutenant...

734
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:11,289
thanks.

735
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:19,468
It cost you?

736
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:30,468
