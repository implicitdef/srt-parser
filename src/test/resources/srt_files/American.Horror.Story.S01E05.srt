1
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:04,712
Ben...

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:06,343
Harmon!

3
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:08,581
I am not leaving here
till I have my $1,000!

4
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:09,582
Screw you!

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,618
You owe me!

6
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:13,053
Oh, here.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,959
Here, take one.

8
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:16,131
And go!

9
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,473
You little brats!

10
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,508
You little rotten-- go!

11
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:21,277
Come on, come on.

12
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:22,512
Hey, honey.

13
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,884
Dad, there's some freaky dude

14
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,318
at the door
screaming about money.

15
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:27,121
I think he might be
one of your patients.

16
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,623
I don't know,
should I call the cops?

17
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:29,626
No. No.

18
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:30,999
Just-Just keep the door closed.

19
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,002
Is it locked?

20
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,003
Yeah.

21
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,878
Okay, we're on our way home
right now.

22
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,515
Violet, just-just keep
the door locked.

23
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,450
Ah.

24
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:43,185
I know you're in there.

25
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:45,754
Is that your daughter?

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,074

27
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:39,630
Tate?

28
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:41,032
Hey.

29
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,002
It's been insane here.

30
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,537
First the cops were outside,
then some freak

31
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,639
started banging on the door,
screaming about money.

32
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:49,874
Hey, hey.

33
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,778
Shit like tend
to go down on Halloween.

34
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,080
It's probably just
asshole kids.

35
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,749
It's fine now.

36
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,784
I'm here.

37
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:02,591
I painted it black.

38
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,396
I know how you don't
like normal things.

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,632
You're the first boy
to ever give me a flower.

40
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,502
Thank you. I love it.

41
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,870
You ready to go on our date?

42
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:15,841
Yeah.

43
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,316
Violet?

44
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:24,918
Violet?!

45
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:26,921
Violet?

46
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:28,289
Violet!
Violet!

47
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,157
Violet?

48
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,458
Violet!

49
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,493
Viol...

50
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,461
Ben!

51
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,662
She's not here.

52
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,964
Call her cell phone.

53
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,211
Violet, where are you?

54
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,412
I'm just hanging with friends.

55
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,014
We told you not to leave.

56
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:53,082
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,417
I should've called you earlier.

58
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:56,152
Is this the part where
you make me come home?

59
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,722
Are you safe?
I swear.

60
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:01,859
Are you having fun?
Yeah.

61
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,061
What happened with the guy

62
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:04,929
who was banging on the door?

63
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:06,097
It was just some kids.

64
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:07,299
I think they were
playing a prank.

65
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:08,700
They went away.

66
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:09,835
I want you home in an hour.

67
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:12,304
Okay. All right, bye.

68
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,839
Who was that?
My mom.

69
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,840
Aw...

70
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,913
I spoke to Violet.

71
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,314
She was out with friends.

72
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,350
What are you doing
with a knife?

73
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,285
I'm sick of those kids
wrecking our house.

74
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:28,721
They destroyed the pumpkins
on the front porch.

75
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,157
So your plan is to kill them?

76
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,263
I'll go clean up
the mess out front.

77
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:37,531
Okay.

78
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,367
Clearly, we've both
had a long day.

79
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,740
I'm gonna go take a bath.

80
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,143
Then tomorrow,

81
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,812
I'd like to talk about
you moving out.

82
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,014
I'm not leaving this house.

83
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,952
And I'm not giving up
on this family.

84
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,958
You hear me?

85
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,893
I'm not

86
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,963
giving up on this family!

87

88
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,263
I want my money.

89
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,654
You stupid...

90
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,619
Son of a bitch.

91
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:33,780
Where is she?!
Who?!

92
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:35,053
Hayden! I know she's
out here somewhere.

93
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:36,622
Get your hands
off of me! Help!

94
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:38,324
Where is she?!
She's under the gazebo!

95
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:39,859
There's nothing under this
gazebo and you know it.

96
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:40,993
This was all
staged. Why?

97
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:42,361
What are you talking about?!

98
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:43,596
She was at my door
ten minutes ago!

99
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:44,797
What?

100
00:05:44,865 --> 00:05:46,332
Oh, shit!

101
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,534
Was she pissed?

102
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,603
I'm pissed!

103
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,738
All this for $1,000?

104
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,407
I don't think so.

105
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,076
What are you two playing at?

106
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:58,879
I won't be the victim
of your sick extortion.

107
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:00,013
You're in this together!

108
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:02,883
Oh, wow.

109
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:04,951
You really don't
get it, do you?

110
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,853
Your narrow, clinical
worldview doesn't let you.

111
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:09,288
Buddy, you are so screwed.

112
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,758
You know what the thing
about the dead is?

113
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:14,293
They got nothing left to lose!

114
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,527
Enough of this bullshit!

115
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:16,862
I want some goddamn answers!

116
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:20,800
Baby...

117
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:23,569
you don't even know
what the goddamn question is.

118
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:24,604
Where is she?!

119
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,374
Beats me.

120
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,676
Tell me!

121
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:33,347
She could be anywhere.

122
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,682
Probably here.

123
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:37,385
You better watch your back.

124
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:38,786
As well as your front.

125
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:41,757
Because, you thought
she was dangerous before...

126
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,292
Let me tell you who's dangerous.

127
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,793
That would be me!

128
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:46,729
You really want to keep going
with this story, Larry?!

129
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,531
'Cause I'm right at the edge!

130
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:50,700
And if I go over,
I'm taking you with me!

131
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:51,701
Do it.

132
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:52,902
Oh, do it now.

133
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,537
Oh, I'm begging you.

134
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:56,272
Please, kill me, Ben.

135
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,640
Kill me.

136
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,712
That way,

137
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,715
I can come back
and haunt you, too.

138
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:14,290
You see that crazy bitch,
you tell her we're done.

139
00:07:14,357 --> 00:07:15,991
I'm not playing your games.

140
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,595
You come back on this property,
and I will kill you.

141
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:20,663
You hear me?

142
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,631
I will kill you.

143
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,206
Promises, promises.

144
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:40,917
Hi.
Hi.

145
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:42,985
Um, sorry to bother you,
but your alarm was triggered.

146
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,620
Is everything okay here?
Yeah.

147
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:46,655
You know, our daughter
went out a little while ago.

148
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:47,889
I bet she set it off.

149
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,924
Oh, okay, okay.

150
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:52,226
Who, uh, who did this
to your pumpkin patch?

151
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:54,328
I don't know.

152
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:56,663
It looks like
asshole kids to me.

153
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:57,631
Yeah.

154
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:58,999
Yeah, well, you catch them doing

155
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,635
any more mischief,
send them my way.

156
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:03,370
Will do.

157
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:05,339
And thank you so much
for responding so quickly.

158
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,677
I must say, since we hired you,
I feel...

159
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:10,444
Safer?

160
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,546
Yeah, yeah.

161
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,481
Good.

162
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,749
Okay. Have a good night.

163
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:16,917
Thank you.

164
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,301
I want to.

165
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:38,705
Oh, no.

166
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:43,277
Sorry.

167
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:45,112
I thought...

168
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180
I just...

169
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:48,884
Violet, I swear...

170
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:51,120
I want to be with you so badly.

171
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:54,156
And that's never
happened to me.

172
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:56,359
With a girl.

173
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,928
Are you gay?

174
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,463
No.

175
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,365
I just...

176
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:14,143
Maybe it's those meds
your dad gave me.

177
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:15,612
...do that, you know.

178
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:22,686
I'm gonna go.

179
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,622
No, no. No, Vi.

180
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:27,759
I'm not ready to go.

181
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,495
Not yet.

182
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,811
I used to come here...

183
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,013
when the world closed in

184
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,816
and got so small
I couldn't breathe.

185
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:01,258
I'd look out at the ocean,
and I'd think...

186
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:04,662
"Yo, douche bag,

187
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,831
high school counts
for jack shit."

188
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:14,273
Kurt Cobain,

189
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,375
Quentin Tarantino,

190
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,543
Brando, De Niro,

191
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,446
Pacino...

192
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,648
all high school dropouts.

193
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,924
I...

194
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:38,493
hated high school.

195
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,002
So I'd come here

196
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,539
and I'd look out at this

197
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:53,643
vast, limitless expanse.

198
00:10:53,711 --> 00:11:00,116
Then it's like,
that's your life, man.

199
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:04,455
You can do anything,

200
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,924
be anything.

201
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:11,463
Screw high school. That's...

202
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,566
It's just a blip
in your timeline.

203
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,034
Don't get stuck there.

204
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,886
There's someone here.

205
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,894
Nice costumes.

206
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:45,097
What are you, the Dead
Breakfast Club?

207
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,265
You know, there's a whole lot
of beach, guys.

208
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,201
Good job, Tate.
You finally came out of hiding.

209
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,971
We've been waiting for years
for you to show your face.

210
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,475
- But you like Mommy's little safe house,
don't you? - I don't know you.

211
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,344
You know, I'm actually surprised you have
the balls to show your face around here.

212
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:01,547
Yeah. Maybe you should have worn a mask.
I'm not really into Halloween.

213
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:03,582
But this year's different,
right? You have a date.

214
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,045
How cute is that?

215
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:06,498
Leave her alone.

216
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,955
We don't want her.
We want you.

217
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,490
How about we drown him?

218
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,258
No, we should shoot him
right between the eyes.

219
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:17,295
Ha, ha, Halloween pranks.

220
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,131
Somebody please waste this bitch.
Yeah, why does he get a girlfriend?

221
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,834
I don't have a girlfriend.
Do you have a girlfriend?

222
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:25,571
Kyle, you?
No. I haven't had sex in a long time.

223
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:29,542
Come on, let's go.
This beach sucks.

224
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,445
Someone should
pick up the trash.

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,234
Hello.

226
00:12:58,302 --> 00:12:59,636
You called me?

227
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:02,472
Yeah, I did.

228
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:06,309
I think it's time for us
to have a conversation.

229
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:07,978
Has he told you about Boston?

230
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:10,380
Here's the thing, Hayden,

231
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:14,484
I know that you might find
this hard to believe,

232
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:18,488
but I was your age once too,
and not really that long ago.

233
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:21,192
And I wasn't such
a saint either.

234
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,026
I fell in love
with a married man,

235
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,062
and I lived and breathed
the fantasy

236
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,832
that we were going
to be together forever.

237
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,335
Soul mates and lovers, and
everyone was going to be happy,

238
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:34,038
and everybody lived forever.

239
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,708
And that didn't happen, Hayden.

240
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:40,212
'Cause it never happens
that way, it never does.

241
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,682
'Cause what he's looking for
has nothing to do with you.

242
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,117
It's got nothing
to do with anybody.

243
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:45,869
There's something
missing in him.

244
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,989
He found something in me he'll
never find in you again.

245
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:51,692
He said my face was soft
like a baby,

246
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,993
and between my thighs

247
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:55,562
I tasted like
raspberries and cream.

248
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,209
You know what I really regret

249
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,970
when I walked in on you
screwing my husband?

250
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,244
Was that I didn't just rip your
smug little face off!

251
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:07,311
Way too late for any
of that now, Mrs. Harmon.

252
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,108
Ask him about Boston.

253
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,536
Hayden is in the house!
Where?

254
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,264
I didn't see her, but I know she's here.
Where is she?

255
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,999
I'll look around. I can talk to her.
Do not talk to her.

256
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,068
I want to call the police
and have her arrested...

257
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,537
You're overreacting.
...and thrown in jail. I am not overreacting!

258
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,238
Hayden is just
a confused little girl.

259
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,541
She's not going to hurt you, Vivien...
Stop protecting her!

260
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:55,976
I'm not protecting her!
I'm protecting you!

261
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:59,212
You seriously want ten cop cars

262
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,648
out in front of Murder House
on Halloween night?!

263
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:04,217
You think that's going
to help us sell this place?

264
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,420
Just wait here.
Hayden!

265
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,507
Hayden?

266
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,346
You down here?

267
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,733
Hayden?

268
00:15:56,803 --> 00:15:58,003
Hayden?

269
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,174
I love it when you say my name.

270
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:05,377
Say it again.

271
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:12,684
Hayden, you have to leave.

272
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:16,721
Such a mean thing to do.

273
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,590
Close the door in my face?

274
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:23,961
How could you do that to the
mother of your child, Ben?

275
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:29,332
Come on, you
remember, don't you?

276
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,769
Hayden, I know what this is.

277
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,171
You can't extort me.

278
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,439
You and that psychopath.

279
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:39,108
Kiss me.

280
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,476
I miss your mouth.

281
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,212
I miss the way it tastes.

282
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,148
I'm aching for you.

283
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:48,652
My tongue is swollen,
my lips are raw.

284
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,967
I'm rotting from the inside out.

285
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:05,638
What's happening to me?

286
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:09,610
Oh, right, a gazebo, Ben?

287
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,680
Not even a decent
headstone? A gazebo?!

288
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,316
You thought I was gone, so you

289
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:17,952
just thought you could throw me
away like I didn't matter?!

290
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,453
Like I never even existed?!

291
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,289
Is that what you think
of women, Ben?

292
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,659
Like they're just some
disposable nothings

293
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,228
that you can sit on top of
as you casually drink ice tea?

294
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,930
Stop screwing with me!

295
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:32,500
What is this? What do you want?

296
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,804
I want your wife to know
the truth about you.

297
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:39,507
You're sick, Hayden.

298
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:42,977
You need help.
Professional help.

299
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:44,746
A therapist, Ben?

300
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,181
Is that what I need?

301
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:53,588
I really owe you an apology.

302
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,256
Here goes.

303
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,892
I'm so sorry about
what I did to you.

304
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,027
It was nothing personal...
I'll deal with you later.

305
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:02,296
Right now I need
to take care of Vivien.

306
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,831
Oh, please.

307
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,099
Let me help.

308
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,603
I haven't used this in ages.

309
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,780
What are you doing?

310
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:23,148
I'm redecorating.

311
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:25,217
I'm sorry, Vivien, I really am.

312
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,352
But you ruined my Halloween,

313
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,020
and now you have to pay.

314
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,521
Stop it!

315
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:35,025
All I wanted was one night
with my guy, some Halloween fun,

316
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:39,263
some crafting in a house that
I love and have bled for,

317
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,966
and you ruined it, and he left.
And now he's out at the bars.

318
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:45,736
He's probably on his fourth
unprotected blowjob.

319
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:49,808
You are a psychopath. I am
calling my security company.

320
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,510
You don't get it, do you?

321
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,047
No one can protect you now.

322
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:57,917
Get out of my house!

323
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:00,152
Get out of my house!

324
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,855
Get out of my house!
Get out!

325
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:05,557
Ben?!
Get out of my house!

326
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,892
It's mine!

327
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,128
Get out!

328
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,764
Ben!

329
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,266
Ben?

330
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:17,669
Ben?

331
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:29,013
Ben?

332
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,631
What is it, hon?
What is it, baby?

333
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:47,833
What is it, sweet girl?

334
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,059
Are you seriously going to act

335
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,695
like nothing happened
at the beach?

336
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:20,732
They totally knew you, Tate.
But I don't know them.

337
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,734
Then why do they hate you?

338
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:24,402
They-They're just
high school assholes.

339
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,506
I mean, the world's
full of them.

340
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:32,044
It's popular kids who get off
on being mean and cruel.

341
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:34,847
I thought you understood that.

342
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:38,218
Tate, I can tell you're totally freaked out.

343
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:47,392
It's them.

344
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,961
They followed us here?
This is bullshit.

345
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,533
Hayden?

346
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:57,934
Ben!

347
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:05,542
Hayden, where are you?

348
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,444
I wanted to apologize.

349
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:09,413
Oh, you wanted to apologize,
really?

350
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,348
I just thought
it would be a shame

351
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,017
to let all those lovely bubbles
go to waste.

352
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:17,554
I'm sure your maid
can deal with the ring.

353
00:21:17,622 --> 00:21:20,424
Where are you?

354
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,926
Come over here, girl.

355
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:26,128
I would be happy to.
Just tell me where you are.

356
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,863
I wasn't talking to you.

357
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,631
I love what you've done
with this kitchen.

358
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:31,366
Hallie, girl?

359
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:06,237
Hallie!

360
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,725
Oh, great, he sends
his little girlfriend out.

361
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:24,078
With a pair of scissors. You
gonna make us some paper dolls?

362
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:25,554
This is private property.

363
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:26,796
I have every right
to call the cops.

364
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,888
Go ahead, call them.
You'll probably need them.

365
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:30,089
Screw that.

366
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,424
She deserves whatever
happens to her.

367
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:34,160
Yeah, she's like those
lonely, fat chicks that

368
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,160
marry guys on Death Row.

369
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,944
You're deeply,
deeply disturbed.

370
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:40,332
You guys need
to take your disgusting

371
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,134
made-up faces and go home.
Made-up?

372
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,969
Now.

373
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:45,371
Home?
Where is that?

374
00:22:45,438 --> 00:22:47,239
I'm an only child.
After what happened,

375
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:49,475
my parents split up, sold
the house, moved away.

376
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:50,677
No forwarding address.

377
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,012
So I don't have a home.

378
00:22:57,518 --> 00:23:00,420
Parents suck,
but I can't fix it for you.

379
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:02,056
Can you fix this?
Can you give

380
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:04,526
me back my scholarship
to Georgia Tech?

381
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,561
I'm supposed to be starting
quarterback freshman year.

382
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:08,797
- She doesn't care.
- She's in love, and she'll do anything

383
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:11,600
for him, including giving him
her virginity.

384
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:12,802
Tonight was the night,
wasn't it?

385
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,837
None of your business.

386
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,672
KYLE Stupid slut.

387
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,273
She's worse than he is.

388
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:20,043
She thinks it's okay
what he did to us.

389
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,844
What did he do to you?!

390
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:22,678
She doesn't know.

391
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:23,980
About what?

392
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:32,155
It's okay.

393
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:36,091
How have you not heard about Westfield High?
We just moved here.

394
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,993
Pick up a yearbook, bitch.
Or read a newspaper.

395
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:41,730
We're kind of famous.
So you're popular

396
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,165
and you're pissed off.
I don't know who you are.

397
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,701
Let's put her down,
out of her misery.

398
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:48,469
Leave her alone!

399
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:50,504
Finally, the Prodigal Son
returns.

400
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:52,939
Come on down, man.
We've got some questions.

401
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,341
Go inside.
I can handle this.

402
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:55,342
I seriously doubt that.

403
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,176
Go inside!

404
00:23:56,243 --> 00:23:57,644
No. They want to hurt you.

405
00:23:57,712 --> 00:23:58,578
Karma's a bitch, Tate.

406
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,046
You want to talk to me?

407
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:01,214
Let's see how fast you can run.

408
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:21,804
Hello. Hey,
my boyfriend's in trouble.

409
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:23,372
There's a bunch of kids
chasing him.

410
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,741
I think they're gonna kill him.

411
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,410
Come with me to my house now.

412
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:30,079
Leave me alone, you crazy bitch!

413
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:32,548
Addy is dead because of you!

414
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:48,696
Hallie! Hallie.

415
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:50,231
Hallie, come here.
Hallie, come here!

416
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:55,068
What do you want, Hayden?!

417
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:57,604
For the truth to be known,
finally,

418
00:24:57,672 --> 00:24:58,972
and for once.

419
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,175
I'm not interested in anything
you have to say.

420
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:03,043
How well do you know
your husband?

421
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,812
Too well. Get out.

422
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,581
What do you think
he's capable of?

423
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:09,717
Adultery, clearly.

424
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:10,685
What about murder?

425
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,589
If you're trying to shock me,

426
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:17,592
or show me how enlightened
you are

427
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,364
about my perfect life,
you're a little late.

428
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,036
Leave.

429
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:27,971
Not until you know.

430
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,507
Not until you understand,

431
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:34,445
really understand who
it is you're married to.

432
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,282
That's all I want, Vivien...

433
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,385
for you to know the truth.

434
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:46,122
That's why we have
to talk about Boston,

435
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,557
about the pregnancy,

436
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,693
about everything.

437
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:52,928
He told you I'm pregnant?

438
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:54,663
What?

439
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,166
You're pregnant?

440
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:05,608
Oh, God, that's why.

441
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:08,210
That's why.

442
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:13,048
"It's your choice," he said.

443
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:15,351
"Yours."

444
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:20,824
But there was never any
other choice!

445
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,873
He didn't want me
to keep my baby,

446
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,142
because he already had yours.

447
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:54,959
What do you think you're doing
to my house?

448
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,010
You're a disgrace.

449
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:17,550
Is that all the fight you have
left in you?

450
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:22,587
How can you allow that ghoul
to take the only thing

451
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,556
that gives your pathetic life
any meaning at all?

452
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,960
Hold still.

453
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:34,765
I will not permit

454
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:37,401
another failure in this house.

455
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:42,573
Save the baby.

456
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:54,420
Hayden, I don't know what he did
to you or what you think...

457
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:56,923
That's the trouble!
You don't know!

458
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:58,357
I'm not some silly schoolgirl!

459
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:00,326
I'm a woman!

460
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:02,161
And I matter!

461
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:03,629
You're hurt.

462
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:06,332
Yes, I'm hurt!

463
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,900
He hurt me.

464
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:10,202
And he'll hurt you

465
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,205
and that baby.

466
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:16,875
That's why it's better
for you and for it

467
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:18,410
if we just end this now.

468
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:20,878
I'm going to cut it out
of you now.

469
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,713
No!
Hayden, no!

470
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:25,216
As him about Boston! Ask him!

471
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,783
Tell me about Boston, Ben!

472
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:28,352
Tell her!
Tell me about Boston, Ben!

473
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:30,354
Tell her!

474
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:32,722
I lied to you, Vivien.

475
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,958
I didn't go to Boston
to be with a patient.

476
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:37,761
I went there to be with Hayden.
She needed me.

477
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:41,564
She needed you because
she was pregnant, Ben?

478
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,233
But that's not true, is it?

479
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,902
Because you hadn't
seen her in over a year.

480
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:47,004
Isn't that right?

481
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,877
I went back.

482
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:56,048
Months later, I went back.

483
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:59,218
I lied about that, too.

484
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:01,842
There, she knows everything,
Hayden. Now put it down.

485
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:03,974
Please.

486
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,193
- Mrs. Harmon?
- Yeah!

487
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,748
You activated the panic button?

488
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,470
Yes.
She's the intruder?

489
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,412
Yes.

490
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:27,269
CONSTANCE
She wanted to be a pretty girl.

491
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:32,183
Of course, she didn't look
so pretty...

492
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,666
lying on that table

493
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:39,444
<i>under those harsh,</i>
<i>energy-efficient lights.</i>

494
00:29:41,003 --> 00:29:43,499
May I have a moment, please?

495
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:12,726
<i>One of the many comforts of</i>
<i>having children is knowing</i>

496
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:16,096
<i>one's youth has not fled,</i>
<i>but merely been passed down</i>

497
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:17,263
<i>to a new generation.</i>

498
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,679
<i>They say when a parent dies,</i>

499
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:39,018
<i>a child feels</i>
<i>his own mortality.</i>

500
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:43,322
<i>But when a child dies,</i>

501
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:48,259
<i>it's immortality</i>
<i>that a parent loses.</i>

502
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,243
Look at you, my pretty girl.

503
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:10,048
My beautiful, beautiful baby.

504
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:17,490
Constance, I'm so sorry.

505
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,062
Well, you did encourage her,
that's true.

506
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,498
But you were just trying
to be kind, weren't you?

507
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:34,038
I was the one who sent her out
into the world tonight.

508
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:36,940
And it did what it will do.

509
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,642
Go ahead, drink your,

510
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,877
drink your tea, honey.

511
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:43,981
Can I have one of those?

512
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:47,885
Oh, a cigarette?

513
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:48,986
Certainly.

514
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:54,793
Just don't let your mama know

515
00:31:54,861 --> 00:31:56,695
that I am encouraging
your vices.

516
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,973
You know, Adelaide was
a willful child.

517
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:12,013
I suppose if she inherited
anything from me, it was that.

518
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,248
In truth, I think

519
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:16,016
my little monster was more
like me

520
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:17,719
than any of my other children.

521
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:18,920
I didn't know
you had other children.

522
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:24,191
Tate is my son.

523
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,059
What?

524
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:30,496
He cannot know about this,
Violet.

525
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:33,465
He cannot know

526
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:36,836
that his sister has passed.

527
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:38,337
Not now.

528
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:40,240
He doesn't...

529
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:46,080
react well to certain things.

530
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:49,517
So you...
you have to promise me.

531
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,555
I don't understand.

532
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,624
Well, he's a sensitive boy.

533
00:32:55,692 --> 00:32:57,826
You've seen that.

534
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,529
He's a young man with...

535
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:02,597
too deep feelings,

536
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,766
the soul of a poet.

537
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:07,469
But none of the grit or steel

538
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:10,304
that acts as a bulwark
against this...

539
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:14,642
these horrors of this world.

540
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,077
The steel that...

541
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,279
has protected me.

542
00:33:18,347 --> 00:33:20,648
That Adelaide possessed.

543
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:23,218
And that...

544
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,420
that you have, too.

545
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:29,258
I, uh...

546
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:31,995
I think...

547
00:33:32,062 --> 00:33:36,800
that's why he's taken so
with you.

548
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:39,869
He craves your strength.

549
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,239
Look.

550
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:48,977
Maybe he misses his sister.

551
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:54,315
But we must
protect him, Violet.

552
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:07,962
I used to run track.

553
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,398
We know.
Is somebody going to explain this to me?

554
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,034
Do you believe in God?
Is that what this is about?

555
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:14,201
You guys are with
Campus Crusade.

556
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:17,772
You asked me
if I believed in God,

557
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,406
and you put a gun to my head.

558
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,774
I said yes.

559
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:23,744
It wasn't even true,
and I said yes.

560
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,313
And then...
you pulled the trigger.

561
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,383
What is this?

562
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,686
Is this part
of a Halloween act?

563
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:33,454
Because, I mean, the
makeup, it's chilling,

564
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,488
but the performance...

565
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,825
No more bullshit, Tate!

566
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,460
You owe us an explanation!

567
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:41,161
Why are you doing this to me?

568
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:42,863
What do you...

569
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:44,865
Why did you target the jocks?

570
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:47,267
I never did anything to you!

571
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,535
It wasn't
just the jocks, man.

572
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:50,938
I mean, look at me.
Look at Amir.

573
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,607
Did you ever once go
to a football game?

574
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,643
This guy was honor roll.

575
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:58,245
He could have been
valedictorian.

576
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,214
Asshole! No, I'm not going
to change

577
00:35:00,282 --> 00:35:02,917
the world, okay,
but he could have.

578
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:04,051
He could have been something,

579
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,653
and you ruined
all that potential.

580
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:07,522
We want to know why.

581
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:08,689
You owe us that.

582
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:09,857
Way more than that.

583
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,325
You got the wrong guy, okay?

584
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:12,493
No. Don't you re.

585
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,928
We have been looking
for you for years.

586
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:15,329
He's screwing with us.

587
00:35:15,397 --> 00:35:16,563
Maybe he's in denial.

588
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:17,732
Maybe he's psychotic.

589
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,967
Get out!

590
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,969
Get out of my head!

591
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,637
We aren't in your head.

592
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:25,273
We are right here.

593
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,208
Chloe, sun's coming up.
Please just say it.

594
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,211
Just say what you did.

595
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:38,853
I should be 34 years old.

596
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:41,790
And married, with babies.

597
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,792
I don't know you.

598
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:48,229
I'm sorry.

599
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:50,465
I don't know you.

600
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,200
Come on. We got to go.

601
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:30,370
How was your night?

602
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,607
My mother's dead.

603
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,910
I'm sorry.

604
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:38,613
I couldn't go with her.

605
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,114
No.

606
00:36:43,385 --> 00:36:46,119
I am not speaking to you.

607
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:48,188
I'm sorry, baby.

608
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,224
I can't help myself.

609
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:55,495
I feel like I'm doomed
for all of eternity

610
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:58,831
to be trapped in an unhappy,
adulterous relationship

611
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,110
wrecking on this goddamn house...

612
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,539
...which will never be
just the way I want it.

613
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:07,808
You are.

614
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,882
So what is it with you girls?

615
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,585
Young, everything to live for,

616
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,754
but you throw it all away

617
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,557
on some guy you
can't even have.

618
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,759
I did have him.

619
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:27,161
We were in love.

620
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:29,864
He was just too guilty
to leave her.

621
00:37:29,932 --> 00:37:32,466
A lovely woman
like Mrs. Harmon--

622
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,468
pretending
that you nuked her dog.

623
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:39,606
That's just evil--
just plain evil.

624
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,709
You don't do things like that
out of love.

625
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,111
What'd you put in there anyway?

626
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,946
Tomatoes.

627
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,715
It was a joke.

628
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,317
Stupid Halloween prank.

629
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:51,518
I see.

630
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,290
Oh, you don't see anything.

631
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,892
He was the love of my life.

632
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,094
What's going to happen now?

633
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:03,396
You're going to jail.

634
