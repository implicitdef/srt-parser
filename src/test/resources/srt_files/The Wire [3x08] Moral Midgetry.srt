1
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,741
Got that reddies, son.
Two for one, two for one.

2
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,779
I got that Rasheed and Beno.
Rasheed and Beno.

3
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,347
Put some ice on his nuts.

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,318
Tried and true,
that shit always bring a nigga back.

5
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,651
Where we gonna get ice from down here?

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:28,087
- Walk him up to Bon Secours.
- Rasheed and Beno. Rasheed and <i>Beno...</i>

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,366
- Can you give me an eight-ball?
- A eight-ball, huh?

8
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,567
So, how you doing today?

9
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,232
No offense,
but can you just get the eight-ball?

10
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,339
All right, all right. Just being social.

11
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,275
Got it right here, yo.

12
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,774
Thank you.

13
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:54,510
You hear Mack Man jewelers
got took off last night?

14
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,215
Got all this shit in the row house.
Down yonder.

15
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,554
Like a must-move situation.
Fifteen on the dollar.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,994
Y'all want some slamming ice,
go inside and tell my man Rafik sent you.

17
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,661
Lighters, pipes, matches. Pipes, lighters.

18
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,496
You need them, I got them.
Right here, pipes.

19
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,738
Reddies. Two for one, two for one.

20
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,538
Ask me if it's loaded, bitch.

21
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,650
Reddies, son, two for one.

22
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,356
- Anything up?
- Just a good package.

23
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,053
Three OD's.

24
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,719
Last one didn't look too good
before the ambo came, neither.

25
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:46,933
Oh, shit.

26
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,504
Hey, I'm a cop.

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,002
There's more inside, Carv.

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,936
Goddamn!

29
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,711
Can't you ever get a fucking police
around here when you need one?

30
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,942
Okay, on that burner?

31
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,352
I called Trac, gave them the serial number.

32
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,981
Trac Corporation told me
that they sent it to Northland...

33
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,457
a purchasing corporation.

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,223
Northland tells me they sent it
to their distribution center in Hagerstown.

35
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,863
Hagerstown tells me
they sent it to Buddy's Mondo Mart...

36
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:59,234
at 1440 Propane Road,
Falls Church, Virginia.

37
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,736
That's where it went out into the street.

38
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,830
What?

39
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:07,276
Did Buddy have them on display
to the left or the right of the cash register?

40
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,113
How would I know that?

41
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,147
All right.

42
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,247
As for the numbers
in the phone's speed dial...

43
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,825
we got one local number.

44
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,292
One number that tracks
to Bodie's grandmother's house...

45
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,692
on West Baltimore Street...

46
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,162
and six other numbers
that are all assigned...

47
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,427
to Trac disposable cell phones.

48
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,503
And those phones
were all purchased outside the city.

49
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,973
One each in Catonsville, Laurel, Bethesda...

50
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,906
and stores in Virginia...

51
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,572
at Springfield, Dumfries and Lakeside.

52
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:46,744
Everything's along l-95,
from here to almost Richmond.

53
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,750
They're driving 200 miles
every couple of weeks out of sheer caution.

54
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,348
It's beautiful.

55
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,295
What is?

56
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,162
The discipline of it.

57
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,735
In your life, did you think...

58
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,238
you would ever again see
Mount and Fayette like this?

59
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,373
Those ain't touts you're hearing, brother.

60
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,239
Those are birds chirping.

61
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,610
- How?
- I'll show you.

62
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,747
You said no whistles,
no muscle, no flexing.

63
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,284
You supposed to be all over that shit, man.

64
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,980
You even said it's supposed to be
like the Valley of Eden.

65
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,684
- To serve and protect, motherfuckers.
- Call it poetic injustice.

66
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,055
I want to file a report.

67
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,822
- Say what?
- You heard me.

68
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,898
You want to make a complaint to us
that you were selling drugs...

69
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,830
- and someone took your money?
- Fuck, yes.

70
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,140
- Here.
- Fredericksburg?

71
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,571
They're going all that way
to buy cell phones?

72
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,909
One here, two there.
No wholesale purchases.

73
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,677
They've been dumping phones
every two weeks or so...

74
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,049
and still they're worried
about catching a wiretap.

75
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:59,022
Just 'cause you're paranoid doesn't mean
someone's not out to get you, right?

76
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,786
Lt'd be nice to know who's buying
all those cell phones, though.

77
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,957
I'll drive.

78
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,456
Yo, yo, yo, yo. You up, old man?

79
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,956
They do have a point though, right?

80
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,292
I mean, we tell them to come down here
without the guns...

81
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,263
and then we fall down
on providing protection.

82
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,129
It's like the stickup crews
have these hoppers...

83
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,795
feeling like they live in a lamb pen.

84
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,965
They see one more gun,
Gandhi-world falls apart, this I guarantee.

85
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,967
So what are you doing about it?

86
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,409
I sent a few of the vics
over to the district with Herc.

87
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,505
Let them play with an Ident-A-Kit,
but you know how that goes.

88
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,677
Can I be honest?
It's not just the wolves circling the corral.

89
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,512
We got 50, 60 kids on the inside...

90
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,386
been fight or flight
since they popped out the chute...

91
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,459
and right now
they're just thumb-up-their-ass hanging.

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,085
All these ex-runners, ex-lookouts.

93
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,257
That shit worries me
as much as any carnivores out there.

94
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:19,061
If you want to neutralize a threat,
give it a job.

95
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,840
- As?
- Auxiliary cops.

96
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,502
Keep an eye out for the predators.

97
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,603
You got the dealers paying them
to do nothing no-how anyway.

98
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,706
- Kill two birds and all that.
- Right.

99
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,150
Throw them some bikes,
maybe police radios.

100
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,349
- We could do that.
- I was <i>being...</i> You're serious?

101
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,215
What in God's name did you do here?

102
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,692
WMD. Got that WMD.

103
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,633
Hey, how you doing?

104
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,466
We're looking for a guy who came in here,
ten or eleven days ago...

105
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,734
dropped cash
on a couple of disposable phones?

106
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,935
- Ten or eleven days ago?
- Yeah.

107
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,445
- Black, most likely.
- That really narrows it down.

108
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,443
How about we just check on
some of your security tapes?

109
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,040
From ten days ago?

110
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,815
Unless there's an incident,
we reuse those videotapes every week.

111
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,720
- Every week?
- It's Mondo Mart policy.

112
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,117
That went well.

113
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,522
- Yeah?
<i>- Briana Barksdale called for you.</i>

114
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,532
- Who?
<i>- D'Angelo Barksdale's mother.</i>

115
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,395
- You get her number?
<i>- You got a pen?</i>

116
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,731
<i>410-718-9433. Got it?</i>

117
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,901
All right.

118
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,478
<i>- You gonna call her?</i>
- I don't know.

119
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,877
<i>- It's all yours.</i>
- Thanks, Jay.

120
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,449
Hey, check it out.

121
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,316
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart,
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart. We're fucked.

122
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,288
Until we get here.
BaBa Jani Food Mart, Dumfries, Virginia.

123
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:50,192
We're gonna go 100 miles on the off-chance
this guy has a memory or a camera?

124
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,255
Do you really wanna go home early
and disappoint Lester Freamon?

125
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,800
Who was that who rang?

126
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,464
Guess who's calling Homicide
looking for me on D'Angelo Barksdale?

127
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,200
- His mama.
- Yeah?

128
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,640
Shit, I forgot I even tried
to press that thing.

129
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,712
Now she's calling up asking questions.

130
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,746
Waste of her time as it was mine.

131
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,010
Kind of like this road trip.

132
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,187
He do look natural.

133
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,665
That motherfucker Marlo.

134
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,531
We gonna have to get deep on this nigga.

135
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,472
I mean, it feels like ain't shit changed
except for a growing lightness in my wallet.

136
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,775
Where's my letter of approval, man,
from the Preservation motherfuckers?

137
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,873
- My right-of-way agreement, my sign-offs?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

138
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,952
Everything's right around the corner.

139
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,545
We got both the plumbing and
the electrical inspectors on for tomorrow...

140
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,521
Tuesday, the fire department's
coming out...

141
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,992
and that should do it, String,
you'll be on your way.

142
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,895
And by the way, congratulations.

143
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,094
You are now a minority contractor...

144
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,898
for the light bulb supply
to the Board of Education...

145
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,666
City of Baltimore.

146
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,869
What the fuck I know
about light bulbs, man?

147
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,435
Do you know how to put the words
on a B&B letterhead?

148
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,142
Come on, man, relax,
white guy's doing all the work.

149
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,649
You're just his beard
for the Empowerment grant.

150
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,684
That's an extra five Gs a month
for just laying in the cut.

151
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,456
See how it work?

152
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,155
I'm gonna bring you along, String,
but it ain't gonna be an overnight thing.

153
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,424
We spend this year dealing with the city...

154
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,297
the next doing business with the state.

155
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,903
However, year <i>three...</i>

156
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,974
Then we go for the gold.
Then we go federal.

157
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,478
Then we see the man
with his hand on the faucet.

158
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,382
- What faucet?
- The HUD faucet, the money faucet.

159
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,785
Look, man, I don't know why we got to wait
three years for that shit.

160
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,222
- I'm ready to run now.
- No. You're not.

161
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,660
I mean, forgive me...

162
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,323
but you still showing
a little bit of that street corner mentality.

163
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,662
Bugging about every dime you spend...

164
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:12,363
about the permits,
about setting up a PAC...

165
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,134
about dropping cash
into re-election war chests...

166
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,307
which, by the way, is how I get my gravy.

167
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,177
Look, it takes money
to make money, String...

168
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,749
otherwise, hell, every pauper'd be a king.

169
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,251
And I'm saying I'm ready to run now.

170
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,918
Three years.

171
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:35,153
Crawl, walk, and then run.

172
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,960
- No, man, nappy up there a little bit more.
- Yeah, yeah.

173
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,125
And the <i>eyes...</i> He had little beany eyes.

174
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,264
What the fuck is beany eyes?

175
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:50,608
- You know, little rat-eyes.
- Yeah, all right. Yo, put a mole on there.

176
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,407
- He didn't have a mole.
- He did, too.

177
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,606
You was just too busy shitting yourself
with that whistle to your dome...

178
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,617
- to see the motherfucker.
- Shit, fuck I did.

179
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,445
- How do you know how to do this?
- Man, how you don't know how to do this?

180
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,623
Make his ears stick up.

181
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,387
- Why?
- 'Cause I told you to.

182
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,996
Oh, shit, okay. Give him light eyes.

183
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,757
- Why?
- 'Cause I fucking told you to.

184
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,001
Okay, can you make them crossed?

185
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,835
This is fucking cool.

186
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,038
Check out these knuckleheads
on the Make-A-Face.

187
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,749
Bring that down.

188
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,175
Yeah, hang on.

189
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,918
- My brother, I'm telling you...
- Fuck this shit.

190
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,319
...that is not what this is all about.

191
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,257
Look, I'm just trying
to make my district livable.

192
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,363
I write off a few blocks in a few places,
but I save the rest.

193
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,955
No offense, but you're like the blind man
and the elephant.

194
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,058
It's a lot bigger
than what you got your hand on...

195
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,160
- you just can't see it.
- See what?

196
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,172
A great village of pain
and you're the mayor.

197
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,376
Where's your drinking water?

198
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,844
Where's your toilets,
your heat, your electricity?

199
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,945
Where's the needle truck...

200
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,315
the condom distribution,
the drug treatment intake?

201
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,416
Half these people are dying on their feet...

202
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,491
and the other half's gonna catch
what's killing them.

203
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,049
Look, they ain't no worse off
than when they was all over the map.

204
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,529
- Now they're just in one place, is all.
- And that place is hell.

205
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,604
Look, I'm a police.

206
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,440
So I can lock a man up
or I can move his ass off the corner.

207
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,650
Now, you want anything more than that,
you're in the wrong shop.

208
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,384
Hey, yo, make her hair
a little bit more straight.

209
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,091
Make it long. With bangs.

210
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,226
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

211
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,059
Now Chinese up them eyes, like Beyoncé.

212
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:57,699
- Get them cheekbones up a little bit.
- No, man, that's too much.

213
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,203
She's starting to look like a pie tin
with hair now, yo.

214
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,173
- Hang on.
- Yeah, all right.

215
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:07,405
- Pillow those lips a little bit.
- Oh, yeah, hook me up with that.

216
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,708
Yeah.

217
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,341
Yo, you got one of these does asses?

218
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,387
- What?
- Yeah, that's what's up. Hey.

219
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,427
Hey, guys.

220
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,766
How you doing?
We're looking for a cash purchase in here.

221
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,396
Maybe a couple of Trac phones.
Week or so back. Black guy most likely.

222
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,030
Oh, sure, that guy.
Every two weeks for him.

223
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,201
Last time, eight phones. Almost $900.

224
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,479
That's a lot of Ring Dings, no?

225
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,113
- Ring Dings?
- A joke.

226
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,618
You got some kind of transaction record?

227
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,130
Seek and you shall find.

228
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,727
Hang on.

229
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,626
Hang on.

230
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,106
$927.24.

231
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,467
- Can we have the tape for that day?
- No tape. I rewind every day.

232
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,008
- Keep this?
- Sure.

233
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,787
What the fuck do we do now?
Buy this guy a box of videotape?

234
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:28,148
Or camp out in this shithole for a week,
hoping our boy runs the same route?

235
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,794
I just know I got to put my mind
on something or I'm gonna slide back.

236
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,463
Need to be in control of myself,
you know what I'm saying?

237
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,870
- Take command of your life.
- Something.

238
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,034
- Cultivate some self-discipline.
- Or whatever.

239
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:50,078
What if I told you
that there's a certain liberation...

240
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,278
not in command or in self-control,
but in surrendering?

241
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,514
Well, that depends
on who you surrendering to.

242
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,759
Oh, that. Hey...

243
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,660
all due respect, you can stow that patter
right here and now.

244
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,997
Look, it ain't about me doing for me,
I don't think.

245
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,329
Might need to be about more than that.

246
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,833
So you're bringing in an overall decline
of 2 percent for the month...

247
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,741
but if I read this correctly,
almost half of that's coming...

248
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,871
from an eight-percent drop
in the Western District?

249
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,315
Major Colvin is himself willing
to acknowledge the possibility...

250
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,819
of a statistical variation from the mean
in his monthly stats.

251
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,287
Variation, huh?

252
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,686
Gentlemen, if I look through
the Western incident reports...

253
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,194
am I likely to find less crime,
or more incidents...

254
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,288
which have been downgraded
or unfounded?

255
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,960
Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me...

256
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,095
and if I'm wrong about that, if indeed
there is no manipulation involved...

257
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,367
I would like to know exactly what it is
that Major Colvin...

258
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,239
has learned about police work
that eludes the rest of your commanders.

259
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,006
Councilman, I assure you,
these stats are not massaged.

260
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,547
We don't do that.

261
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,617
I don't do that.
And I won't allow my people to do that.

262
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,585
Our feeling is that
it's genuinely an aberration.

263
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,282
And if it repeats itself next month...

264
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,551
then it bears
closer examination. Otherwise...

265
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,753
Moving on to new business, then.
How are we fixed for witness assistance?

266
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,094
Does the Department have sufficient funds
to ensure pre-trial security...

267
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,064
for any endangered witnesses?

268
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,863
We have the resources
that the city can afford, I'm sure.

269
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,238
I understand you're in no position
to criticize the Mayor.

270
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,039
- Nor would I.
- Nor would you.

271
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,538
So allow me to ask the question.
What is this city willing to pay...

272
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,551
to make it possible for ordinary people
to come down to the courthouse...

273
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,314
and perform the civic duty
of bearing witness...

274
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,413
against gangsters and criminals?

275
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,682
What resources are commensurate
with that kind of commitment?

276
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,794
You can play the good soldier
if you want, Commissioner...

277
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,093
but I want to go on the record here...

278
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,761
in saying that this administration
has passed the buck time and again...

279
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,531
and failed to protect those citizens...

280
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,197
who demonstrate
that kind of commitment...

281
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,242
and put their lives and livelihood at risk.

282
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,643
I would only like to add
that I feel as my colleague does...

283
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,545
that this administration
has failed this community.

284
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:08,180
Miserably. And we need
to do something about this.

285
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,525
Hey!

286
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,165
Y'all are friends. You're like brothers.

287
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,438
You lose that, you lose every damn thing.
Go on.

288
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,104
Kids messed up a good hoop.

289
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,014
Now they got one
looks like the original peach basket...

290
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,246
and they hanging onto it like a tit.

291
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,949
I don't know.

292
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,452
Maybe I should get up
some kind of tournament.

293
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,227
You play basketball?

294
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,092
Never was much for balls and sticks.
I was all about my hands.

295
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,689
- Boxer?
- Yeah.

296
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,896
Boxing?

297
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,295
I know a place where some of the kids go...

298
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:06,277
- but it ain't near close enough to here.
- I wouldn't mind taking a look at it.

299
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,278
Get a mental picture at least.

300
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,338
Hey, yo, what the hell's going on here?

301
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,949
Police pushed all the action down here
and a couple other places.

302
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,419
The deacon thinks that
maybe some people should come in here...

303
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,388
and take over the situation.

304
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,255
- Are you that people?
- One of them, maybe.

305
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,861
- Roman, man.
- Dennis.

306
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,338
You should lay back on this one.

307
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,538
Let me go talk to Buford Pusser
in there alone.

308
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,012
Excuse me?

309
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,152
And what it shows people
is that I know my business.

310
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,279
That I will hold people accountable
based on the facts.

311
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,254
- This is about what's right.
- There you go again.

312
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,383
What?

313
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,258
Do you think politics
is only about winning the argument?

314
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,491
That whoever has the right fact
at the right moment wins?

315
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,827
Clinton had facts. Kennedy had facts.
Yeah, but Reagan?

316
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,498
He couldn't have summoned a fact
if his life depended on it.

317
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,075
It's not just facts, it's how you use them.

318
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,973
And Tommy,
when you get hold of a fact or two...

319
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,137
you go smart-ass
and start beating on people.

320
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,544
- Yeah, that's...
- Clinton and Reagan...

321
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,138
when they got up to speak...

322
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,708
they gave everyone in the room
comfort and confidence.

323
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,285
You liked those guys.

324
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,788
You were happy to think
that they even liked you.

325
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,626
You're saying I'm not likable?

326
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,152
Jen?

327
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,761
When you're at home talking with me...

328
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,996
not the Council, not the cameras,
you're great.

329
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,041
When you tell me
what's really important to you, I believe.

330
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:48,441
You're smart, and you're ambitious,
and you've got a sharper tongue than most.

331
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,879
You can hold court
and you can tell a good story...

332
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,679
and you can win the argument if you want.

333
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,850
All of that shows, Tommy.

334
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,582
And at a Baltimore City Council meeting,
it shows well.

335
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,457
But if you want to be Mayor,
or Senator, or Governor one <i>day...</i>

336
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,297
Show them something more.

337
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,028
Baltimore, huh?

338
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,333
Went up there to the Harbor
with my wife for our anniversary.

339
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:19,240
- Charged us $12 for two beers.
- Shit, that's the least of it.

340
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,370
The whole damn town's
going to hell in a handbasket.

341
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,881
- And guess who's running the show?
- Who?

342
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,750
Who do you think?
The Department, City Hall, the courts.

343
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,050
Shit, the courts?
You know what they call it...

344
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,785
when judge, jury and perp
all go to the same family barbecue?

345
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,026
- Catch and release.
- No shit.

346
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,827
May God have mercy on any poor white boy
going to trial.

347
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,902
That's when everybody's got their ass
in the air talking about justice.

348
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,062
Can't wait to throw away the key.

349
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,370
I mean, they're not all so bad.

350
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,777
Actually, there's a lot of good ones.

351
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,816
I'm on the radio if you need me.

352
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,952
My wife, Carol-Ann.

353
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,361
- Some very good ones.
- Is there anything specific...

354
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,523
I can help you with
while you're down here, Detective?

355
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,965
Or is this just a courtesy call?

356
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,735
You know, you should meet my partner.
You'd like her.

357
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,400
Can't go through the front on this boy.

358
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,375
So I'm thinking we're gonna have to
creep around the back.

359
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,105
Get Devonne on it.

360
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,748
I got this for that other problem.

361
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,412
- Who this?
- Remember Fatface Rick, right?

362
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,424
Been going to them co-op meetings
with String. That's his cousin, Trina.

363
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,689
- Oh, you mean, Trina with the big old ass.
- Yeah, you on it.

364
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,127
That's her work number.
You know where she working at nowadays?

365
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,066
She over at the Department
of Social Services.

366
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,069
So you think Omar getting a check?

367
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,639
No, not now.
But, I mean, once upon a time...

368
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,073
before some fool gave little Omar Little
a shotgun.

369
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,668
I mean, cocksucker
was somebody's child, right?

370
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,509
So I'm thinking,
somewhere down in them records...

371
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,778
is one or two names of Omar's people.
You feel me?

372
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,679
You sure you want us
on Marlo and Omar both?

373
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,580
I mean, Omar ain't come back on us
since we got his bitch.

374
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,025
- So maybe...
- Look, I'm home, Charles. I'm home.

375
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,358
What's up?
Taking care of business, String?

376
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,104
Me too, man. Me, too.

377
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,589
- East Side wasn't ready for us, huh?
- That's what I'm saying.

378
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,299
Yeah, I know all about BaBa Jani
and his 24-hour turnover.

379
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,671
It's a real pain in my ass, too.

380
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,801
He's got a real problem
with the school kids there.

381
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,971
Every afternoon come 3:00,
they go in there...

382
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,345
crowd him at the counter,
boost all the car and gun magazines.

383
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,918
That surveillance tape's so grainy now...

384
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,647
it's like watching a herd of buffalo
in a snowstorm.

385
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,724
But my insurance man, Bob...

386
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,158
I got him to turn this camera here
right on BaBa's parking lot.

387
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,321
Now, anytime I have a real problem,
I just come to Bob and pull his tape.

388
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,996
I can get a copy of that for you
in the morning.

389
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,701
Your partner there.

390
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,506
Bit of an asshole.

391
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,379
- For real?
- Yeah.

392
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,181
Yeah, right hand up.

393
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,292
You know what this is? It's moral midgetry.

394
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,729
Turn the fucking world upside down...

395
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,628
and treat these brain-dead corner yo's
like princelings.

396
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,530
You see how clean the corners are?

397
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,160
In every sector,
street traffic is half what it was.

398
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,671
Fuck that. It's wrong, and it's wrong.

399
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,333
Like the other way was right
because we were doing so well.

400
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,000
And Colvin's answer is what?

401
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,477
Ride shotgun for hoppers?
Drown them in cash money pay?

402
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,548
Colvin? He's always been good police.

403
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,480
Then he's got to know
what a fucking heartbreaker it is...

404
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,518
to wake up every morning,
suit up for this shit.

405
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,678
He's got to suit up too, man.

406
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,684
Somebody should dime the brass
about this shit.

407
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,452
- Or the <i>Sun</i> papers.
- Let me ask you something.

408
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,661
Anybody here ever get jammed up
and not have Colvin go to the wall for you?

409
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,462
The man is trying something.
It may be hard to stomach, but it's working.

410
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,096
After 30 years, don't you think he's earned
the right to some elbow room on this?

411
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,106
What the fuck.
This thing is on borrowed time, anyhow.

412
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,268
And when we do decide
to jump on Hamsterdams...

413
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,869
they're just gonna go back
to their regular corners, right?

414
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,417
If we ever jump out on it.
I don't know that we're gonna.

415
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:30,511
All I'm saying is let's give the guy
the same backup he's always given us.

416
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,814
That's all I'm saying.

417
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,794
I swear, as soon as the sun comes up,
we grab that damn tape and go.

418
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,891
This place makes me want to cry.

419
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,367
Hey, I spent half my marriage
in rooms like this.

420
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,441
- How could you do it?
- What?

421
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,810
- Go nonstop hound on your ex like that.
- It's easy.

422
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,109
Just tell her I was on the road
working an extradition.

423
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,247
Lots of extraditions.

424
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:08,016
Brought back something like 500 fugitives
in a three-year period, I think.

425
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,152
- That's not what I meant.
- Right.

426
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,570
So, you're back in the house, huh?

427
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,207
Ate some shit and she took me back, yeah.

428
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,235
I ain't sure I even want to be back, though.

429
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,481
Extraditions, huh?

430
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,856
- Cheryl would see right through that shit.
- No, it's easy.

431
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,957
You just keep your cell off,
make sure she can reach your partner.

432
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,055
Partner tells her, "Kima's in court"
or whatever.

433
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,394
Partner calls you in the motel,
gives you the heads up...

434
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,164
you call her back later like,
"Hey, what's up?"

435
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,605
Ain't even got a quarter box
for the Magic Fingers.

436
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,308
Maybe you don't need
a quarter box for that.

437
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,779
- For what?
- Magic fingers.

438
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,998
You know me.

439
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,850
- You hustling?
- Educating.

440
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,625
Are you charging for it or tuition-free?

441
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,258
Tuition will come back to him tenfold
in acquired wisdom.

442
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,495
Besides, nothing in the world's
more expensive than "free."

443
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,094
That's all she wrote.

444
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,566
Let's double it.

445
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,576
No, man, I don't like taking money
from a churchgoing man.

446
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,839
- Triple it.
- Your break, Deacon.

447
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,414
We need to talk
some more about Hamsterdam.

448
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,421
Look, man, I never said it was pretty.

449
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,185
Pretty doesn't even come close
to the problem.

450
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,257
We need to talk.

451
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,223
I've got a COMSTAT meeting.

452
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,693
I'll drop by later on.

453
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,240
- So we good with the permits?
- Yeah, this week, so far, so good.

454
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,677
- All right.
- Look at you.

455
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,008
- Who?
- Chunky Coates.

456
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,182
- Who's that?
- You don't know Chunky?

457
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,687
He's got the properties down the block
and over on the even side of Paca Street.

458
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,884
When I first met that fat man,
he had an office so small...

459
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,824
you had to leave the room
to change your mind.

460
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:00,420
Then two years ago he started running
with your man, Clay Davis.

461
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,767
Look at you now, you big sassy bitch.

462
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,297
That better?

463
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,472
Hey, Special Agent Fitzhugh,
if that is in fact your real name.

464
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,903
FBI in on this?

465
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,546
I am only loved for my toys.
Lester called and I delivered.

466
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,984
You got the tape?

467
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:28,416
Date of 10l10l04. 15:04 hours, 30 seconds...

468
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,858
by the register tape.

469
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,633
Mama Barksdale?

470
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,335
D'Angelo's mother.

471
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,998
She cold-called McNulty
about her son on the jailhouse hanging.

472
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,775
She's calling us on that weak shit?

473
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,474
Is this Briana? Right.

474
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,781
You called about your son.
I'm returning that message.

475
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,313
Nothing there.

476
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,493
It's so tiny. No mere mortal <i>can...</i>

477
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,966
You see what he just did?

478
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,666
What? He did it again.

479
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,772
Who is this man?
Where does he come from?

480
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,439
Can anybody stop him?

481
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,409
Please don't hurt us, please.
My eyes! My eyes!

482
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,207
It's so big and clear and bright.

483
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,981
I'll be at Homicide.

484
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,484
Sometimes you still scare me,
you know that?

485
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:39,490
In my world,
do you have any idea what I had to do...

486
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,588
to get where I am today?

487
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,399
And when I say I'm ready,
you best believe it.

488
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:53,441
Through the effective use of resources,
and increased police presence...

489
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,707
and an intensive reach-out
into the community...

490
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,349
we've been able to have
a significant impact on these areas...

491
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,579
to the effect
of a 12-percent decrease overall.

492
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,254
- Twelve percent.
- Cumulatively.

493
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,990
- Over four weeks.
- Major, I know I gave you shit...

494
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,325
when your stats took a jump
a few weeks back...

495
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,657
but now you're gonna shove the numbers
right up my ass?

496
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,530
It's kind of pouty of you, isn't it?

497
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:23,437
Twelve percent. I didn't cook them then,
I ain't cooking them now.

498
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,476
Seriously, Bunny, I already got
the City Council asking questions...

499
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,943
about the eight-percent drop
you posted last week.

500
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:33,441
We just want to please the Mayor,
not go to jail behind this shit.

501
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,450
You know,
sometimes the gods do listen, sir.

502
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,546
Not in the Western, they don't.
Lieutenant Daniels?

503
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,726
- Sir?
- You want to take credit for any of this?

504
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,324
Your unit's been working in that district
a couple of weeks.

505
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,228
We're barely up on anything.

506
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,165
In fact, the crews we're looking at
are still beefing, still dropping bodies.

507
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,229
Amazing. Crime is down
and no one wants to take any credit.

508
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,639
What is wrong with this picture?

509
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,107
You don't mind
if I have Planning and Research...

510
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,941
pull all your CC numbers.

511
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,107
Make sure there's not a decimal point
missing between the one and the two?

512
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,243
Pull everything, Deputy.
That number will stand.

513
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,993
I called because I heard
you went and visited Donette.

514
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,303
Told her my son's death
couldn't have been no suicide.

515
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,739
- Is that right?
- I did do that.

516
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,704
D'Angelo hung himself.

517
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,146
Not with the belt
they found around his neck.

518
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,345
Not at that distance
between the doorknob and the floor.

519
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,520
So what are you saying?

520
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,589
- What am I saying?
- No.

521
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,521
Nobody would've dared.

522
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,001
- My brother, his uncle, would have...
- I agree with you.

523
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,694
Nobody would've dared.

524
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,398
<i>Unless...</i>

525
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,744
- Avon and D was family.
- Family, right.

526
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,183
This is just you talking, right?

527
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,085
- I mean, anyone else saying it?
- No, just me.

528
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,692
- No one else cares.
- Right.

529
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,423
It's just, I don't know, on the inside...

530
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,391
if somebody's going after you,
has got a beef, sees red, they use a shank.

531
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,004
It's quick and it's over.

532
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:39,002
D'Angelo was strangled, which is planned.

533
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,141
You need the time, you need the isolation.

534
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,109
Look, I'm just sorry I brought
this whole mess up to begin with...

535
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,153
'cause frankly, no one's gonna do shit
about it anyhow.

536
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,484
Whoever killed him
wanted to pass it off as a suicide...

537
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,492
and the cops are happy enough
to have one less murder to investigate.

538
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,324
On top of that, the Anne Arundel
State's Attorney doesn't give a fuck.

539
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,694
I'm not supposed to give a fuck, <i>so...</i>

540
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,803
I guess your son
just got squeezed between the sides.

541
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,964
Squeezed between what sides?

542
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,341
Look, two years ago...

543
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,311
we hung more wire
on your brother's crew than AT&T...

544
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,439
and at the end,
D'Angelo was this close to flipping...

545
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,007
giving up everybody, everything.
But you know all that, right?

546
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,054
You were the one
who went down to that detention center...

547
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,248
and talked your son out of a deal.

548
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,495
I kind of liked your son, you know?

549
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,826
All things considered,
he was a pretty decent kid.

550
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,165
And it grinds me
that no one ever spoke up for him.

551
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,731
Seems to me that nobody ever will.

552
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,705
But, mostly at this point,
I'm sorry I bothered his girl...

553
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,779
and I'm sorry she bothered you.

554
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,215
Why go to her?

555
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,648
- Why not come to me first?
- Honestly?

556
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,281
I was looking for somebody
who cared about the kid.

557
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:05,590
I mean, like I said, you were the one
who made him take the years, right?

558
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:24,613
<i>Red leader to red boys. Red two come in.</i>

559
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,675
<i>Cheese steak has a problem, bitch.</i>

560
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,750
Save me some fries, yo.

561
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,824
<i>You want fries?</i>
<i>I suggest you bring some cash up here.</i>

562
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,356
Can you believe this?

563
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,797
No muscle, it's all out in the open.

564
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:46,393
No, no, no, man. This right here, boy.

565
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,796
This too good.

566
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,743
Hey, yo, this some kind of
full-tilt setup, man...

567
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,813
to catch a master scoundrel.
Capone and whatnot.

568
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,311
Boy, they probably got police behind
every one of them row house windows.

569
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,512
Hit this? You must be tripping.

570
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,022
Home, James.

571
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,425
I'm gonna tell you, boy, you better keep
your head back in the game...

572
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,224
or you gonna land us both in the pokey.

573
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,429
- What you looking at?
- You.

574
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:54,962
Yeah?

575
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,339
I like your eyes. They're like cat eyes.

576
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,412
- Who you here with?
- Them.

577
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,278
That's it?

578
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,675
What kind of cat?

579
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,117
- What?
- What kind of cat are my eyes like?

580
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,091
A big cat.

581
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,030
- You here with them and no one else?
- I said that.

582
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,998
- You want to dance?
- Hell, no.

583
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,661
- You want a drink?
- No, I don't do that neither.

584
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,366
What do you do?

585
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,525
Gene, this spot I'm telling you about?

586
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,964
We're talking TB, HIV, syphilis...

587
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,297
herpes, lice.

588
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,400
It's like a five-acre petri dish.

589
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,029
You get in there now...

590
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,439
you can run every health program
or social program you want.

591
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:10,742
Hell, every kind of liberal-ass project
never got off the page it was written on.

592
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,145
<i>Jurassic Park.</i>

593
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,740
So, you're saying that this is
a sanctioned open-air drug market.

594
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,811
No, it's not officially sanctioned.
It's more like it's tolerated.

595
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,650
That's why we came to you
and the Public Health School...

596
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,192
not the City Health Department.

597
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:28,231
Needle exchange, drug outreach,
condoms, HIV testing.

598
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,967
Y'all ain't never gonna reach more people
in the same spot.

599
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,263
So if the city doesn't know about it
then that makes <i>it...</i>

600
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,669
- Complicated.
- That means temporary.

601
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,741
You move it or you lose it, boss.

602
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,790
That was nice.

603
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,832
It worked for me.

604
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:13,409
- You free tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

605
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,676
You could come back to my crib.
Nobody's there but my grandma.

606
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,884
Get us a real bed. Take some time with it.

607
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,885
Give me your number.

608
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,021
The reason I'm saying tomorrow,
not to push...

609
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,997
but day after that
I got to go visit my aunt in Florida.

610
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,858
We hook up tomorrow...

611
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:43,099
I got something real nice to think about
on that long-ass bus ride.

612
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,908
After you.

613
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,515
- What was it again?
- Devonne.

614
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,207
This guy's running his route
every five days.

615
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,008
- That's a shitload of burners.
- I don't get it.

616
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,115
They were so careful
spreading out the purchases...

617
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,980
up and down the three states...

618
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,145
you'd think they'd also
switch up rental agencies.

619
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,450
Maybe the guy felt bad for us.

620
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,716
You got a copier, right?

621
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,868
Damn, girl, what, you lose some weight?

622
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,469
- Excuse me?
- It's just a compliment.

623
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,141
Yo, that's Mrs. Omar?

624
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,408
Yeah, his grandmoms.

625
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,847
So what, we jack her and make her talk?

626
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:37,317
Fool, she probably got no clue
where he lay his head.

627
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,385
No, man, we sit and we wait, right?

628
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,620
Man, wait on what?

629
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,662
Stupid motherfucker.

630
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,603
Now, see, if we go upstairs,
we'll spook him.

631
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,934
So he's coming down. All right?

632
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,250
Russell Bell.

633
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,751
I know B&B
like I know a thousand other outfits...

634
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,865
but I don't know him.
Why should I talk to him?

635
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:26,198
Because Russell's a good man.
And he's ready to run.

636
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,939
- Then let him run for you.
- Hang on.

637
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,867
Wait a minute, partner.

638
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,308
I don't think you know
who you're dealing with here.

639
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,901
You know who that is?

640
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,485
Got your running shoes on? You're in.

641
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,123
That's the faucet?

642
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,223
Shit, as far as the federal money's
concerned, he's everything.

643
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,562
The faucet, the goose.

644
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,900
- What goose?
- The one that lays them golden eggs.

645
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,723
Madison Square Garden it ain't.

646
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,120
But it could work.

647
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,428
You're gonna need a little help
with the cleanup.

648
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,524
I'll piece that together.

649
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,633
This my trip, man.

650
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,640
Need to go from A to B all by myself.

651
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,781
<i>... am I likely to find less crime,</i>
<i>or more incidents...</i>

652
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,976
<i>that have been downgraded</i>
<i>or unfounded?</i>

653
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,610
<i>Because this kind of variation screams</i>
<i>manipulation to me...</i>

654
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,348
Slow your words.

655
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,153
Try to lock your eyes
on whoever you talk to.

656
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,285
Make them think they matter.

657
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:02,758
Use open, warm phrases.
Nothing sharp, nothing that bites.

658
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,994
- Where's the fun in that?
- Do you want this?

659
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,611
<i>What is this city willing to pay</i>
<i>to make it possible for ordinary people...</i>

660
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,737
- It's me.
<i>- Hey. How you, Cat Eyes?</i>

661
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,712
- Yeah, when you say you leaving again?
<i>- Tomorrow.</i>

662
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:22,308
<i>- Wanna get together tonight?</i>
- Yeah, we could hook up tonight.

663
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,980
<i>- How about coming over to my crib?</i>
- No, not your crib.

664
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,558
<i>- Where then?</i>
- Go to a motel.

665
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,586
<i>You want me to meet you? Which one?</i>

666
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:35,028
I don't know which one.
I'll tell you when I see you.

667
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:39,497
<i>- I'd like to see you soon.</i>
- All right, you know Lake Trout?

668
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,572
<i>- Carry-out? Where?</i>
- On Woodland.

669
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,971
<i>- Off Reisterstown Road?</i>
- That one.

670
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,009
<i>Later this afternoon?</i>

671
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:51,207
<i>- I'll be there. What time you want to meet?</i>
- Like 5:00.

672
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:56,677
And 5:00 mean 5:00. I don't truck CP Time.
5:00 and change, I'm gone.

673
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,252
<i>- I ain't gonna be late.</i>
- All right, then.

674
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,889
<i>See you then.</i>

675
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,487
What you think about that?

676
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,435
I don't know.

677
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,372
Might be walking into something
a little later.

678
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:21,103
So I'm gonna need for you to go up there
and get me a read up front.

679
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,817
- Where's my brother?
- Shut the door, man.

680
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:38,485
- Yo, we at war right now, sis. So he on that.
- I need to get with him.

681
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,128
Well, he ain't on the cell phone.

682
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,165
Soon as I speak to him,
I'll get him to you, all right?

683
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,258
I can't believe this shit.

684
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,230
<i>Look...</i>

685
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,203
Heard from this cop.
He's saying D was murdered.

686
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,642
Oh, that'd be McNulty.

687
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,237
How you know?

688
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,977
Well, Levy figured
he couldn't talk you out of the meet...

689
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,779
but I sure wish he tried.

690
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,713
- I need to get with my brother.
- Oh, come on.

691
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,186
This fucking cop.

692
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,028
He trying to drive a wedge up in here,
man. You can't see it?

693
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,795
Look, I can imagine
how hard it is for a mother...

694
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,964
to have to deal with some shit like that.
No doubt.

695
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:27,373
But the fact is these places,
they press on niggas.

696
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,438
D just figured a way
to get out of there early.

697
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,346
Ain't nothing nobody can do about that.

698
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,049
I mean, how do you protect
a man from himself?

699
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,624
Where Avon at? I'll go to him.

700
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,817
I told you.
We beefing for corners right now.

701
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:47,522
As soon as I speak to him,
I'll get him to you, I promise.

702
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,299
A cop shouldn't mess
with a mother's pain like that.

703
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:54,870
No one should.

704
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,919
Yeah, let me get four trout on white,
extra mayo on one...

705
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,581
hot sauce on two
and the other with ketchup.

706
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,351
And four orange sodas.

707
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,629
This clown-ass nigga went and got
four sandwiches and four sodas, man.

708
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,635
- You heard me?
- Cool.

709
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,542
Niggas don't roll out in a few minutes,
we onto something.

710
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,351
Drop one, get one!

711
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,685
- No, baby, this one's sentimental.
- Here, it's bleach.

712
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,123
Soak your works and you're good to go.

713
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,489
Drop one, get one.

714
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,193
Drop one, get one.

715
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,799
Get the other girls to come by.

716
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,737
Wait.

717
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,111
Just pass these out for me, okay?

718
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,273
Yo, I just rolled for peanut butter.
You got anything else?

719
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,579
- The fuck I look like to you, Chef Boyardee?
- Who?

720
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:53,349
Hey, when all this bullshit falls apart,
I'm gonna kick your <i>fuck...</i>

721
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,745
Go by them slow.

722
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,371
Oh, shit!

723
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:49,877
Oh, my God!

724
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,915
- You hit?
- No.

725
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,984
Drive, motherfucker, get out of here!

726
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:17,471
Now your man better be as good
as his word. Or your word.

727
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,737
If you are still in possession
of that kind of mentality...

728
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,941
then you are definitely not ready.

729
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:28,677
- String...
- Not now.

730
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:30,810
- It's Avon.
- Shut the door.

731
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,823
Let's do it.

732
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,393
I'll be in touch, partner.

733
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,560
- What is it, man?
- Avon's been hit.

734
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,899
- Where?
- In the shoulder.

735
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,736
Tater got killed. Avon still breathing, man.

736
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,704
But Briana all over me, calling me, man.
I need to tell her.

737
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,302
- No, fuck Briana.
- What?

738
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,406
Just keep the bitch away from me,
you hear me?

739
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:14,825
If you put them pit bull-style stitches in me,
the next patient's gonna be you.

740
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,196
- For real.
- What, you don't like rawhide?

741
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,462
Marlo!

742
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,332
We finna get back to old times, baby.

743
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,347
Hey, Anthony. Where you at?

744
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,822
First floor, 1034 North Mount, sir.

745
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,094
Good.

746
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,231
They're expecting us to hit back wild.

747
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,867
That's what they're just waiting for,
and we're gonna sit back on it for a while.

748
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,241
- Let them sweat on it.
- Yo, we got to talk.

749
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,540
Hold on.

750
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,211
I mean, he got to come out on his corners,
that's how he make money, right?

751
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,785
We gonna see
who got the bigger war chest.

752
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:10,944
Avon?

753
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,323
- Straight to the mattresses, huh?
- Whatever. What you want, man?

754
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:28,234
- "War", man, we past this bullshit.
- Yeah, I forgot.

755
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,637
You know, I knew I forgot something.
We the Trump brothers.

756
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,504
Man, you don't give this shit up...

757
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,044
you're gonna turn everything
we built to shit.

758
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:39,877
No. The Chump brothers.

759
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,419
You know what the difference is
between me and you?

760
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,321
I bleed red, you bleed green.
What you been building for us?

761
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,357
You know what, I look at you these days,
you know what I see?

762
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,691
I see a man without a country.

763
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:58,263
Not hard enough for this, right here.
And maybe, just maybe...

764
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,394
- not smart enough for them out there.
- Not hard enough?

765
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,572
No offense,
but I don't think you ever really were.

766
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,873
- You got skills, yeah, no doubt, but...
- What?

767
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,947
What, 'cause I don't shoot up a block,
indiscriminate, I ain't hard enough?

768
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:18,245
Because I think before I snatch a life,
I ain't into this bullshit?

769
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,378
Snatch a life?

770
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,549
What life you snatch, huh?

771
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:34,028
You know, Briana went downtown, man,
saw that detective.

772
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:38,734
Man stoking her head saying
that D'Angelo's death was no suicide.

773
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,637
Yeah, so?

774
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,372
Man ain't wrong about that.

775
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,378
What?

776
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,284
Yeah.

777
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,685
I knew you couldn't do it...

778
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,762
and Briana wouldn't do that shit.

779
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,731
But there go a life
that had to be snatched, Avon.

780
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,116
Yo, man, I took that shit off you,
and put it on me, man...

781
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,652
because that motherfucker
was out of pocket with that shit!

782
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,847
Twenty years above his fucking head.

783
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,690
He flip, man, they got you and me
and fucking Briana!

784
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,318
No fucking way, man. Hell no!

785
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,492
Now, I know you're family.
You loved that nigga.

786
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,089
But you want to talk that
"blood is thicker than water" bullshit...

787
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,896
take that shit somewhere else, nigga!

788
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,471
That motherfucker would have taken down
the whole fucking show...

789
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,267
starting with you, killer!

790
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,210
He was fucking everything and everybody!

791
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,749
Let me up.

792
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,391
Let me up.

793
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,630
Oh, shit.
