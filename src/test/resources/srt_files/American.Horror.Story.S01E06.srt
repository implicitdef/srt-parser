1
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:04,365
(doorbell ringing, knocking on door)

2
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:09,769
Does Tate Langdon live here?

3
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:11,051
He's my son.

4
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:13,020
Why? What has he done?

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:14,087
All right, make entry.

6
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:15,155
(sirens wailing in distance)

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,025
Stop it.

9
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:30,204
Ah, okay.

10
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:38,145
(two gunshots)

11
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,782
(people screaming in distance)

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,217
(three gunshots)

13
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,424
(footsteps running)

14
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:53,824
What the hell, dude?

15
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:55,685
Somebody's shooting up the school.

16
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,106
He's shooting people.

17
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:58,295
Wait, are you hit?
Where are you hit?

18
00:00:58,415 --> 00:01:00,309
Shit, I don't, I don't know, man.

19
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:01,343
That's not my blood.

20
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,578
I was right next to Mark Finstein,

21
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,680
and the guy shot him
in the freaking skull.

22
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:05,514
Who's doing this?

23
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:06,648
I-I don't know.

24
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:07,649
We need to get the hell out of here!

25
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:09,350
(two gunshots)

26
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:12,153
Go! Go!

27
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:20,728
(footsteps walking slowly)

28
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:25,032
(door handle rattling)

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,934
(muffled whimpering)

30
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,574
(sniffles)

31
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,476
(footsteps slowly walking away)

32
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:47,655
(whispers):
Block the door!

33
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:48,857
Get the door!

34
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,605
(rapid gunshots)

35
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:40,039
(boy whistling tune)

36
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:43,275
(panting)

37
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:45,644
(screams)

38
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:54,187
(gunshot, body thuds)

39
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:57,890
(footsteps walking)

40
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:00,694
(whispers):
Hey.

41
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:11,805
No, no.

42
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:12,740
Please, no!

43
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:13,507
(gunshot)

44
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:15,543
(whimpers softly)

45
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,944
(footsteps walking)

46
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,826
(gunshot, thud)

47
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:38,498
Screw this.

48
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:41,701
It's going to be okay.

49
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,370
Ev-Everything is
going to be okay.

50
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:47,074
It's going to be okay.

51
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:50,810
(shell clatters on floor)

52
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,279
Hey!

53
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,217
It's enough.
Get out of here.

54
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:56,884
(gunshot)

55
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:58,219
(sobs)

56
00:03:58,287 --> 00:03:59,120
(pumps shotgun)

57
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:00,689
Oh, God!

58
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:03,458
(sirens approaching)

59
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,159
(sobbing)

60
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,460
Oh, God.

61
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,095
(sobbing)

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,433
Please!

63
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:16,402
(screams)

64
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:20,105
Why?!

65
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,374
(sobs):
Why?

66
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:25,176
(pumps shotgun)

67
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:27,178
(sirens getting closer)

68
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:28,313
Please.

69
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,315
(gunshot)

70
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:32,117
(sirens wailing)

71
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:33,285
CONSTANCE:
Let me just talk to him!

72
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,787
Please, just let me talk to him!

73
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,288
Tate!

74
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:37,789
(sobbing):
Tate. No, please.

75
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,125
He'll go peacefully.

76
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:43,028
He's just a child!
He's just a child!

77
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,897
Tate! Tate!

78
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:47,366
Oh, God, please don't do this!

79
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,800
He's just a child!

80
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:50,101
Let me talk to him!

81
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:51,102
(whispers gunshot sound)

82

83
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,742
(panting)

84
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,336
Mom?

85
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:40,398
Mom?

86
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,138
Mommy.

87
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:47,379
She's not here.

88
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:48,375
Where is she?

89
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,745
Did you hurt her?

90
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:50,996
(chuckles)

91
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:52,417
Of course not.

92
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,119
She's probably at the grocery store,

93
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:56,588
buying some frozen fare to
reheat for your supper tonight.

94
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,859
You found out about Tate,

95
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,394
didn't you?

96
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:02,696
I knew you would.

97
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,698
Get out of my house!

98
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:05,999
This is not happening.

99
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:09,337
I questioned my sanity
when I first found out..

100
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:12,273
But this house...

101
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:14,175
this house will make you a believer.

102
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:16,711
You see, Violet,

103
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,349
we were living here
when Tate lost his way.

104
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:25,886
And I believe that the house
drove him to it.

105
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,987
What? No.

106
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,088
That can't be real.

107
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:31,224
You're a smart girl.
How can you be

108
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,493
so arrogant to think
that there's only one reality

109
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,828
that you're able to see?

110
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:37,763
I want you to meet someone.

111
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:44,302
Violet Harmon,
meet Billie Dean Howard.

112
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,141
The child has no manners.

113
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,075
Billie is a gifted medium.
She can help.

114
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,810
You're confused.

115
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:54,078
Overwhelmed.

116
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,380
Why wouldn't you be?

117
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:56,514
I never asked for any of this.

118
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,783
None of us did.

119
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,085
But nothing can be done
once one's been chosen.

120
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,790
Billie has been helping me for years.

121
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:09,027
I first found her on Craigslist.

122
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,961
I've been through all the phonies,

123
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,698
but she is 100% authentic.

124
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:17,034
I've just come from a
meeting at Lifetime;

125
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:19,002
they're interested in
making a pilot with me.

126
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,171
A Craigslist psychic
with a Hollywood agent.

127
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:22,973
Who'd have thought?

128
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,308
A medium, dear.

129
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:27,110
I can't read your future.

130
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,178
That's a different gift.

131
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,412
Have some chamomile tea.

132
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:31,848
It'll calm the nerves.

133
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,249
I'm in a dream.

134
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:34,350
I used to be like you.

135
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:35,985
Until I was 25.

136
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:39,521
When out of the blue, my cleaning lady

137
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,122
shows up as I'm brushing my teeth.

138
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,126
Except she's got no toilet brush

139
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:47,295
and rubber gloves,
she's naked and bloody.

140
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:51,466
Her husband murdered
her with an ice pick.

141
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:52,901
It's hard to keep good help.

142
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:54,169
BILLIE:
Do you think I wanted

143
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:55,671
a bloody Mexican ghost in my bathroom?

144
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:58,040
All I wanted

145
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,842
was to improve my tennis game

146
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,347
and unseat Charlotte Whitney
as president of my book club.

147
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:04,448
But I was chosen.

148
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:07,384
And when you're chosen,

149
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:09,920
you either get with the program
or you go crazy.

150
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:13,891
Understanding the truth
is your only choice.

151
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,192
What's your version of the truth?

152
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,463
There are some who have

153
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:22,865
an understandably violent
and vengeful reaction

154
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,934
to being horribly murdered.

155
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:28,570
They refuse to move on, until
they exact their pound of flesh.

156
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:30,773
Then there are a very few souls,

157
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,642
like Tate,

158
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,345
who don't even know they're dead,

159
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:37,148
who walk among the living

160
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:39,150
in child-like
confusion.

161
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,686
That's why I wanted him
to see your father.

162
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:44,656
I was hoping your father
might help him achieve some

163
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:46,492
clarity about himself

164
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,694
so that he could
see the truth on his own.

165
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:53,498
We must help him cross over, Violet.

166
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:57,268
This is bullshit.

167
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:59,037
I was set up.

168
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:01,306
My computer was--
someone messed with my...

169
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:03,241
Who is Mary?

170
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,844
VIVIEN: <i>Violet, she wants</i>

172
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:15,218
I don't understand you.

173
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:20,257
Never will understand you.

174
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,161
Does that mean anything to you?

175
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,530
"They don't
understand you?"

176
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:26,798

178
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,238
Can I trust her?

179
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:35,307
I'm not sure.

180
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:40,813

184
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:30,794
Okay, so I've checked the perimeter

185
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,262
of the property, the
upstairs, the basement.

186
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,031
Everything's secure.

187
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:35,967
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just hearing things.

188
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,435
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

189
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:39,104
Oh, no, it's not a waste
of time. Not at all.

190
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:40,739
That's what I'm here for.

191
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:42,474
Even if it's only for
your peace of mind.

192
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,945
Thank you. My husband just moved
out recently, so...

193
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,047
He had an affair,

194
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,350
and don't know why I'm telling
you this.

195
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,718
Oh, no. It's okay.

196
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:54,254
Actually, we get sensitivity training.

197
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:58,493
We deal with people's worst
fears, real or imaginary.

198
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,360
That makes sense.

199
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:00,728
But, actually, with the, uh,

200
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:04,565
with the infidelity,

201
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,901
I have firsthand experience with that.

202
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,436
Hmm.
Not me. No, my wife.

203
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:09,570
With another man?

204
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,239
It was a woman.
Yeah, I know. A lot

205
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:14,876
of guys would be into that,
right? Me, not so much.

208
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,147
I thought I heard somebody.

209
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,449
Where? Outside or inside?

210
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:21,349
Outside.

211
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,450
I looked around,

212
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:23,852
checked the alarm system.

213
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,255
Everything seems to be working fine.

214
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:27,690
Thanks for filling in.

215
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:30,426
Oh, by the way, the woman
that I took out of here?

216
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,562
She never made it to
the police station.

217
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,897
What? I don't understand.

218
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:35,532
She must have hopped out of my vehicle

219
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,367
at a stop sign or something.

220
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,035
Please keep you alarm on
even when you're home.

221
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:39,736
Thank you.

What are you doing here?
I've got to work, Vivien.

224
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:49,812
Rent an office.

225
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,347
We don't the have the money, Viv!

226
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:56,119
I promise I'll leave right after
my last patient.

227
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:57,521
I don't want you here.

228
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:59,423
You brought this on yourself.

229
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:01,591
(sighs)
You're right.

230
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,994
And you're angry.

231
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:06,063
If you violated our marriage

232
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,597
right in front of me, I'd be furious.

233
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,367
But I need a place to work, Vivien.

234
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:14,004
We need the money.

235
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:17,808
I'm finding it really hard
to look at your face.

want to bash it in.

I find you disgusting...

238
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:30,720
and disappointing

239
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,522
as a man.

240
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,324
And we're gonna end this marriage

241
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,159
and we're gonna sell this house

242
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,161
and I'll let you be a father
to our kids

243
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:40,163
because I happen
to think that you're a good one.

244
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:41,498
But I'm not gonna be your friend.

245
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,600
I will merely tolerate you.

246
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:46,169
And you can see
your patients in the house,

247
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,906

your last session of the day.

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,585
Oh, God.
It's, uh, it's terrifying.

281
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:44,058
Okay, story goes, um... he was
a hog butcher in Chicago

282
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,794
during the World's Fair of 1893.

283
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,697
And before he would go
into the slaughter pen,

284
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:54,667
he would put on this mask,
this pig mask

285
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:58,270
that he'd made from one of his
other kills,

286
00:15:58,338 --> 00:15:59,471
and he would snort--
(snorts)

287
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,139
you know, like a pig--

288
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:03,008
make 'em think he was one of them.

289
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:04,776
Then one day, he slipped

290
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:09,280
and he fell.
The pigs, hogs tore him apart.

291
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:12,384
And they didn't find
one piece of him anywhere.

292
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:15,387
So everyone assumed.

293
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:19,090
'Cause not too long after,
his former customers,

294
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:21,626
they started turning up dead;

295
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:25,030
gutted, skinned and hung upside down

296
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:27,566
in the bathtub to drain,
like a hog in his shop.

297
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:32,871
And they say if you stand in
front of a mirror and say...

298
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,875
Here, piggy pig-pig.

299
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:40,347
"Here, piggy pig-pig,"

300
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:41,715
that he'll return for the slaughter.

301
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,584
And have you tried that?

302
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:48,889
Here, piggy pig...

No. But there's
something inside of me

305
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:00,134
that's afraid that I might.

306
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,339
And that scares the hell out of me.

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,784
Sure.
In the meantime, I want you to shave.

312
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,419
In a mirror?
Can you try, Derek?

313
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,154
Yeah.

314
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:21,289
Good.

315
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,026
Call me if you need me.

316
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,661
Okay. Thank you
very much.

317
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:32,700
Dad?

318
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:33,534
Hey, honey.

319
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:35,035
I'm sorry, Daddy.

320
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:37,671
It's all my fault.

321
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,206
What?

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,019
Would you ask her to call me, then?

335
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,921
Vivien Harmon.

336
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:14,857
Okay, thank, thank you.

337
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,692
Hi, Constance.

338
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,194
I'm so sorry

339
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,395
about Adelaide.

340
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:21,597
I've been meaning
to make a condolence call,

341
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,799
and I've just been...

342
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:27,069
Moira tells me that you've
been suffering terribly.

343
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:29,839
That every time you leave
the house, you're racked

344
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,073
with violent morning sickness?

345
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,741
Yeah.

346
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,578
Well, you know, my mother
always recommended

347
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:38,647
a big platter of offal

348
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:41,049
during the first trimester
of pregnancy.

349
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:44,319
She preferred pork.

350
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:46,321
Oh, well, how nice of you

351
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:48,322
to think of me during this...

352
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,360
I believe life is for the
living, don't you?

353
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:54,662
Sweetbreads.

354
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,497
Now these two are thymus
glands, one from the heart,

355
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,566
one from the throat.

356
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,835
And this is the pancreas.

357
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,502
It's so good for mother and child.

358
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,139
Full of protein, vitamin C,

359
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,577
all the B vitamins and iron.

360
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:12,146
And speaking of which...

361
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:14,749
how is your other baby?

362
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:17,519
She was such a dear sweet child,

363
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:21,657
and such a comfort to me
when Addie passed.

364
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:23,526
Well, she's been very upset.

365
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:25,527
Spending a lot of time in her room.

366
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:27,730
Sometimes, children going
through transition

367
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:29,431
just need alone time.

368
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:35,470
Well, I, um, can't thank you
enough for the offal.

369
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,572
Offal.

370
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,777
Moira, why don't you sauté
these for Mrs. Harmon's lunch?

371
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:46,948
Do 'em the way that you used
to do them for me, remember?

372
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,716
With sweet butter.

373
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:51,319
I'd be happy to do that
for Mrs. Harmon.

374
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,357
(chuckles) We need that baby.

375
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,296
We need another...

376
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:03,065
sweet child around here.

377
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,175
May I say something that could
be considered out of turn,

378
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:15,444
but that is sincerely heartfelt?

379
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:16,512
I guess so.

380
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,614
Cheating on one's pregnant wife

381
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:22,685
qualifies as an unspeakable
criminal act.

382
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:24,954
It's on a par with murder.

383
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,756
And I'll tell you one thing I know,

384
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,425
if I know anything at all--

385
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,560
Dr. Harmon will cheat again,

386
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,862
if given half the chance.

387
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,066
I hope I haven't upset you,
speaking my mind so directly.

388
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:44,807
Just a pinch of the sea salt,

389
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,978
a tiny squeeze of the
lemon, if you like.

390
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:52,515
Although I prefer without.
And ma'am,

391
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:56,052
I've left the pancreas uncooked.

392
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,921
They say it's the
tenderest organ of them all,

393
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,055
especially when eaten raw.

394
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:02,059
Oh... Uh, no,

395
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,727
I don't think so, Moira.

396
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,896
Think of the baby.

397
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,542
Mmm.

398
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,111
Mmm.

399
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,698
DEREK: <i>I don't think</i>
<i>I can do this.</i>

400
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,166
Have you been doing the exercises

401
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:42,300
we talked about--

402
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,502
looking in the bathroom
mirror at home?

403
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,971
Yeah, but I cheated.

404
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,173
I used my toaster-- it has
a very reflective surface.

405
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,842
(chuckles) Okay, well, that's a start.

406
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,110
You're in my house now.

407
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,247
And you're safe.

408
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,515
You're safe.

409
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,651
I'm going to stand
right outside this door.

410
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,086
I can't do it.

411
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,489
Here.

412
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:04,957
Use this.

413
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:08,461
But only if you have to.

414
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,164
Breathe...

415
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,401
I'm going to turn off the light.

416
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:17,104
I'm going to close the door,
and I'll be right outside.

417
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,640
Breathe, just breathe.

418
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,309
That's it.

419
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:24,745
Turning off the light.

420
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:28,716
(whimpering)

421
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:31,552
And I'm going to shut the door.

422
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:37,323
(gasping, hyperventilating)

423
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:39,091
Think I'm having a heart attack!

424
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,559
I'm right here, Derek.

425
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:43,329
Five feet away.
Just say the words.

426
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:45,732
Nothing's going to happen.

427
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:55,877
Here, piggy, pig-pig.

428
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:07,122
(gasping):
Here... piggy... pig.

429
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:19,167
(screaming)

430
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:22,805
Derek! Derek, it's okay.
It's okay.

431
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:24,640
There's-there's
something in there!

432
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:26,441
It's okay.

433
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,743
It's okay.

434
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:30,646
(gasps)

435
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:35,284
There's no one in there.
You see?

436
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:36,251
(sobbing)

437
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,021
It's never going to stop.

438
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,324
I'm broken!
No, no, no, no...

439
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,362
I didn't get to the last pig.

440
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:50,132
Over 5,000 amnios, and not
a single miscarriage,

441
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,533
but who's counting?

442
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:54,904
And so this would--
with the Down syndrome...?

443
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:57,807
Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis,
spina bifida.

444
00:23:57,874 --> 00:24:00,475
The amnio results should
put your mind at ease.

445
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:02,444
Sorry I'm late.

446
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,279
Traffic was insane.

447
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:06,181
You didn't have to leave work
to come here.

448
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:07,950
Of course he should.

449
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:09,686
He's the daddy.
That's right, I'm the daddy.

450
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:13,156
We have to be nice to Mommy today.

451
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:14,558
And keep her off her feet.

452
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,961
Will do.

453
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,897
Regina is going to find

454
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:23,067
the perfect spot
so we don't hurt the baby.

455
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:25,436
Right there.

456
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:30,073
You're going to feel a tiny pinch.

457
00:24:37,882 --> 00:24:39,783
I owe you an apology.

458
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:44,053
It attacked you too, didn't it?

459
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,287
No.

460
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:48,324
But I don't know what's real anymore.

461
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:49,892
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

462
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:56,632
The Devil is real.

463
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,301
And he's not a little red man

464
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,670
with horns and a tail.

465
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:03,538
He can be beautiful.

466
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:05,807
Because he's a fallen angel,

467
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,576
and he used to be God's favorite.

468
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:10,111
Have you read the Book of Revelation?

469
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,513
No.

470
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,516
In Heaven, there's this woman in labor

471
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:16,917
howling in pain.

472
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:20,854
And there's a red dragon
with seven heads waiting

473
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,922
so he can eat her baby.

474
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,291
But the Archangel Michael,

475
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,694
he hurls the dragon down to earth.

476
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,663
From that moment on,

477
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:32,967
the red dragon hates the woman,

478
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:37,339
and declares war on her
and all of her children.

479
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,574
That's us.

480
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,615
Oh, yeah, things have
gotten pretty weird for me.

481
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:48,417
Me, too.

482
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:51,653
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

483
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:54,022
The nights are the worst.

484
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,592
I get four hours, if I'm lucky.

485
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,029
That's only with pills.

486
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:03,998
What kind of pills?

487
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:15,892
Can I have one?

488
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,668
They were over by the sofa.

489
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,771
Used to be a row of tables.

490
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,258
I get four or five
of you sickos a year.

491
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:50,676
Usually freshmen.
What, are you a transfer?

492
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,879
You're that teacher.

493
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,314
You're like a hero.

494
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:57,484
Now you know what heroes look like.

495
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,655
Wait, I'm sorry.

496
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:02,721
I'm not like those other kids.

497
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:04,559
I know Tate.

498
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,928
I mean, I know his mom.
We moved next door to her.

499
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:12,067
Did you know him?
Before he did this?

500
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,235
I knew his face.

501
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:16,137
Didn't seem like a bad kid, actually.

502
00:27:16,204 --> 00:27:18,472
He was in here a lot.

503
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,708
Kind of thoughtful, liked to read.

504
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:22,940
Byron, books on birds, random stuff.

505
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,506
Was he bullied or something?

506
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,414
Did he even know the kids he shot?

507
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:32,919
I just want to know why he did it.
Me, too.

508
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:35,756
Why are you bullshitting me?!

509
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:45,432
If the bullet had been
an inch to the right,

510
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,000
it would've missed my spine

511
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,348
and I would have walked out of here.

512
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:50,337
Might have even been able to stop him.

513
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:52,406
An inch higher,
it would have killed me.

514
00:27:52,474 --> 00:27:55,910
Sometimes shit just happens.

515
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:58,011
Good people don't just have a bad day

516
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,413
and start shooting people.

517
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:01,882
Maybe he wasn't a good person.

518
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:10,424
Moira.

519
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:12,959
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

520
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:14,727
You've lost the baby.

521
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:15,862
No, no, no, no.

522
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,365
Oh.

523
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,133
Stop. Stop cleaning
and come sit down.

524
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,436
Have a seat.

525
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:25,472
I'm afraid we're going
to have to let you go.

526
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,008
I don't understand.
The house is spotless.

527
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,743
It has nothing to do with you,
believe me.

528
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,913
Mrs. Harmon,
this is not a job.

529
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,048
For me, coming here is a reprieve.

530
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:37,584
I understand.
We just can't afford it.

531
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:40,153
Then I'll work for free,
till you sell.

532
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:42,122
I'll make the house gleam and
glitter for the new owners.

533
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:44,424
Then, perhaps, they'll hire me.

534
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,959
Mrs. Harmon,
I've had my share of regrets.

535
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:49,995
But leaving an expectant mother
in the time of her need

536
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,463
will not be one of them.

537
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:53,231
I'm staying.

538
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,099
(laughing)

539
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,167
You're being so dramatic.

540
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,669
I'm not helpless, Moira.

541
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,604
Well, I'm not one to belabor a point,

542
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,139
but where has the time gone?

543
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:01,374
You must be famished.

544
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:02,542
I mean, I am hungry.

545
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:05,845
Constance dropped by earlier

546
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,480
with another delicious delicacy.

547
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:08,915
No.

548
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:10,284
I don't want you cooking for me.

549
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:11,785
Please, don't go to the trouble.
Come on.

550
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:14,055
No trouble at all.
It's served raw.

551
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:17,058
So you and the baby get
the full measure of vitamins.

552
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:19,394
It's the most nutritious
organ of them all.

553
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,364
It came from an organic farm.

554
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:26,937
I hear the raw food movement
is really taking off.

555
00:29:27,005 --> 00:29:29,640
For the baby.

556
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,607
♪ ♪

557
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,998
(touchpad beeping)

558
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:41,112
Tate?

559
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,006
Tate?

560
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:12,708
I'm not playing
hide-and-seek, Tate.

561
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,877
You have to leave now!

562
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:17,980
(ghostly laughter)

563
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:19,048
Get out of my house!

564
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:24,188
Look at what he did to me.
(screaming)

565
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:27,992
Excuse me, ma'am,
I don't want to bother you,

566
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,894
but I'm hurt and needing some help.

567
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:33,230
Has my wife medicated you?
Are you here for the procedure?

568
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:51,580
(rock music blaring)

569
00:31:57,254 --> 00:31:58,655
(music stops)

570
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,005
(sobbing)

571
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,075
(gasping, shuddering)

572
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:04,124
Don't you die on me, Violet!

573
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,026
No. Don't you die!

574
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,462
Don't you die on me.

575
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:13,165
Violet!

576
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:15,334
Stay with me.

577
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,705
(gagging)

578
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:28,947
(sobbing)

579
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:35,186
It's okay.

580
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,663
Have you been doing
the cognitive exercises

581
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:46,544
we talked about?

582
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:47,964
Yes. Nothing helps.

583
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,522
I can't take this anxiety.

584
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:52,136
The other night, I meet a girl.

585
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:53,893
Allyson--
works in accounting.

586
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:55,218
There's a real chemistry there.

587
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,659
Derek, that's great.

588
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:59,071
Ask her out.
Get out of your own head.

589
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,770
I... I would love to.

590
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,739
But what happens if she wants
to come home with me some night?

591
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:06,375
How... how do I explain why
all the mirrors are covered up?

592
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:09,678
Derek, you're doing this to yourself.

593
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:12,147
<i>Think of it as the</i>
<i>psychological law of physics.</i>

594
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:15,883
<i>The more you fear something,</i>
<i>the more power you give it.</i>

595
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,652
You need to conquer this thing, Derek.

596
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,920
You're going to go home,

597
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:20,055
you're going to look in the mirror,

598
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,123
and you're going to say those words.

599
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,357
They're not magic words.

600
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:23,892
There is no Piggy Man.

601
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,060
Once you face that,

602
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:26,529
you can finally start to deal

603
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,097
with the real issues in your life.

604
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,900
I mean, you're absolutely right.

605
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,437
I want to do it.

606
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:37,072
I can do it.

607
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,642
The moment you do...

608
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,811
you'll be free.

609
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,080
(bell tolling)

610
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:54,989
Angela?

611
00:34:56,124 --> 00:34:57,124
Vivien.

612
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,567
Thank you so much
for agreeing to meet with me.

613
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:08,003
Of course.

614
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,771
That's, uh, probably close enough.

615
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,076
When you gave me the address,

616
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,511
I didn't realize it was a church.

617
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:16,712
It's where I feel safe.

618
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,181
The hospital said you quit your job,

619
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:20,682
but they didn't say why.

620
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,984
I've been concerned
because of the ultrasound

621
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:25,153
and...

622
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:27,756
They said that the machine
malfunctioned, but...

623
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:30,725
it seemed to me that you
saw something that scared you.

624
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:32,627
Yes, and I've been praying
about it ever since.

625
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:37,833
I saw the unclean thing,
what you carry in your womb.

626
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,202
The plague of nations, the Beast.

627
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:44,006
Okay, so you didn't see anything.

628
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:46,375
So... the machine malfunctioned.

629
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,077
It did not.

630
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:49,712
I saw the little hooves.

631
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:53,148
You need some help.

632
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,688
"And the woman was full of the
filthiness of her fornication!

633
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,290
"The mother of harlots

634
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:01,624
and abominations of the Earth!"

635
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,677
(sighs)

636
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,048
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.

637
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:31,923
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.

638
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:33,926
Pig.

639
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:38,430
(laughs quietly)

640
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:46,873
Here, piggy, piggy, pig.

641
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:48,208
Who you calling a pig?

642
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:50,177
(gun fires)

643
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:52,846
What the hell did you do?

644
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:54,314
This was supposed to be a robbery.

645
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:55,716
Now it's murder, you asshole.

646
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:57,050
Called me a pig.

647
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:58,985
We got to get out of here.

648
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,587
(both chuckling)

649
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,455
I am beginning to think
you're a fraud.

650
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:04,925
And that nail polish is vulgar.

651
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,827
Don't take it out on me just because

652
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:08,895
your dead daughter is mad at you.

653
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:11,064
Now, why the hell
would you say that to me?

654
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,765
Because you're capable
of handling the truth.

655
00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:19,172
I see it all the time.

656
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,108
The dead can hold a grudge

657
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:22,944
better than most Scorpios.

658
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:27,649
I want to talk to her, Billie.

659
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:32,722
I have one last thing...

660
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,291
that I have to say to her.

661
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:42,097
I just miss her so terribly.

662
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,336
She was my reason for living.

663
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:50,138
She says you should have told
her that when she was alive.

664
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:54,108
She's a feisty one.

665
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:00,314
Talk to her.

666
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:03,084
She's here.

667
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:04,987
Come on.

668
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,599
(sighs, chuckles)

669
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:22,137
Baby...

670
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:24,172
I am so sorry.

671
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:30,410
I'm sorry because...

672
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:34,080
most of the time that I was with you,

673
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:35,865
especially when you were younger,

674
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:38,385
I was just so overwhelmed.

675
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:43,190
It wasn't easy being a single parent,

676
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:47,395
and you were such a handful.

677
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:49,665
So I guess I forgot to say

678
00:38:49,732 --> 00:38:51,224
the things that I was supposed to say,

679
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:53,568
but that I honestly

680
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:55,571
always felt in my heart.

681
00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:03,645
I am so proud of you, Addie.

682
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:09,218
I admire you so...
(sighs)

683
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:11,887
for what you were able to overcome.

684
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:17,025
And I think you're beautiful.

685
00:39:18,928 --> 00:39:22,031
Addie, I think you are

686
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:24,866
the most beautiful girl...

687
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:28,103
I ever met.

688
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:35,711
She says thank you.

689
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,183
And that she knows.

690
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,185
And that where she is now,

691
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:45,588
on the other side...

692
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,359
she's a pretty girl at last.

693
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:51,828
(laughs)

694
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:56,266
She also wants you to know
that she's grateful.

695
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:00,470
For not getting her

696
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:02,505
to the lawn at the old house.

697
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:03,906
She doesn't want to be with Tate.

698
00:40:03,974 --> 00:40:05,574
She's afraid of him

699
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:08,277
now that she knows the truth.

700
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,746
CONSTANCE:
<i>Please don't hurt him!</i>

701
00:40:11,814 --> 00:40:13,581
<i>Tate! Tate!</i>

702
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:15,516
Wait! Let me just talk to him!

703
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:17,519
Will you please
just let me talk to him?

704
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:19,254
Tate!

705
00:40:19,322 --> 00:40:20,622
Tate! No, please.

706
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,090
He'll go peacefully.

707
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,925
CONSTANCE:
He's just a child!

708
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:27,162
He's just a child!
Please don't hurt my son.

709
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:29,063
(sirens wailing)

710
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,039
(whispers gunshot sound)

711
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,947
(heavy gunfire)

712
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:00,294
Why did you do it?

713
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:15,344
(sirens wailing, horns blasting)

714
00:41:28,457 --> 00:41:30,258
TATE:
I like birds, too.

715
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:36,799
Why do you like them?

716
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,067
'Cause they can fly away

717
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:39,368
when things get too crazy, I guess.

718
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,306
Are you going to tell your parents?

719
00:41:43,374 --> 00:41:45,376
About the pills?

720
00:41:45,444 --> 00:41:47,679
No.

721
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:49,314
I've been sleeping a lot.

722
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,615
They think I'm depressed.

723
00:41:50,683 --> 00:41:51,683
Are you?
I'm sad.

724
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,119
Me, too.

725
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,089
Violet.

726
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:03,127
Something has changed in you.

727
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:04,462
Toward me.

728
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:08,432
You're distant, cold.

729
00:42:09,168 --> 00:42:11,935
I don't know what I've done,

730
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:13,903
but I'll leave you alone from now on

731
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,271
if that's what you want.

732
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:18,709
Is that what you want?

733
00:42:20,445 --> 00:42:23,014
You know why I'd leave you alone?

734
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,718
Because I care about
your feelings more than mine.

735
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,655
I love you.

736
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:34,961
There, I said it--
not just on some chalkboard.

737
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:40,580
I would never let anybody

738
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,595
or anything hurt you.

739
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:45,044
I've never felt that way about anyone.

740
00:42:53,496 --> 00:42:55,452
Come here.

741
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:12,801
I'm tired.

742
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:17,341
Me too.

743
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:28,656
