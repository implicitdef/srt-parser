<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,609
He is not your friend,
he is the enemy.

3
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:07,337
You let Don talk,
you should know better.

4
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:08,849
The guy's not a salesman.

5
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,332
- Why do we care what that guy wants?
- Because he's a client.

6
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,365
I don't want to live on
the Upper East side.

7
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:16,603
I saw us raising our kids in a place
with more different kinds of people.

8
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:19,541
I don't know what to say.

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,361
Say you're gonna be the first American
to complete a successful heart transplant.

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,183
I could come up and
stay there tonight, if you want.

11
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,764
We'll be fine.

12

13
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,706
Are you sure you don't want
me to order in some food?

14
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,709
- Chinese?
- I'm sorry this is taking so long.

15
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:21,212
It's a common mistake
to not ask questions

16
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,682
when you want something because
you're afraid of the answers.

17
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,784
So you want something?

18
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,385
I'm interested.

19
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:31,288
And considering the precedent
for small agencies,

20
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:33,724
this is how we might
take you public.

21
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:37,227
With one and a half
million shares outstanding

22
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,831
before the offering, we'd sell
400,000 additional shares

23
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,967
to the public at $9 a share.

24
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,903
- 12 a share.
- It's not an insult.

25
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:48,771
Our valuation of your company was
made after careful analysis.

26
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,539
Of papers you spent
20 minutes with?

27
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,909
I can't take this
to the rest of my partners,

28
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,444
but I can take it
to other underwriters.

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,749
I'll need these documents
for 24 hours.

30
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,658
These papers are spotless.
My compliments to the chef.

31
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:13,662
Shall we?

32
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:25,940
You don't think Cooper pushed that
poor banker too hard, do you?

33
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:27,441
We don't want to lose him.

34
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:29,543
Certainly not.

35
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:33,480
It's a marvel.

36
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,381
Everyone wants you, don't they?

37
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:37,083
Pete, no.

38
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:42,488
No, I believe our primary
hurdle has been cleared.

39
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:44,257
And our secondary one?

40
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,926
Don't worry about Don.
Even at nine a share,

41
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:50,229
your part of the company alone
will be worth nearly $1 million.

42
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:55,333
My goodness.

43
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,171
You're flushed.

44
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,641
I drank too fast.

45
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:04,743
I don't think Don
cares about money.

46
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,011
That may be true.
God bless him.

47
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,280
But he's tired of playing
in the bush leagues.

48
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,683
This capitalization
will double our size

49
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,504
and that will turn his head.

50
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,188
You want another?

51
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:20,324
No. I can hardly walk
and you know it.

52
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,995
I hope Clara reminded you
tomorrow's Mother's Day.

53
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,783
Thank you, I'm aware.

54
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:39,208
Ow.

55
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:40,976
Just wanted to make sure
you were still here.

56
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:43,179
I am, but not for long.

57
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,280
You don't even know
what time it is.

58
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:48,350
I do.

59
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:51,220
Because I already got up
and put on my face.

60
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,488
Is that what you do?

61
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:56,091
- I wondered.
- I have to go.

62
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:00,428
Daisy, you're a tease.

63
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:03,331
What more could I give you?

64
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:06,601
Look, the first-class lounge would
be a darker place without you,

65
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,770
but you're supposed to have
your ear to the ground.

66
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:12,206
I feel like you only call me
when you want to see me.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,775
Am I going to see you tomorrow?

68
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:18,678
If there's a flight filled with P&G
executives headed back to Cincinnati.

69
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:21,782
- How about tonight?
- I have plans.

70
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:25,119
Some other boyfriend? The one
you give all the leads to?

71
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,589
With my mother.

72
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:32,024
It's Mother's Day.

73
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:34,227
Don't go.

74
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:37,163
I have to.

75
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,031
But my mother just died.

76
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,797
What are you doing?

77
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,966
You told me you wanted
me here Sunday morning.

78
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:18,769
I'm here.

79
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,639
Peter, don't.

80
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,244
So we'll just maintain every
other aspect of this marriage

81
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,280
except the one that matters.

82
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,247
You mean Tammy?

83
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:35,384
Will you stop holding
the axe over my neck?

84
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,188
So you'd rather I divorce you just
so you know where things stand?

85
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,124
You don't care that I want you.

86
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,993
I've taken note
of your efforts.

87
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:46,929
I'm going to get her.

88
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,865
Well...

89
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:53,067
you're gonna be sorry
when this is over.

90
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:55,370
You've given up on me
at exactly the wrong time.

91
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:57,505
I have big things coming.

92
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,708
You have no idea.

93
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,676
Well, I'll take note
of that, too.

94
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:07,946

95
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,666

96
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:10,743
_

97
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,383

98

99

_

100
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:18,948
_

101
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:23,963
Could you get that?

102
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,103
- Arnold. Come in.
- Hi.

103
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,339
I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you have any wrapping paper?

104
00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:35,640
It's an emergency.

105
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,809
Good morning.

106
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:40,579
Sorry, this is
Megan's mother Marie.

107
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,715
We passed in the lobby.
I thought you were Megan.

108
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,251
Dr. Arnold Rosen
at your service.

109
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,653
- Enchanté.
- <i>Are you French?</i>

110
00:06:48,688 --> 00:06:51,289
My kid's going to Paris.
Should I keep him home?

111
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:54,124
I am French,
but I live in Montreal.

112
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:56,260
And, yes, I believe so.

113
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:58,128
I assume this isn't
a medical emergency.

114
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,197
Mitchell--
that's my son--

115
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,400
he came home and surprised
her for Mother's Day.

116
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:05,102
- How long is he staying?
- Who knows?

117
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,670
I know he thinks a morning stroll
in Central Park is a gift,

118
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:11,173
but Sylvia's gonna
expect an actual gift.

119
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,444
Do you want my flowers?
I'm quite done with them.

120
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,813
Thank you, Mother.

121
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,749
You're a lifesaver.

122
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,722
He's a surgeon. He's working
on heart transplants.

123
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:30,426
Wealthy, talented,
handsome--

124
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,628
I would not leave them alone.

125
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,963
I'm more worried about you.

126
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,867
There's poop
on the stairs again.

127
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:42,470
Somebody's dog got in.

128
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,439
No, it's human.

129
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:46,607
I think it's from the tenant.

130
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,275
She wouldn't do that.

131
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,844
She's a junkie.
She doesn't care.

132
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:51,846
I want her out.

133
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,881
We can't do that.

134
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:59,018
How is your mother?

135
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,756
I got curtains.
She wants to come visit.

136
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,425
Ah!
Ow! Ow.

137
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,126
Jesus.

138
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,695
We have to hire a handyman.

139
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,831
Why?
It's a waste of money.

140
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,998
Because you have no idea
what you're doing.

141
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,851
Herb Rennet called. He's
canceling dinner tonight.

142
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:34,652
That's a relief.

143
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,120
We can still have dinner.

144
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:37,589
I'd love to discuss
some things with you.

145
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:39,757
Let's enjoy our reprieve.

146
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,493
Of course.

147
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,963
Psst.
Close the door.

148
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:50,701
Did he say your dinner
with Jaguar is off?

149
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:53,937
Yes, unless it was the
world's most boring dream.

150
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:56,206
Well, it's on,
but Pete's not invited.

151
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,075
Herb Rennet wants a word alone
to straighten things out.

152
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,610
Why can't you handle it?

153
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:03,078
This could be fatal.
You're going.

154
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:06,148
And my plan is to pack it with
spouses to limit the explosion.

155
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,683
Megan made plans
with her mother.

156
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,018
She thought I had
a business dinner.

157
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:11,453
Marie's in town?
Fantastic.

158
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:14,023
Bring her along.
That's perfect.

159
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:15,857
Tell her I insisted.

160
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,361
In attendance
I have Jim Cutler,

161
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,363
Frank Gleason, and Ted Chaough.

162
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,733
Sweetheart, this is a creative meeting.
What are you doing?

163
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,268
It's for the purposes
of the memorandum.

164
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:30,805
Well, Ted, some men love
women, some love memos.

165
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,306
I want to go over where we are
on Chevrolet again

166
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,308
and devote our final days
to overdoing it

167
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:37,144
on the artwork for
the top three campaigns.

168
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,246
I cannot look at these again.

169
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,415
I told you, they're very keen
on the rocket ship thing

170
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:42,917
with the astronaut anecdotes.

171
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,785
You told them
about the astronauts?

172
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,387
I had to.
It was too vague otherwise.

173
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:48,821
I don't want to draw
any more rockets

174
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,289
and I don't want to stare
at this work again.

175
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,059
We should have never
resigned Alfa Romeo.

176
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,494
What, is this mystery Chevy
gonna be in "The Graduate"?

177
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,095
Those things are
flying off the lot.

178
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,464
Frank, are you not
on board with this?

179
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,232
I love what you're doing.

180
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,303
I'm tired of rockets,
that's all.

181
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:08,306
Could you give us a moment?
We'll continue this later.

182
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,211
What is that, Shalimar?

183
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:19,383
What's gotten into you?

184
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,085
You're supposed to be
calming me down.

185
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,220
Ted, I've got cancer.

186
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,522
What?

187
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,592
In my pancreas.

188
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,225
I told Jim.
I thought he told you

189
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,994
and you didn't want
to embarrass me.

190
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,833
No.

191
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,335
Maybe it's more of
a financial issue to him,

192
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:41,571
but I'm glad he can
keep a secret.

193
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,007
Financial?

194
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,942
The minute I cash out,
I cash in.

195
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,744
You two have to buy me out.

196
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,983
You have cancer.

197
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:56,151
See, if we still had Alfa,
I wouldn't have to worry

198
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:58,353
about putting you
out of business.

199
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,723
First of all,

200
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:04,158
stop talking about money.

201
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,027
Second, we are going
to get Chevy

202
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,295
because you're going
to do your best work.

203
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,364
Third, you're going
to build a wing

204
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:12,867
at Sloan-Kettering
and beat this thing.

205
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,703
Aye, aye.

206
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:25,712
Will you tell Jim you told me?

207
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,914
He'll see it on your face.

208
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,985
Everybody loves astronauts.

209
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,689
I've got to go lie down.

210
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,965
Well, hello there.

211
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,599
How are things in Glocca Morra?

212
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,901
Hello. Can you hear me?

213
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:52,570
I love it when you whisper like that.
What are you wearing?

214
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:54,472
My uniform.

215
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,175
I have one
and his flight's delayed.

216
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,110
Who is he?
What's he do?

217
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:00,779
I'm not sure,

218
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:02,881
but he doesn't believe
my name's really Daisy.

219
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,882
Use that.

220
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,426
Shit.

221
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,166
<i>Do you mind?</i>

222
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,136
17, please.

223
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,677
I'm sorry to bother you,
but we love your show.

224
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,512
Oh, thank you.

225
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,919
Can we get an autograph?

226
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:10,543
I know you're not waving to me.

227
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:12,812
Makes the delay
worthwhile, doesn't it?

228
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:14,748
- Headed to Detroit?
- Eventually.

229
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,415
Should we try LaGuardia?

230
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,517
They already did.
Forget it.

231
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,155
This is why I like
to drive everywhere.

232
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:24,290
I'd live in my car if I could.

233
00:13:24,324 --> 00:13:26,725
You know, with her
in the backseat navigating.

234
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,361
I'm Roger.

235
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:31,029
- What's your name?
- Mikey.

236
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,565
Well, Mikey, since we're
gonna be cell mates,

237
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm going to ask the screw
for a couple of drinks.

238
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,335
Jim Beam.

239
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,604
I'll make her bring them over.

240
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,339
- Good idea.
- I'm full of 'em.

241
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:47,979
I want a glass of water
with an onion

242
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,747
and bring him
a double Jim Beam.

243
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:51,849
And get me on that flight.

244
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:56,998
_

245
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:00,593
This is my day off.
We had plans.

246
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:03,481
_

247
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,836
_

248
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,333
Well, you would rather spend the evening
laughing at Roger Sterling's jokes.

249
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:12,970
I should return home.
I've overstayed my welcome.

250
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,156
_

251
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,512
_

252
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:19,264
_

253
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,093
_

254
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:25,215
Well, I don't know
what's happened.

255
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:27,250
I knew something was wrong.

256
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:30,387
We have not had a fight.

257
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,089
He's so far away

258
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,325
that sometimes
when we're alone,

259
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,928
I feel like
I'm making conversation.

260
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:42,231
Darling, you have confounded
everyone's expectations.

261
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,734
And it is very hard
to stand next to someone

262
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,402
giving an autograph.

263
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:49,472
- He doesn't even care.
- Of course he does.

264
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,708
But he may think you belong more
to other people than to him.

265
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,810
_

266
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,652
_

267
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,800
_

268
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,501
_

269
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,625
_

270
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,370
I love coming into the city.

271
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:25,940
It's 25 minutes,
half hour give or take,

272
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:28,107
from Tenafly
depending on the traffic.

273
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:31,744
I always think I'm gonna
go to museums and stuff.

274
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,046
And there's some good ones.
You've probably seen them.

275
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:37,149
But I always end up at Saks.

276
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:39,251
And I come home

277
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,121
and Herb always says
the same thing.

278
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:45,123
How much damage
did you do, Peaches?

279
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,794
We always do some shopping.

280
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,562
My daughter is very generous.

281
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:53,599
She even invited me along
to this wonderful evening.

282
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,436
You get a hold of Silver Bells?

283
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,573
No. That doesn't mean
he's not coming.

284
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,776
I'm pretty much done waiting.

285
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,712
Perhaps we should go.

286
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:09,346
What?

287
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:12,984
No, I think
we're gonna order now.

288
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:15,852
Herb gets very peckish.

289
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,854
I skipped lunch.

290
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,933
Can I help you, Bert?

291
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,835
You've already done
all you can do.

292
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:34,537
Snapped this place into shape,

293
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:37,306
expanded our business
while keeping it lean.

294
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:40,409
Pending due diligence,
we're done...

295
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:43,512
at $11 a share.

296
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,980
Really?

297
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:47,650
I believe I would like a drink.

298
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,220
What do you drink?

299
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:53,856
Do you have any brandy?

300
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,623
No.

301
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,525
Spirits of elderflower?

302
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,128
No. I don't have
any laudanum either.

303
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:03,765
- Surprise me.
<i>- Night, chief.</i>

304
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,700
Bob, could you get Joan?

305
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,736
- And some ice.
- Absolutely.

306
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,675
When do we break the news?

307
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,711
Call the meeting for tomorrow.

308
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,649
Ahh.

309
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:26,352
So there she was in the garage

310
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:29,221
right among the-- you know,
there's an oil stain

311
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:31,924
that Herb's been meaning
to take care of--

312
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,594
there she is, our little puppy,

313
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:36,996
with a full litter.

314
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,487
_

315
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,375
_

316
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,617
_

317
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:46,671
You're right, Mother. They
must have been adorable.

318
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:49,741
There's one yellow
and one brown

319
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:51,810
and then three sort of mixed.

320
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:54,779
Each one at its own nipple.

321
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,448
I love puppies.

322
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,016
Not the way she does.

323
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,026
_

324
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:05,856
You know what?
Why don't we let the men

325
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,792
discuss the business they're
probably here to talk about

326
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:10,728
while we powder our noses?

327
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:23,572
Tall and tan
and young and lovely.

328
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:31,613
So why are we here, Herb?

329
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:35,150
Oh, it's nothing serious.
I just had an idea.

330
00:18:35,184 --> 00:18:37,786
There's a kid who's been
writing fliers for me

331
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,955
at a few of my lots

332
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:42,423
and I'm really getting results.

333
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,693
He's got a good turn of phrase.

334
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,427
I think you'd appreciate it.

335
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,428
Is he looking for a job?

336
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:50,464
No, he's got a job.

337
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:54,001
I just thought that
it might help you and me

338
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:55,903
if he were to take a look
at some of your work,

339
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,638
even at the formative stages,

340
00:18:57,673 --> 00:18:59,740
just to get his take on it.

341
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:04,443
What's his name?

342
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,580
Fawcett.

343
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,784
Chris Fawcett.

344
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:15,655
Here you go.

345
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,291
- What is this?
- It's the name of the guy

346
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,926
who's going to be handling
your account from now on.

347
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,030
You never fail
to overheat, do you?

348
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:28,633
You know the somersaults I'm
doing 'cause you're so touchy?

349
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,936
Really?
A man your size?

350
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,006
You know what?

351
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,374
Your whole company should
be taken to the woodshed.

352
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,643
First Campbell
gives me the sass.

353
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,180
Then Sterling,
he didn't even show up.

354
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,750
And you-- huh, yeah--
my friend,

355
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,719
you're gonna
be working for him.

356
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,353
And he could
teach you something

357
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,521
like knowing where
your bread is buttered.

358
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:54,124
Why don't you get this?

359
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,426
I want you to buy me
one last meal.

360
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,394
I'm tired of taking it
out of your account.

361
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:00,030
Okay.

362
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:02,065
And if you ever
see Sterling again,

363
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,134
tell him you screwed up

364
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:06,069
'cause I'm done
with all of youse.

365
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,707
Don't sit down.
Dinner's over.

366
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:14,009
Are you okay?

367
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:19,115
Never felt better in my life.

368
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:26,788
Nice meeting you.
See you soon.

369
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,801
My mother needs an aspirin.

370
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,803
I don't care.

371
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,491
- Hello?
- Marie.

372
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:08,094
It's Roger.
I'm so glad I got you.

373
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:10,429
If you are calling
to apologize, don't bother.

374
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:12,864
- It's too late. Good night.
- Hold on, hold on, don't hang up.

375
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:16,168
- Let me talk to Don.
- Did you call to talk to Don?

376
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:19,938
Yes, but I was hoping you were there.
You were next, I swear.

377
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:22,140
<i>You dragged me out</i>
<i>and made me sit</i>

378
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:25,577
with that disgusting man
with his disgusting wife.

379
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:28,245
She is the apple that goes
in the pig's mouth.

380
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,782
Marie, I swear I wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

381
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:33,284
It's just something came up,

382
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,720
something very important

383
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,422
that I need to talk
to Don about.

384
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:40,558
You are speaking slowly
so I will understand?

385
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,827
Forget... my... name.

386
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,942
Excuse me.

387
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:01,610
Is it possible for me
to pay for my friend?

388
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:05,948
Yes, but
it's too late for that.

389
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:08,317
What are you bugging him for?

390
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:10,386
Aren't I enough for you?

391
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,955
This is my friend. What
was your fake name again?

392
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,190
Curious George?

393
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:17,459
You're a riot.

394
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,474
Hello.

395
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,176
Good night.

396
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:42,249
Isn't that guy a client?

397
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:44,385
Is he gone?

398
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:46,219
Yes.

399
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,819
I have a high-level
accounts question.

400
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,487
A hypothetical.

401
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:57,589
So it doesn't involve
anybody in this room?

402
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:04,329
Let's say you caught your father-in-law
in a compromising position.

403
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:07,532
It's every Sunday night.
The guy can't hold his liquor.

404
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:17,374
Last night I was celebrating
at that party house up on Lex

405
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:20,210
and I saw my father-in-law
exit the bedroom

406
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:22,212
with the biggest,

407
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:24,981
blackest prostitute
you've ever seen.

408
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:29,885
Was there anyone else
from Vicks there?

409
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,022
Not that I saw.
But we spoke.

410
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:36,959
I mean, all I said
was hello, but--

411
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:40,530
Okay, look,
when I was in high school,

412
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:43,532
they had this picture come to the
only movie theater in Cabot.

413
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:45,300
It was called
"Making A Baby."

414
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,135
They invited women
and men separately,

415
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,071
but it was a delivery system
for some filthy stuff.

416
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:52,574
So at the matinee, I look over

417
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:55,610
and Mr. Miller my science
teacher is five seats away.

418
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:59,380
And he's not, you know, working
the slide rule or anything,

419
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:02,216
but we see each other for sure.

420
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,486
But we both knew that neither
of us should be there.

421
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,989
It was mutually
assured destruction.

422
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,592
So he's not going
to say anything?

423
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,527
He can't.

424
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:16,028
<i>Mr. Cosgrove,
I have a phone call.</i>

425
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:18,231
Give me a second.

426
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:20,266
It's why I don't worry
about the bomb.

427
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:22,168
<i>It's urgent.</i>

428
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:24,804
<i>I have Hugh Hibbert</i>
<i>and John Echolls from Jaguar.</i>

429
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,674
Why are they calling you?
Pick it up.

430
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:31,843
This is Ken.

431
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:34,846
Good morning.

432
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,649
Do you have any idea where Roger
has been for the last 24 hours?

433
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,719
- I don't.
- Draper!

434
00:24:40,753 --> 00:24:42,821
What in the hell have you--

435
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:47,525
- What?
- You have done it again.

436
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,193
What did you say
to Herb Rennet last night?

437
00:24:49,228 --> 00:24:51,095
Nothing that shouldn't have
been said last Christmas.

438
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:52,597
As usual, you have
acted impulsively

439
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:54,565
and harmed the company
irreparably.

440
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,768
- Pete, calm down.
- We'd already lost the account.

441
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:59,604
He was gonna bring in
some kid to write copy.

442
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:01,606
That's because you
screwed him last time.

443
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,373
You couldn't wait.

444
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:06,243
Pete, you've got to
understand when it's over.

445
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:08,278
Do you know that we had
a public offering underway?

446
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:09,713
And now it's ruined!

447
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:14,050
- What?
- You don't care about the company.

448
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:15,885
- You're already rich.
- Not here.

449
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,054
Inside.

450
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,693
- What is going on?
- Why the hell didn't I know about this?

451
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:26,862
- We're going public?
- Not anymore.

452
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:29,064
- When did that happen?
- I was going to tell you this morning.

453
00:25:29,098 --> 00:25:31,700
I tried to last night, but you'd
rather have dinner with Herb Rennet.

454
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,636
Well, I have some good news
and some bad news.

455
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,337
- Where the hell have you been?
- Don fired Jaguar.

456
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:37,338
What?

457
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:42,577
Then I just have good news.
We're giving a presentation

458
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:45,045
this Friday on Chevy's
top secret new car.

459
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,914
- What?
- Friday?

460
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,783
Come on, you've been thinking
about Chevy your whole life.

461
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:51,752
- Are you serious?
- And I have this check for $10,000

462
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:55,155
because I close, Pete.
I close things.

463
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,890
Did I mention I was in Detroit

464
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:59,459
where my friend Mikey O'Brien--
look him up--

465
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:01,595
said he was looking for
something cutting-edge,

466
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,297
but none of the agencies
had it?

467
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:05,965
So he had a great idea.
Bring us in.

468
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,933
We're not afraid of a deadline.

469
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,569
Holy crap.
Chevy.

470
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:12,171
You want to go public?

471
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:13,806
How much better is it
when we have Chevy?

472
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,408
Don't act like you had a plan.

473
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:17,743
You're Tarzan
swinging from vine to vine.

474
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,379
Roger, I want to know everything.
Pete, go box up Jaguar.

475
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,247
Make sure they have
all their files today.

476
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:24,215
Joan, get the creatives
in my office.

477
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,050
Get them yourself.

478
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,254
Don't you feel
300 pounds lighter?

479
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,324
I don't.

480
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:35,293
Honestly, Don, if I could deal
with him, you could deal with him.

481
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,929
And what now?

482
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:40,931
I went through
all of that for nothing?

483
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,835
Joan, don't worry.
I will win this.

484
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,737
Just once

485
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,406
I would like to hear
you use the word "we."

486
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,710
Because we're all rooting
for you from the sidelines,

487
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,379
hoping that you'll decide whatever
you think is right for our lives.

488
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,559
In my office, all of you.

489
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:12,026
Should we go in there?

490
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:14,229
I don't care.

491
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,268
XP-887.

492
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:22,404
- So we get to name it?
- Possibly.

493
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:24,439
For now it's all
cloak-and-dagger.

494
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:26,140
They've got a room full
of R&D on this.

495
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:28,342
But it boils down
to Chevrolet's top brass

496
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:30,444
trying to build
the perfect car.

497
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:33,213
- They designed it with a computer.
- So they're scared.

498
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,516
They run another agency in
at the one-yard line.

499
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,017
They're terrified.

500
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:38,252
So who else is in it?

501
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:40,488
Well, the guest list limping in

502
00:27:40,522 --> 00:27:43,423
is as follows--
Campbell-Ewald.

503
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:45,725
Chevy's right arm. They got
200 people in Detroit.

504
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample

505
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:49,328
and Cutler Gleason and Chaough.

506
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:52,465
Ha, fantastic. Two
steamships and a rowboat.

507
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,435
You had to write that down?

508
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:57,771
- There's no pictures.
- It's a GM car.

509
00:27:57,805 --> 00:27:59,271
It's got four wheels
and an engine.

510
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:02,274
No, it's totally new.

511
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,811
I want you to go to the library

512
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:07,413
and get me everything
you can on Mustang.

513
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,481
- And Chevy.
- No, forget that.

514
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:11,249
They know there's been
nothing before Mustang

515
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:13,385
and nothing after it, but
they're hoping it's this.

516
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,387
No one and nothing
leaves my office.

517
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:19,189
How about that?

518
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:21,091
How 'bout it?

519
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,103
Are you okay?

520
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,307
I just wanted to watch "Hazel,"

521
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,042
but I can't get any reception.

522
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:48,884
I think you should go home.

523
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,420
I love how you work every account
like it's make or break.

524
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:53,422
I need some of that right now.

525
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:55,491
You've been working plenty.

526
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,726
I have a new way to go.

527
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:00,696
I'd show it to you, but it's top
secret and it may be terrible.

528
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,998
Maybe Frank's right.

529
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,334
We should have
never dumped Alfa.

530
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,803
It's one thing to want something,
it's another to need it.

531
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:10,939
This is your agency.

532
00:29:10,974 --> 00:29:13,842
You're always going
to need something.

533
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,910
Don't let Frank Gleason
make you question it.

534
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:18,046
Well, it's Frank's agency,
too, Peggy.

535
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,681
And I've been counting on his
paintbrush and his negativity

536
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,683
to balance me out for 20 years.

537
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,151
Fine.

538
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:28,089
But I've spent a lot of time

539
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:30,124
working with pessimistic people

540
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:33,127
and I like the fact
that you're--

541
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:34,928
Do not say I'm nice.

542
00:29:34,963 --> 00:29:37,230
I hate it when people
say I'm nice.

543
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:41,234
I was going to say strong.

544
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:57,049
I'm sorry.

545
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,018
I'm just grateful.

546
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:03,655
No, of course.

547
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:10,528
Good night, Peggy.

548
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,668
Yes.

549
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,537
Good night.

550
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,970
<i>Hold that.</i>

551
00:30:33,473 --> 00:30:36,274
I got it.

552
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:38,842
You want to go celebrate?
I just quit my job.

553
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:42,246
What? Really?

554
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:44,382
I had a heart and a kid
who needed the heart

555
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,949
and now they're both dead.

556
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:47,918
I'm not gonna get
the opportunity.

557
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:51,055
I'm tired of fighting.

558
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,090
Well, you're fighting
God in a way.

559
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:54,725
Oh, bullshit.

560
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,860
You don't think
God's in Houston?

561
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:58,696
My hospital chickened out

562
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,732
and now some asshole down
there is taking my place

563
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:04,301
in history while I piss away
my life in New York City.

564
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:07,137
You can't think that way.

565
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:09,739
Fate hasn't chosen me.

566
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:12,374
Look...

567
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:16,245
I don't cut people open.
I don't believe in fate.

568
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,848
You make your own
opportunities.

569
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:21,818
You sure you don't want
to go for a drink?

570
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:24,652
I got work.

571
00:31:34,163 --> 00:31:37,432
- How'd it go?
- I don't know.

572
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:39,201
I was gonna sleep on it,

573
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:41,969
but now I think I'm just
gonna shower and go back in.

574
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:48,776
I love you like this.

575
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,711
Desperate and scared?

576
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:53,147
Fearless.

577
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:55,049
And I want to do whatever I can

578
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,316
to make sure you do not fail.

579
00:31:57,351 --> 00:32:00,019
Then you can jump
from the balcony

580
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:02,622
and fly to work like Superman.

581
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,274
Will there be anything else?

582
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,109
No, thank you, Daisy.

583
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:27,712
Actually, can you
get those lugs

584
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:29,613
from Dancer
bumped off the flight?

585
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:33,084
Roger, I told you,
I can't hurt the company.

586
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,153
They bought most of the seats.

587
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,455
Jesus, there's like
eight of them.

588
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,293
Surprised to see you here.

589
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,894
Taking your kid
to look at colleges?

590
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,263
No, taking him
to pick out a car.

591
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,899
Oh. When did they add
you guys to the mix?

592
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,400
When they saw your work.

593
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,869
I wish you the best of luck.

594
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,072
In fact,
maybe we shouldn't even go.

595
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,841
What are the billings
for Vicks?

596
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,575
Nine million? Someone's
gonna pick that up.

597
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,016
Any of you have a cough drop?

598
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,518
I know they don't.

599
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:15,691
Get him on the phone right now
or I'm coming over there.

600
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:17,591
I've got it, Clara.

601
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:19,460
Roger's calling
from the airport.

602
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:21,196
He says something happened
with Vick Chemical.

603
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,431
Tell my father-in-law
I am not joking.

604
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:25,566
Believe me, you do not
want me in your lobby.

605
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,535
Let me talk to Roger.

606
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,370
So it's true?

607
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:31,539
No, I'm gonna fix it.

608
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:35,142
Jesus, they don't need
to hear this right now.

609
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:37,244
Roger will handle it.

610
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,621
- Well?
- They're screwing with us.

611
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:50,657
Really?

612
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:52,492
Daisy's gonna lose
their luggage.

613
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:12,277
Well, apparently you
didn't get any of my calls.

614
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,045
So I came down here
to your lair.

615
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,114
Spare me the outrage, Pete.

616
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:17,649
I'm tired of it.

617
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:23,988
Tom, what are you doing?

618
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,858
I know we're both
emotional and vulnerable,

619
00:34:26,892 --> 00:34:28,626
but I'm not the enemy here.

620
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,895
I'm an adult, as are you.

621
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:33,398
And if anything,
our relationship

622
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:35,400
has shown over
the last seven years

623
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:38,334
that I have
a very short memory.

624
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:41,405
Now, what can I do

625
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,972
to bring you back to reality

626
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,341
in this obviously
impulsive decision?

627
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,945
My daughter is a princess.

628
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:52,015
She could have had anyone.

629
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:55,017
I knew there was a reason
you never wanted children.

630
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,153
You have no business
being a father.

631
00:34:58,187 --> 00:35:01,290
You just pressed
the button, Tom.

632
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:03,258
You just blew everything up.

633
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:06,729
Well, it makes me sick
thinking about the man I saw

634
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:08,863
being with my daughter
and my granddaughter.

635
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,665
Why don't you look
in the mirror?

636
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:13,000
You can walk out like a man

637
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,670
or I can have you thrown out
like the lowlife you are.

638
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:23,210
If I have as low character
as you say,

639
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:24,711
why would you
push me like this?

640
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:26,513
You'll do the right thing.

641
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:36,757
The paint fumes
are making me sick.

642
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,960
I got the windows open.

643
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,727
It'll be dry
in a couple of days.

644
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,563
And when am I gonna
be able to walk around

645
00:35:43,597 --> 00:35:45,498
my apartment in bare feet?

646
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:47,400
Soon.
We're fixing it up.

647
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:50,136
In here, yes.
But out there?

648
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:52,372
Those kids are living
on our stoop

649
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:55,575
lighting firecrackers
and playing their music.

650
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,509
And you keep waving to them.

651
00:35:57,543 --> 00:35:59,544
Look, the neighborhood
is changing.

652
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,013
We're a part of that.

653
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,514
I don't like change.

654
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:04,183
I want everything to stay
the way it was.

655
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:05,985
I don't think
you understand, babe.

656
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:09,388
Everything's getting better.
Johnson's gone.

657
00:36:09,422 --> 00:36:11,290
The war is gonna end.

658
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:13,358
We're gonna have a new
president no matter what.

659
00:36:13,392 --> 00:36:16,461
Maybe McCarthy.
Worst case, Kennedy.

660
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:19,063
I love Bobby Kennedy.

661
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:21,099
<i>Fine.</i>

662
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:27,138
If that's what you want.

663
00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:31,541
I just want you to kiss me.

664
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:13,253
Damn it.

665
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,425
Hello to you, too.

666
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:19,760
What the hell
are you doing in Detroit?

667
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:23,162
My doctor recommended
an ocean voyage.

668
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:25,197
Can I get one of those?

669
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:26,933
I don't believe this.

670
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:29,335
I spent six weeks
on this pipe dream

671
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:31,604
and it's gonna be over
in two seconds.

672
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:35,575
Hell, I knew I was good,

673
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:37,943
but I didn't know
all I had to do was show up.

674
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:40,178
You don't know what this means?

675
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:44,416
It's not my job
to put you at ease,

676
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,017
but just because
they brought us in

677
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:47,586
at the last second
doesn't mean you're dead.

678
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,521
Me?
We're both dead.

679
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:52,758
I've had enough
psychological warfare today.

680
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,592
- Why don't you take a table?
- Think about it.

681
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:57,495
When it's two top 10 agencies
and me, I've got a chance.

682
00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:00,197
Now that there's two
little guys, we're DOA.

683
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:02,867
I'm not worried.
I've got great work.

684
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:05,970
Of course you do. And mine's
even better, I guarantee.

685
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:08,372
You know how this works. They're
gonna take our creative

686
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:10,807
and give it to one
of the big boys.

687
00:38:10,842 --> 00:38:14,143
Second place, tied with last.

688
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:18,748
Come on, you know I'm right.

689
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:21,518
So they want a name brand.

690
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:23,487
- We had a car.
- So did we.

691
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:27,756
It's not the same thing.

692
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,492
It's the size of the team.

693
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:31,226
It's opening an office
in Detroit.

694
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,895
This is General Motors.

695
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:34,964
They fight the war
with bodies on the ground.

696
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:38,400
I saw Dancer at the airport.

697
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:40,836
Looked like half my office.

698
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:46,774
This business is rigged.

699
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:50,879
Damn it.

700
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,814
That's what I said.

701
00:38:52,848 --> 00:38:54,716
Sorry about that.

702
00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:58,886
I'm tired of this crap.

703
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,989
I should just let Chevy buy
my brain and put it in a jar.

704
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:03,289
Can I get another?

705
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:06,560
Brain in a jar.

706
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,629
Put it on your tombstone.

707
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:12,933
"Here lies SCDP,

708
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,568
the little company
with the big ideas."

709
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:19,539
"CGC, giving away creative
one car at a time."

710
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:25,144
So what did you go with?

711
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:28,414
What, I show you mine,
you show me yours?

712
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:31,016
What's the difference
at this point?

713
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,251
You first.

714
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:35,554
Okay, but I've got to stand up.

715
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:43,728
This is a car for the young
and the young at heart.

716
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:46,463
Because today nobody knows
where they're headed,

717
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:48,632
but they're not afraid
of what's around the bend.

718
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:51,869
Power plus design
equals adventure.

719
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:55,372
Throw the map out the window
and hit the road, Jack.

720
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:56,941
Then I sing the song.

721
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:03,312
- That's good.
- No kidding.

722
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,586
Just music.
People's faces.

723
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,889
All kinds-- teenagers,
dads, moms.

724
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:15,592
Different expressions
of wonder.

725
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:18,426
What could this possibly be?

726
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:20,128
It's so new,

727
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:23,632
this combination of power,

728
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,901
technology, comfort, and price

729
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:28,870
that it's impossible
to imagine.

730
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:33,241
But not at Chevy.

731
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,009
The future

732
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:37,344
is something you haven't
even thought of yet.

733
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:42,149
You run that for a week,

734
00:40:42,183 --> 00:40:44,351
then you finally show the car.

735
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,923
That's interesting.

736
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:51,958
Hooray.

737
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,500
So should we go home?

738
00:41:05,872 --> 00:41:08,273
We--

739
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:10,275
that's interesting.

740
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,277
Why, you want to stay
just so Chevy

741
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:14,146
can put a feather in your cap?

742
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:17,215
I have a better idea.

743
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,951
No, you don't.
I just heard it.

744
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:20,719
This is why everyone hates you.

745
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:23,287
Think about it.

746
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:26,958
Both of us have the creative,

747
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:29,260
but neither of us
have an agency to match.

748
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,733
Why would I do that?

749
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:37,601
Because we're dead.

750
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:42,072
Even if I were to consider
that, Chevy calls the shots.

751
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:45,008
Hey, Lieutenant,

752
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:47,510
want to get into some trouble?

753
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:49,512
How would that even work?

754
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:53,150
Well, one of us, probably me,

755
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:55,885
will have to figure out
a way to make Chevy

756
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:57,753
think it was their idea
to combine our agencies.

757
00:41:57,788 --> 00:42:00,990
And then the other one,
let's say it was you,

758
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:03,425
will have to figure out what the
hell we're going to present.

759
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:05,861
Well, we have partners.

760
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:09,565
Who aren't sitting in this bar.

761
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,733
Can I get another?

762
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:15,804
No, we're done.

763
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:21,542
We've got a long night.

764
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:29,282
<i>♪ My eyes were on the sparrow ♪</i>

765
00:42:29,317 --> 00:42:31,618
<i>♪ My feet were on the ground ♪</i>

766
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:34,054
<i>♪ I used to walk</i>
<i>the straight and narrow ♪</i>

767
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:36,090
<i>♪ Never fly around ♪</i>

768
00:42:36,124 --> 00:42:38,058
<i>♪ Till one night at a party ♪</i>

769
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:40,060
<i>♪ I met you,</i>
<i>Baby Jane... ♪</i>

770
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:43,229
I want to make it clear,

771
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:45,798
unless this works,
I'm against it.

772
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,834
I was just saying
the same thing.

773
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,203
Shall we?

774
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,271
After you.

775
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,059
You're not supposed to be
here till the weekend.

776
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,128
I don't like you surprising me.

777
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:19,263
Sit down, Trudy.

778
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,773
Did you know your father
pulled his business?

779
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,741
No.

780
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,777
And I don't care, Peter.

781
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,579
You understand that we were
going to be very rich,

782
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,946
but he's ruined that.

783
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,283
He's done everything for you.

784
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,618
He's a hypocrite, Trudy.

785
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,154
Don't you dare
criticize my father.

786
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,327
I guess it doesn't matter

787
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:53,262
that I caught him
in a Midtown whorehouse.

788
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:55,697
Just stop it right now.

789
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:59,100
It's true. With a 200-pound
Negro prostitute.

790
00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:02,036
Ask him to his face.

791
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,339
You'll say anything
to hurt me, won't you?

792
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:06,140
He wanted it this way.

793
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:07,676
He left me no other choice.

794
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,277
You had lots of choices, Peter.

795
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:12,346
We're done.
Get your things.

796
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:25,958
<i>Mr. Chaough
wants to see you.</i>

797
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:28,761
- He's back?
- <i>That's all I know.</i>

798
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:43,208
So, how'd it go?

799
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:46,578
We got it.
We won Chevy.

800
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:51,049
What are you doing here?

801
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:53,084
We went in together.

802
00:44:53,118 --> 00:44:54,919
What?

803
00:44:54,954 --> 00:44:56,655
What are you talking about?

804
00:44:56,689 --> 00:44:58,756
They wanted our ideas
and a big agency,

805
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,290
so we gave them both.

806
00:45:01,693 --> 00:45:03,761
Just for Chevy?

807
00:45:03,795 --> 00:45:05,863
No, we merged--

808
00:45:05,897 --> 00:45:07,898
furniture, fixtures,
everything.

809
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,769
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

810
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:16,339
I did this wrong once before,

811
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:18,842
so let me tell you
how great it's going to be

812
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:20,910
and you can decide
if you want to come along.

813
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:23,212
You are the copy chief

814
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:25,582
at one of the top 25
ad agencies in the country.

815
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:28,284
You're not even 30.
I'm jealous.

816
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:34,590
I just bought an apartment.

817
00:45:35,592 --> 00:45:37,393
Congratulations.

818
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:44,833
Are we moving?

819
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:48,103
We are, and we'd like you
to write the press release.

820
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:50,372
For what?

821
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:52,407
We don't have a name yet,

822
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:55,110
but make it sound
like the agency

823
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:56,677
you want to work for.

824
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:01,816
Who do I give it to?

825
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,583
Give it to Ted.

826
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:26,672

827
