1
00:01:52,518 --> 00:01:54,782
The entire hill looks like
osmanthus flower cake!

2
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:56,521
Stop nonsense!

3
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:59,816
Will you ever starve back in the capital?

4
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,219
Take it.

5
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,174
Brother Gao, a bandit's hideout
is found three miles ahead!

6
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,610
It's true! What a surprise!

7
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:25,306
Legend has it that
the Desert Camels have killed

8
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:28,578
so many that even their blades
have turned black.

9
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:32,983
Predict it.

10
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,997
The west the will of God,
the north the barbaric...

11
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,531
Commander... let's hurry.

12
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,202
It is fortune or misfortune?

13
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,940
It's neither fortune or misfortune.

14
00:03:58,243 --> 00:03:59,801
Hey... come on!

15
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,204
Go!

16
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,573
Beauty...

17
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:34,979
are you hungry?

18
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:40,615
What would you like to eat?

19
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:48,953
Congratulations, boss...

20
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:58,132
Say it and I'll get you whatever you want!

21
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,073
Really?

22
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:07,870
Really. My heart is now yours.

23
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,943
Hey, caught it.

24
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,495
It's on fire...

25
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:07,667
Sneak attack! Chase them...

26
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,068
Shoot!

27
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,538
Come on! I'll take you away!

28
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:26,315
Come on!

29
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:31,984
Hold me tight!

30
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,393
Sacrifice our lives!

31
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,466
For the sake of our parents!

32
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:50,539
Spill our blood!

33
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:53,677
For the sake of our home!

34
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,243
Walk a million miles!

35
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:59,474
And kill the bandits of the desert!

36
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:02,812
To save the beauty!

37
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:07,591
Put on our golden armors!

38
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:20,003
They're back!
They're back! General is back!

39
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,444
You're grown up!

40
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,959
We saved her halfway.

41
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:51,825
Her parents are dead.

42
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:51,226
Why disappeared?

43
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,669
Someone's knocking the door?

44
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:13,216
Open the door.

45
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,371
Mistress!

46
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,799
Mistress!

47
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,170
Can't we just send him to an inn?

48
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:41,106
Bullshit!

49
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:46,181
We're brothers.

50
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:49,047
And it's New Year.

51
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,752
Who?

52
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:55,456
He's back.

53
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:03,765
You're all here.

54
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:04,731
Miss Xiaowei.

55
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,370
It's so cold outside.

56
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:07,230
- Drink some hot water.
- Give it to me!

57
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,701
Have some osmanthus flower cakes!

58
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:09,969
Okay, thank you.

59
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:11,105
Thanks, Miss Xiaowei.

60
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,206
Brother Gao Xiang, drink while it's hot.

61
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:15,242
So attentive.

62
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,215
Who is this man?

63
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:26,351
He...

64
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:10,624
Right there!

65
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,510
General...

66
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:30,578
General...

67
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:31,749
General, are you okay?

68
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,247
Why didn't you wait for us?

69
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,850
General...

70
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:36,020
Have you gone mad?

71
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:38,411
Hundreds of gangsters here!

72
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,048
You said

73
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,824
we're all brothers who'd die together.

74
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,292
We must go home all alive!

75
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:05,471
I'll never lead you.

76
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:09,916
Brother Yong

77
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,586
- General... - Brother Yong.

78
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,121
General, are you okay...

79
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:15,087
- General... - Brother Yong.

80
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,760
General...

81
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,528
Freeze!

82
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:20,796
You won't!

83
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,530
A soldier like you can't go as you wish!

84
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,032
This is desertion...

85
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,464
and the penalty is death!

86
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:27,433
No!

87
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,731
No...

88
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,872
Get away!

89
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:30,937
Leave me!

90
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:38,846
Everybody, take care.

91
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:47,315
- General... - Brother Yong.

92
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,794
Have you contacted him?

93
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:32,369
No.

94
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:34,535
Don't you want him to come back?

95
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,598
Of course I do!

96
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,006
Perhaps he can catch the guy...

97
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,474
who tore the man's heart out.

98
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:48,847
I just never thought

99
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,315
he'd been dejected like this.

100
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:57,718
We're married already.
How about letting him stay?

101
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:11,464
Do you know?

102
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:14,402
I've been worried about you every day.

103
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,407
Be careful.

104
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:57,605
I won't eat it. Go give others to share.

105
00:18:58,076 --> 00:18:59,008
Thank you, Miss Xiaowei.

106
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,045
Really won't eat?

107
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,109
No, I won't.

108
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,747
Then I'm going.

109
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:37,578
I've sliced them for you from six humans.

110
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:41,612
Why killed so many?
How to eat them all at once?

111
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:45,047
For you to choose. It's just a few.

112
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,755
I don't mean to feel bad for them.

113
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,690
But you've made a lot of work
for Wang Sheng.

114
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:53,930
I hardly see him these days.

115
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:56,623
You can simply kill his wife!

116
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,302
You're so disgusting.

117
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:13,484
Who is it from?

118
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,649
Young master of Golden Restaurant.

119
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,887
That fatso.

120
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,085
And this?

121
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,363
Foreman of the dyehouse.

122
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,724
He's ugly!

123
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:32,999
It's said that the uglier the human heart...

124
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:35,933
the better to be ultimate in black magic.

125
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,070
If you want a pretty heart,
try Wang Sheng's one.

126
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,172
You're wasting your time.

127
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,213
We've been here for nearly three months.

128
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:49,344
He will love me.

129
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:54,585
I don't believe
I'll lose to that stupid woman!

130
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:56,223
Why don't you just be his concubine?

131
00:20:56,427 --> 00:21:00,158
Concubine? Why do I need to be?

132
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:03,133
What I want to be is his wife.

133
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:08,998
Listen. I shall be Mrs. Wang.

134
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:14,973
So you want to give up your training?

135
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:17,070
I have plenty of time.

136
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,714
But your skin won't wait.

137
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:21,183
You need more hearts...

138
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:23,076
to keep your human skin from rotting.

139
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:29,324
Sure! Therefore,
I've got to find a way out

140
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:33,720
so I can stop myself eating such gross!

141
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:13,460
Not woken up yet?

142
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,640
No.

143
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,948
Let me get you some tea.

144
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:37,521
Peirong. I haven't slept a wink for days.

145
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,933
Peirong... I've drunk too much!

146
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,434
Brother Yong.

147
00:22:50,174 --> 00:22:51,038
You've woken up.

148
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:05,219
Sorry.

149
00:23:09,994 --> 00:23:10,858
Thanks.

150
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:12,591
I'm going!

151
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:15,226
Brother Yong.

152
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:25,206
Hey brother,

153
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:27,869
It's New Year's Eve. At least stay...

154
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,171
with us for the...

155
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,369
No, thanks!

156
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,643
Brother Yong, just wait a moment.

157
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:35,751
I've got something to return to you.

158
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:54,737
Brother Yong, your sword.

159
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:07,718
Wish you good luck.

160
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:30,132
I just wondered where you've gone.

161
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:35,935
So righteous that you haven't left me alone.

162
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:46,720
Brother Yong...

163
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:49,389
We've just come to the commander's house
to fine you!

164
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:52,018
Stop it. Get me some food.

165
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,358
Okay, okay...

166
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:55,122
Give me...

167
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:58,762
Brother Yong,
where've you been for the last two years?

168
00:24:58,969 --> 00:24:59,993
Sure! Where?

169
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:03,135
Brother Yong.

170
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:07,005
Have you suddenly come back for anything?

171
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:10,480
What's happened here?

172
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:14,951
Nothing...

173
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:19,311
Waiter, any spare room?

174
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,079
Yes, sure...

175
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:25,387
Please pay a deposit
at the counter first, sir.

176
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,819
I'm leaving my horse here,

177
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:28,157
and you think I'll run away?

178
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,334
Okay, fine...

179
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:35,901
Waiter, don't forget to look
after my horse!

180
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:39,608
I will, I guarantee. Rest assured!

181
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,325
Please pay a deposit first, sir.

182
00:25:57,895 --> 00:25:58,418
I'm leaving my horse here...

183
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:59,755
and you think I'll run away?

184
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:01,622
Take care of my horse!

185
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:04,564
I will!

186
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:10,436
Take care, sir. Happy new year!

187
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:11,471
Let's go.

188
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:12,642
Take care, sir. Happy new year!

189
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:14,105
Waiter, it's a big inn;
nothing more than that.

190
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:15,243
Not even a slice of meat?

191
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,810
They've all gone home for new year,

192
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:18,276
so has the chef.

193
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:19,915
Let it be... any wine?

194
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:22,085
Sure... l'll take it now!

195
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,548
A bottle of best spring liquor!

196
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:28,149
Sir, it's just sold out!

197
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,084
She's taken all the rest.

198
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:33,620
Sir, please choose others.

199
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,661
Come here. Be my guest!

200
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:42,267
Please!

201
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,649
Thank you.

202
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:10,130
Waiter.

203
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:11,899
Waiter, one more bottle!

204
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,465
Waiter...

205
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:17,170
No need. Here.

206
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:47,134
I'll give this pair ofjade pendants
to who you love!

207
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:50,036
Don't be like that.

208
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:51,137
We always come back alive...

209
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:52,741
after each battle, don't we?

210
00:27:53,677 --> 00:27:54,609
Say it after I'm back.

211
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:56,377
Brother Yong.

212
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:00,782
Come on. Don't always cry!

213
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:04,216
Smile. You look much prettier
when you smile!

214
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:09,451
Come on... smile! I will be back!

215
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,956
Let's go!

216
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,167
We'll be back.

217
00:29:03,313 --> 00:29:04,143
How're you doing?

218
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:07,811
Where have you been the last two years?

219
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:09,411
You're here just to ask...

220
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,814
such dull questions?

221
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,828
I suspect if there's a demon in our house.

222
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:21,990
Three months ago,

223
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,327
When Brother Sheng was back
after encountering bandits in the desert,

224
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:29,539
he rescued a young woman
with nowhere to stay.

225
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:31,202
Elder sister.

226
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:33,341
Her names is Xiaowei.

227
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:37,878
She claimed to be daughter of Gao Kun,
a wealthy silk businessman.

228
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:42,474
Her parents were framed
and killed by corrupt officials

229
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:44,745
and she was sold to the bandits...

230
00:29:50,194 --> 00:29:50,990
Tell me.

231
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:53,891
So many people love Xiaowei.
Who will she go for?

232
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:56,593
How do I guess what's in a woman's heart?

233
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:03,134
Suddently,

234
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:05,800
there appeared an assassin in the city...

235
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:07,972
who tore out the hearts of so many.

236
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:10,380
Even the city's magistrate
ran away last night.

237
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,477
All the guards have hidden away.

238
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,774
No one dare patrol at night.

239
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:15,949
The new magistrate has not yet come.

240
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:18,144
But there can't be without law in the city.

241
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:21,218
Brothers,
we will now take charge of the city

242
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:23,052
till the new magistrate takes up his post.

243
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:24,251
Are you ready?

244
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,985
- The assassin keeps killing.
- Ready!

245
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:29,427
- Nobody can deal with it. - Go!

246
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:33,027
The only thing he can do is
step up the patrols every night.

247
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:35,838
Then some times later, people start to

248
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:39,673
doubt if they're all the work
of evil demons.

249
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:44,536
Miss, try this hairpin. It's beautiful.

250
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:46,575
These are the pearl powder.

251
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,648
New arrival.

252
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:48,818
Do you want to try it?

253
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:55,449
Miss, what you want is this, right?

254
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:56,751
Why should I buy this?

255
00:30:58,228 --> 00:30:59,525
You have to!

256
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,637
I'll take them all.

257
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:12,564
You gotta put on makeup!

258
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,141
Sure! I gotta put on makeup!

259
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:20,179
This way, please.

260
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:26,481
Is she really an evil demon?

261
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:28,690
I can't help you.

262
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,117
Let me find you a man of power!

263
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,819
Stay back. Back off...

264
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,999
The Taoist priest is dead,
with his heart digged out...

265
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,598
The killer is a big, tall guy.

266
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:42,205
I have told

267
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:45,435
no one but only you and another guy.

268
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:47,035
He is the Taoist priest.

269
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:50,343
He called me to take Xiaowei
to the Taoist temple

270
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:53,849
but he was dead the very next day!

271
00:31:55,152 --> 00:31:56,119
How horrible!

272
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:00,745
Okay!

273
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,723
I promise you to take Xiaowei to the temple.

274
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:05,757
Okay?

275
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:16,435
Sister Peirong.

276
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,902
I've got you a spell.

277
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:19,200
It expels demons and gives you peace.

278
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:23,808
She gives it to you. Just put it on.

279
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:25,043
Thank you.

280
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,516
Let's go.

281
00:32:36,026 --> 00:32:37,994
Xiaorou, hand me the medical kit!

282
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:39,127
Xiaowei is hurt!

283
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:42,261
Sister.

284
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:45,458
You didn't hurt me. See, I'm fine!

285
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:49,737
Lmpossible! I clearly saw her wound!

286
00:32:50,307 --> 00:32:51,239
What're you talking about?

287
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,069
She's not an evil demon, is she?

288
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,481
She's surely fun, and charming.

289
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:05,880
But how could she possibly be?

290
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:13,428
Only you can tempt me.

291
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:16,393
I've sent you so many letters.

292
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,692
Don't know if you got them.

293
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:20,767
What's up now?

294
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:22,737
Now, she's become...

295
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:26,736
more friendly with everyone,

296
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:30,678
and she's getting very close
to Brother Sheng.

297
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:32,348
Anyone knows you suspect she's a demon?

298
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,649
How dare I tell anyone else?

299
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:37,453
No one would believe me.

300
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,492
Demon?

301
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:49,996
You don't believe me, either?

302
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,360
I do, of course!

303
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:53,960
When did I ever disbelieve you?

304
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:02,739
What do you want me to do?

305
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:04,605
Find out the truth!

306
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:06,878
What if she's really not a demon?

307
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:09,244
Then I'll admit I'm wrong.

308
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:14,181
Please, Brother Yong!

309
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:17,291
Any money?

310
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:25,895
Find me if you don't have enough.

311
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:35,070
Lend me some money.

312
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:38,207
No money? But you invited me for a drink!

313
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:39,814
You enjoyed it too, didn't you?

314
00:34:48,392 --> 00:34:49,757
Hurry up!

315
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:51,755
Be careful.

316
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,228
Didn't I say you should wait for me?

317
00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:55,121
Miss Xiaowei said...

318
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:56,264
Master's irritated...

319
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,058
so we hurried to give the dishes.

320
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:01,800
Let me do it.

321
00:35:07,344 --> 00:35:08,003
Sister-in-law.

322
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:10,508
Sister-in-law.

323
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:11,878
Mistress.

324
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:21,789
Start the meal.

325
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,189
Start the meal.

326
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:32,229
Let me do it.

327
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,446
Where have you just been?

328
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:53,889
Everybody's waiting for you.

329
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:55,950
I've just...

330
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,719
Brother Wang, don't be upset with her.

331
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,389
Sister Peirong went to the beauty shop

332
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,930
for some lavender

333
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:07,261
to put under your pillow in a bag,

334
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:09,434
so you can sleep well.

335
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:13,601
It's New Year now.

336
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:17,671
Don't worry too much.

337
00:36:19,983 --> 00:36:20,813
I know.

338
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,008
Sister.

339
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:53,714
Are you looking for this?

340
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,718
I must thank you today.

341
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:08,495
I'll give it to Brother Sheng.

342
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,233
I know who you've been to see.

343
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:27,340
I won't tell Brother Wang.

344
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:37,652
Something is actually not what you think.

345
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,894
Anyway,

346
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:45,832
I'll tell you more about us later.

347
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:49,002
It's good as long as you're happy.

348
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,067
Have a rest.

349
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:49,558
I've made a box for you.

350
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:54,165
Put the hearts inside
and they'll be kept fresh.

351
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:55,727
Just put it there.

352
00:38:57,941 --> 00:39:00,239
Brother Sheng asked me to draw
the "heart-digger".

353
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:03,105
I must do it well.

354
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:10,945
Remember that old fella
surnamed Xia who chopped you?

355
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:13,549
Isn't he dead?

356
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:17,315
His granddaughter is here in town.

357
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:24,927
Damn it! Their family never let me go.

358
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:26,031
Shall I kill her for you?

359
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:27,497
Yes.

360
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:30,837
Don't smile.

361
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:33,540
No murderer smiles.

362
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:38,771
Don't move!

363
00:39:39,149 --> 00:39:40,582
You keep moving. How do I draw?

364
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,016
Brother Yong, you should know something

365
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:59,425
The dead bodies whose hearts...

366
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:00,830
are removed are all here.

367
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:04,538
Brother Sheng has run out of ideas,
so our Wang's Squadron...

368
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:06,140
can only patrol every night.

369
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:07,139
Wang's Squadron?

370
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:10,301
You've left for so long.

371
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,979
Should we still call it "Pang's Squadron"?

372
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:19,584
Wow!

373
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:22,285
This man is a real pro!

374
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:24,724
So accurate that he dug out the heart...

375
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:26,792
in a single cut!

376
00:40:27,664 --> 00:40:30,633
So I told Brother Sheng
this couldn't be done by a human.

377
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:32,964
You really believe in demons?

378
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,966
If I were a yin yang master,
I surely did...

379
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,934
A demon! A demon here!

380
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:40,833
Look at yourself. You believe in any crap!

381
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:42,705
What do you not believe? Yin yang master!

382
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:46,281
Also, I suspect one person.

383
00:40:46,716 --> 00:40:48,877
The woman Brother Sheng brought here -
Xiaowei.

384
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:51,813
Don't you love her?

385
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:52,680
Not for sure!

386
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:53,917
You suspect her?

387
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:56,548
The killing spree began once she arrived.

388
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:58,224
I really feel the evil "qi" from her!

389
00:40:58,428 --> 00:40:59,190
- With suspicious background...
- Alright...

390
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:01,489
Enough! You can set up a booth out there
and fool the guys!

391
00:41:01,698 --> 00:41:04,223
Get off! You feel good staying in a coffin?

392
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:05,497
Get off!

393
00:41:09,606 --> 00:41:10,630
What he say is correct!

394
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:13,241
All done by evil demons!

395
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:14,935
I too think evil demons did these.

396
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,579
Don't listen to her foolish talk!
It's all nonsense!

397
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:20,181
What foolish talk? I've seen before!

398
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,712
There're many demons in this world.

399
00:41:23,386 --> 00:41:25,013
Some're transformed from flowers,
grasses and trees...

400
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:27,212
some from tigers, wolves, snakes, foxes...

401
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:29,619
and some from love and hatred...

402
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:31,123
- Some are good, some are bad...
- Don't kid me!

403
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:32,885
Demons kill with a sword?

404
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:36,490
Why do humans kill humans for their hearts?

405
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,398
What's your name? You seem very sure.

406
00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:43,399
My name is Xia Bing.

407
00:41:44,474 --> 00:41:45,566
I'm a "Demon Buster".

408
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:47,307
My name is Pang Yong.

409
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:48,936
I don't believe in demons.

410
00:41:52,816 --> 00:41:54,340
This sealed part of fox tail...

411
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:56,519
will direct us to the
"Beautiful Fox from the Sky".

412
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:58,978
Once it senses a fox
spirit in the vicinity,

413
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,913
it glares.

414
00:42:01,558 --> 00:42:03,685
This is what brought me here.

415
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:06,793
I'm sure the demon is still in this city.

416
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:09,031
Can you sense where the demon is?

417
00:42:10,934 --> 00:42:12,231
Within a ten-mile radius of here.

418
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:16,166
The entire city
is only some ten miles long.

419
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:20,805
Such a big range!

420
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:22,366
This is the last place!

421
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:24,202
I've spent all my money on the case.

422
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:26,378
The Taoist priest died right here!

423
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:28,149
Also,

424
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:31,379
all the murders occurred
on the east side of the city.

425
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:32,416
Look.

426
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:38,319
Not only that.
They all surrounded commander's house!

427
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:39,426
Exactly!

428
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:41,023
So what do we do next?

429
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:42,095
Nothing to do with you.

430
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,392
Miss, this is the official matter.

431
00:42:45,602 --> 00:42:46,660
I think you needn't ask.

432
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:48,836
He doesn't work for the government, either!

433
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,372
Nothing to do with you as well.

434
00:42:55,812 --> 00:42:57,404
Hey, where're you going?

435
00:42:59,649 --> 00:43:00,513
Nothing to do with you!

436
00:43:01,518 --> 00:43:03,577
Hey...

437
00:43:04,921 --> 00:43:06,115
I've used up my money!

438
00:43:42,492 --> 00:43:43,356
Are you okay?

439
00:43:47,096 --> 00:43:47,960
You're that demon?

440
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:49,365
Don't fool around!

441
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:52,093
You wanna run?

442
00:44:05,448 --> 00:44:06,176
You so over there.

443
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:10,084
Leave me alone! Get him!

444
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:31,597
Waiter! Waiter!

445
00:45:33,102 --> 00:45:37,061
Stop shouting. It's new year's day.
Everybody's gone.

446
00:45:55,525 --> 00:45:58,517
Do you come to drink or heal me?

447
00:45:58,728 --> 00:46:01,253
Don't panic. Just a small wound.

448
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:05,258
What're you doing?

449
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:09,970
Why didn't you tell me you'd blow?

450
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,465
I had wine in my mouth.
I couldn't tell you.

451
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:16,008
Have you seen enough?

452
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:16,970
Don't move.

453
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:20,243
What?

454
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:23,519
What... you...

455
00:46:25,922 --> 00:46:27,446
Softly... softly...

456
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:29,083
Be quiet.

457
00:46:30,927 --> 00:46:31,791
It's done by a sword!

458
00:46:32,895 --> 00:46:34,453
Can a demon use a sword?

459
00:46:34,697 --> 00:46:35,755
Who say they can't?

460
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,494
Softly, softy...

461
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:41,361
How do you deal with them?

462
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,607
Ordinary demons can be finished by
a single slash.

463
00:46:47,944 --> 00:46:49,172
What if they're not ordinary?

464
00:46:57,987 --> 00:46:59,079
This is this "Demon Rod".

465
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:01,583
My grandpa told me that...

466
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,085
its power is beyond limit...

467
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:06,317
when it meets a capable person.

468
00:47:07,196 --> 00:47:08,754
That person is surely not you!

469
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:12,462
I can't take it out.

470
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:37,915
Not me, either.

471
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:43,764
I think your grandpa also couldn't.

472
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:45,627
Sure! How do you know?

473
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:50,398
You don't believe my words?

474
00:47:52,475 --> 00:47:55,444
Yes, yes. I dare not disbelieve!

475
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:11,191
Don't get caught.

476
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:15,856
I must've killed the gal...

477
00:48:16,165 --> 00:48:17,689
if it weren't for that drunk.

478
00:48:20,236 --> 00:48:22,830
So she was really helped from her old lover.

479
00:48:30,513 --> 00:48:32,413
Put Master's clothes in!

480
00:48:34,217 --> 00:48:35,707
No wonder she's getting bold!

481
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:38,148
The sun is great. Dry it in the sun!

482
00:48:38,421 --> 00:48:42,380
Miss Xiaowei, who's getting bold?

483
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:45,219
I didn't say anything.

484
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:49,696
I'm sorry.

485
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:51,798
I can't go to the beauty store with you...

486
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:53,865
coz mistress needs my help.

487
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,867
Doesn't matter. You do your things.

488
00:48:56,072 --> 00:48:57,061
I can go myself.

489
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:04,740
Where did you go?

490
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,212
I... I just helped in the study...

491
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,812
You go to the kitchen, then.

492
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:12,646
Yes!

493
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:14,349
Brother Yong, I've checked it.

494
00:49:14,624 --> 00:49:16,649
There's a rich man called Gao Kun
in another city.

495
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:18,850
The whole family died of a plague
three years ago.

496
00:49:19,095 --> 00:49:21,188
He doesn't have a daughter.
This woman's lying.

497
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,059
Peirong, where's Xiaowei?

498
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:27,236
In the beauty shop.

499
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:29,927
Brother Yong, what do you find her for?

500
00:49:30,606 --> 00:49:31,732
She's not what she claims to be!

501
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,308
You've brought a demon home!

502
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:35,508
Demon?

503
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:40,181
Brother Yong,
you do believe a rumor like this?

504
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,349
I just want to find out the truth.

505
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:44,649
Truth. Fine.

506
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:47,350
I'll get you there and see the truth.

507
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:57,764
The Gao family has no daughter!
Who are you?

508
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:01,064
Xiahou Xiang is known to be wrong
all the time!

509
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:02,564
Has he misunderstood you?

510
00:50:02,872 --> 00:50:05,170
That's right! Miss Xiaowei, just go ahead

511
00:50:05,374 --> 00:50:06,306
tell us your difficulties!

512
00:50:06,976 --> 00:50:09,103
Xiaowei, don't be scared.

513
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:10,436
Tell us everything!

514
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:20,916
I'm actually not the Gao family's daughter.

515
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:23,486
I'm only...

516
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:26,656
their maid.

517
00:50:28,965 --> 00:50:31,092
But I love being with you...

518
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,858
and don't want you to look down upon me.

519
00:50:33,502 --> 00:50:36,266
That's why I made up such that stupid story.

520
00:50:37,273 --> 00:50:38,865
Who else can verify what you said?

521
00:50:41,344 --> 00:50:42,333
No.

522
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:44,575
We can!

523
00:50:44,947 --> 00:50:45,470
We rescued her...

524
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:47,080
from the lair of the desert's bandits.

525
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:49,615
She'd have died if we it weren't for us!

526
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:51,787
- Yes! Yes...
- Sure! We rescued her...

527
00:50:51,988 --> 00:50:52,886
Brother Wang,

528
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:54,984
I did tell lies.

529
00:50:55,858 --> 00:50:57,951
But please don't banish me! Will you?

530
00:50:58,294 --> 00:50:59,659
I don't want to be alone.

531
00:51:02,064 --> 00:51:02,860
Get up.

532
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:06,464
With me here, nobody dare bully you.

533
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,608
I'll chop your hands off and see
if you're a demon!

534
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:14,906
Brother Yong!

535
00:51:16,545 --> 00:51:18,172
What're you doing? Are you crazy?

536
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:20,278
I just tested her.
It's the back of the blade!

537
00:51:22,885 --> 00:51:25,445
I don't care what tricks you played.
Xiaowei is my family!

538
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:28,814
Your family... so what about Peirong?

539
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:32,624
Peirong is your wife!
She's been worried about you every day!

540
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:35,828
Brother Yong.

541
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:40,358
You still care that Peirong had chosen me!

542
00:51:40,736 --> 00:51:41,464
Bastard!

543
00:51:43,172 --> 00:51:44,161
I'm not happy!

544
00:51:45,174 --> 00:51:46,698
Coz Peirong has chosen the wrong one!

545
00:51:46,976 --> 00:51:48,409
You cold-hearted thing!

546
00:51:49,178 --> 00:51:50,668
They're already married.

547
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,313
I think you'd better give up.

548
00:51:52,515 --> 00:51:53,345
Shut up!

549
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:56,014
Obsessed by that woman!

550
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:57,549
You've never seen a woman?

551
00:51:57,753 --> 00:51:58,651
Pang Yong!

552
00:51:59,555 --> 00:52:02,388
It's my private matter. It's none of yours!

553
00:52:02,591 --> 00:52:04,024
I must care about the demon's case!

554
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:11,425
This is a section of tail from a fox spirit.

555
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:16,330
Whenever a demon shows up, it glares.

556
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:29,514
It's always glaring. So we're all demons?

557
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:34,113
I'm a "Demon Buster".
Everything I said is real!

558
00:52:34,857 --> 00:52:36,825
I don't believe it. Who does?

559
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,326
The ghosts do!

560
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,928
I do!

561
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:46,700
I saw it with my own eyes!

562
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:48,725
She knows black magic.

563
00:52:50,673 --> 00:52:52,004
I hurt her hand by accident

564
00:52:53,709 --> 00:52:55,336
and it healed up at once.

565
00:52:57,346 --> 00:53:02,113
Later I told this to the Taoist priest.

566
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,553
He said you're a demon with high power.

567
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:12,826
On the very next day, he died...

568
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:22,202
I've been staying with you.
I know more than anyone else.

569
00:53:25,274 --> 00:53:26,138
I have an idea!

570
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:31,543
There's a "mark" on each demon,

571
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,868
Like human's birthmark.

572
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:38,846
Dare you let us examine you?

573
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:43,580
Miss Demon, are you scared?

574
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,682
Dare you?

575
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,426
I dare!

576
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,564
I do as long as you won't suspect me.

577
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:49,814
Satisfied?

578
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,022
Nothing to do with her.
They're all my ideas.

579
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,360
I still have one more idea.

580
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:05,626
Are you finished?

581
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:09,872
For a fox spirit
to sustain their human form,

582
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,438
they must swallow human hearts,

583
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:14,442
which is why there're so many deaths
with their hearts removed.

584
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,805
Are you finished?

585
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,346
- Sure...
- Are you wasting our time?

586
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:21,752
What you mean is...

587
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,510
If she has no heart to eat,

588
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:25,815
she'll reveal her true form?

589
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,426
Let's watch Miss Xiaowei for a while!

590
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:40,030
See if she'll become a demon
with no hearts to eat.

591
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:46,467
I must let you know that you're wrong!

592
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:52,010
I'm not so stupid
to keep a demon in my house!

593
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,452
Don't make any mistakes.

594
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,318
Even you don't believe me?

595
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,756
I do.

596
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:11,733
Get in.

597
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:15,260
I understand that

598
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,641
you're just concerned about me.

599
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,571
I'm sorry.

600
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,779
You should apologize so Xiaowei.

601
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:57,774
I'm so sorry...

602
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,484
I'm sorry for you, sister.

603
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,989
I know why you suspect that I'm a demon.

604
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,483
You worry if I'll steal Brother Wang.

605
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:16,992
Yes, I really love him.

606
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,840
But don't get me wrong.
I'll never oppose you.

607
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,308
Please accept me as his concubine...

608
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,421
Please...

609
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:56,536
Xiaowei, just get up.

610
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,710
Sister Peirong, I beg you...

611
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,243
Xiaowei.

612
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,321
There is only one Mrs. Wang.

613
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,128
You should be so tired today.

614
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:29,837
Xiaorou.

615
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:30,900
Yes!

616
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,466
Take Xiaowei back to her room.

617
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:36,377
Miss Xiaowei...

618
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:45,551
Stick with her!
Even when she's in the toilet!

619
00:58:58,102 --> 00:58:59,194
Mrs. Wang.

620
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:12,240
There is only one Mrs. Wang.

621
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,637
Please get some rest, Miss Xiaowei.

622
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:46,483
Okay.

623
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:02,183
I have some good dim sum. You like it?

624
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:03,391
No, thanks!

625
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:06,354
You might try to poison me!

626
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,859
Do you still suspect me?

627
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,165
I never suspected you.

628
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:17,833
I am sure you are!

629
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,071
General! General!

630
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,144
The heart digger has done it again!

631
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:14,828
Xiaorou, you help me with it.

632
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,262
Let Miss Xiaowei have some rest.

633
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,066
Come on.

634
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,511
Brother Yong.

635
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:37,617
The guy killed some more people
in a couple of days.

636
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:40,415
Our soldiers're placed everywhere, but...

637
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,885
we still can't catch him.

638
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,951
You can't catch him. He's a demon!

639
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,627
Demon?

640
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,502
Don't you mean Xiaowei's a demon?

641
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,237
You've been watching her all day.

642
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:56,906
Why still deaths outside?

643
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:02,735
Who says there's only one demon?

644
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,541
Another one?

645
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:09,711
Wang Sheng, what do you think?

646
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:17,086
I think he should be a kung fu expert.

647
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,190
Only you can seize him.

648
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,897
I sincerely hope you to stay.

649
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:25,193
I, Peirong,

650
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:28,070
and all the citizens here will thank you.

651
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:31,630
Please.

652
01:03:34,845 --> 01:03:35,675
Peirong.

653
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:40,313
You persuade Brother Yong.

654
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,355
I'm sorry.

655
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:51,126
Don't say sorry.
I don't want you to say sorry.

656
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:52,656
You've done nothing wrong.

657
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:56,831
I'm back...

658
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,695
only to see that you're happy.

659
01:03:58,902 --> 01:03:59,891
You look good, aren't you?

660
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:02,970
Brother Yong.

661
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:05,568
You're the best man ever.

662
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:08,934
Hope you'll find a woman better than me.

663
01:04:09,947 --> 01:04:11,141
Don't worry.

664
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,441
I've been traveling around alone very well.

665
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,811
So free. And nothing to be anxious.

666
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,684
Let's talk later.
I'll go help Wang Sheng now.

667
01:04:21,592 --> 01:04:22,524
Stupid man!

668
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:30,465
Miss Xia Bing, he's a good man.

669
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,369
Do treat him better.

670
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:40,632
Don't lump me with him!
It's not what you think.

671
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,579
I'm not interested in such a stupid shit.

672
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:24,715
Put on our golden armors
and we're forever the strongest.

673
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:32,252
Sacrifice our lives
for the sake of our parents.

674
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:36,521
Spill our blood...

675
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:07,895
Xiahou Xiang!

676
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:14,160
This time, I get plotted...

677
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,212
Mistress! Mistress!

678
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,748
Mistress...

679
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,089
Mistress...

680
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:36,350
My God! It's heard that Pang Yong
killed Xiahou Xiang!

681
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,690
Lmpossible!

682
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,621
The Mo Zhui guys personally saw it.

683
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:07,481
Xiaohou Xiang is dead.

684
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,026
I know.

685
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:15,057
They suspect that I killed him.

686
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:18,490
I know it as well.

687
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:22,362
I don't believe, though.

688
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:26,067
Under such circumstances,

689
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:29,101
you'll suffer if you follow me.

690
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,039
Who follows you?

691
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:36,643
Now you're following me to catch the demon!

692
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:41,618
Catch it? Are you confident?

693
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:45,888
No, for sure!

694
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,195
When had I ever been confident?

695
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:53,599
But why're you still after him?

696
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:54,995
You're not scared of death?

697
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,407
I'm a Demon Buster.

698
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:06,246
It's my duty.

699
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,158
Life gets better if you have a purpose.

700
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,398
You're right!

701
01:08:24,568 --> 01:08:25,592
And you?

702
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,498
What's your purpose?

703
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,374
Seems that it's the same as yours now.

704
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:45,747
His horse is still here.
He must still be in the city.

705
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:47,046
You bring a team there.

706
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:48,383
- Yes! - Let's go!

707
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:50,253
- Go! - Take care, general!

708
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,105
Get some sleep.

709
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,507
I'll go nowhere tonight.
I'll stay with you.

710
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:27,196
Don't worry.

711
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:31,164
I don't believe Brother Yong'd
kill Xiahou Xiang, either.

712
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:35,670
I'll find him and ask him thoroughly.

713
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,149
I want to ask you,

714
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:57,417
will you love her...

715
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,788
if Xiaowei is not a demon?

716
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,494
How can Xiaowei be a demon?

717
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:27,345
Okay... I promise.

718
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,824
I'll get more Taoist priests
to check her out,

719
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:32,454
okay?

720
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:34,621
Okay?

721
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,065
You haven't answered me yet.

722
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,035
Will you love her?

723
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,482
Whether she's a demon or woman,

724
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:06,355
I won't.

725
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:10,191
Rest assured.

726
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:02,535
What's up?

727
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,901
Brother Wang.

728
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:11,514
I think I need to go.

729
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,147
I've said too many that I shouldn't have.

730
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:19,655
You forgot it?

731
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,353
I said I'll look after you,

732
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:23,821
like my sister.

733
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,557
Peirong will understand!

734
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,668
Am I really that... useless?

735
01:14:35,405 --> 01:14:36,394
How could you be?

736
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:41,877
Everyone can see that Gao Xiang,

737
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:43,773
Jing Ping and Jing An are attracted to you.

738
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:46,908
I think that nobody'll ever dislike you

739
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:50,182
in this whole world.

740
01:14:52,522 --> 01:14:54,422
But I only want you to love me.

741
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:05,195
Can I not even become your concubine?

742
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:15,839
It's me who's not qualified.

743
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:20,782
Don't sell yourself short.
You shouldn't be my concubine.

744
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:22,812
You should find a good man...

745
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:27,384
who takes care of you and loves you.

746
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:28,889
Right?

747
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,467
Have you ever loved me?

748
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:05,617
I don't need anyone else.

749
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:09,356
I don't need any status.

750
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,959
I just want to be your woman,

751
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:16,165
even ifjust once...

752
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:45,591
Are you okay?

753
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:04,575
Alright.

754
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,442
You needn't worry if Xiaowei's a demon.
Okay?

755
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:09,547
What's wrong?

756
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,385
Why were you staying in her room?

757
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:19,384
I...

758
01:18:19,595 --> 01:18:21,028
- I just... - Don't need to say it.

759
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,731
I know she really loves you.

760
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:30,970
And I understand...

761
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:33,234
It's not what you think...

762
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:35,235
It's all my fault.

763
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:40,081
As a wife, I was jealous, maybe.

764
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:44,379
If you love her too,

765
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,023
then make her your concubine.

766
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,282
I don't!

767
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:03,572
Let me finish my words.

768
01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:15,079
As her elder sister,
I'll decide it for her.

769
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,224
It's you...

770
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,021
who still don't believe I can do it.

771
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,029
General!

772
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,157
Who let you come out?

773
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:09,466
Don't forget you're a demon.

774
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,135
Don't shed a tear for a man.

775
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:14,736
Now you're more stupid
than that stupid woman!

776
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:17,511
You know I love him?

777
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:21,142
Do you know what's love,

778
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:23,014
you fly eater?

779
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:25,785
I know!

780
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,020
And I've told you, I love you.

781
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:32,524
But I don't love you!

782
01:20:34,764 --> 01:20:38,131
I told you long ago.
You've been shameless enough to stay!

783
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:46,465
Who gets you all those hearts without me?

784
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:48,904
I'll live well without you!

785
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,312
Now act like a man and leave.

786
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:54,047
Get away!

787
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:05,259
Okay.

788
01:21:07,597 --> 01:21:08,689
I'm sorry for what I've done.

789
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:12,958
I'll never disturb you!

790
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:17,271
Go!

791
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:02,582
- Mistress... - Mistress...

792
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:21,293
Sister Peirong, still staying up?

793
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:22,666
Sister Xiaowei.

794
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,330
I think there's one thing...

795
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,369
I must talk with you.

796
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:49,831
You find me... for something?

797
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:08,980
Now you know it all.

798
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:16,156
Didn't you say I'm a demon?
What do you fear?

799
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:26,364
Go tell everyone.
Those who know must die, after all.

800
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:39,878
Brother Gao, let's take a look outside.

801
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:40,673
Be careful.

802
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:41,907
- Okay. - Go!

803
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:45,318
Mistress! Are you all right?

804
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,052
I'm fine.

805
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,464
What do you want?

806
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,770
Not made up my mind yet.

807
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:12,143
Brother Gao.

808
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:14,074
Miss Xiaowei...

809
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:15,113
Don't come in!

810
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:20,421
Brother Gao,
Sister Peirong said she saw a demon.

811
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:23,317
Demon? Where is it?

812
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:25,555
Right here!

813
01:24:28,264 --> 01:24:28,992
No!

814
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:37,896
Didn't you say you like me?

815
01:24:38,474 --> 01:24:39,941
Can you give me your heart?

816
01:24:54,957 --> 01:24:56,822
Seen any demons eating a human heart?

817
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:20,414
Brother Sheng loves you. Don't hurt him!

818
01:25:25,321 --> 01:25:29,052
It's useless as long as you,
Mrs. Wang, is here.

819
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:31,817
That's nothing!

820
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,260
I can let you be Mrs. Wang.

821
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:37,760
Me?

822
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:42,767
Can you guarantee that
you'll never come back?

823
01:25:44,773 --> 01:25:47,105
I've seen you eat a human heart.

824
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,201
Can I still stay alive?

825
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,042
Go ahead kill me!

826
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,486
You think I'm that stupid?

827
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:07,823
If I kill you,

828
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:12,793
Brother Wang'd miss you forever.

829
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,323
Drink this up.

830
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:41,190
Go admit to be a demon killing
all those guys.

831
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:47,392
I'll be Mrs. Wang and you the demon.

832
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,180
I can.

833
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:03,081
But will you promise not to kill again?

834
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:09,622
I'm a demon. I'll grow old if I don't.

835
01:27:21,604 --> 01:27:23,834
Okay, I promise you.

836
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,332
When I become Mrs. Wang,

837
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,377
I'll stay with him,
grow old and die with him.

838
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:44,156
You really love him?

839
01:27:45,227 --> 01:27:46,626
Yes, I do.

840
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,278
Do keep your words.

841
01:28:14,023 --> 01:28:17,515
If you regret, I'll kill everyone.

842
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:25,528
You don't even know what is love.

843
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:43,885
A demon...

844
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,512
Xiaorou! Xiaorou...

845
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,915
Help! Help...

846
01:28:54,296 --> 01:28:55,957
Mistress...

847
01:28:56,298 --> 01:28:57,265
What's happening?

848
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:11,879
Hey! Stop!

849
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:43,533
Mistress, why is it you?

850
01:29:43,746 --> 01:29:46,943
I'm the demon. Go ahead kill me.

851
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:55,753
You all stop moving!

852
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,155
Back off!

853
01:29:57,359 --> 01:29:58,485
Or I'll kill you!

854
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:19,004
Peirong, stand it! You'll be fine!

855
01:30:27,389 --> 01:30:30,051
Master! Mistress is really the demon!

856
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,851
Xiaorou, don't talk anything nonsense.

857
01:30:33,362 --> 01:30:37,264
Has Sister Peirong...
suffered from any strange disease?

858
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:39,633
Not her? So who killed Brother Gao?

859
01:30:39,835 --> 01:30:40,631
Sure!

860
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:42,133
We must revenge Brother Gao!

861
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,715
She seems to have suffered
from evil poison.

862
01:30:58,887 --> 01:31:01,048
It's graded by color.

863
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:04,615
The lighter the color,
the more deadly it is.

864
01:31:05,561 --> 01:31:09,657
White is therefore
the most poisonous of all.

865
01:31:10,566 --> 01:31:14,297
When the whole body turns white,
one must die.

866
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:18,399
Do you have so many ways?
How to save her?

867
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:30,017
You've woken up, Peirong. Feeling better?

868
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:32,611
You all leave me.

869
01:31:34,022 --> 01:31:35,080
Did Xiaowei do this?

870
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,649
I myself...

871
01:31:40,562 --> 01:31:41,893
is the demon.

872
01:31:42,097 --> 01:31:43,086
Don't speak nonsense!

873
01:31:44,099 --> 01:31:45,930
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

874
01:31:46,869 --> 01:31:49,235
She's a Demon Buster.
She must be able to help.

875
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:51,398
Don't you have your family's treasure?

876
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:55,641
Sure. My grandpa left me a lot.

877
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,812
I...

878
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,369
Not these.

879
01:32:00,382 --> 01:32:00,848
Your grandpa...

880
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:02,482
he gave me that one treasure.

881
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:03,910
Sure...

882
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:07,854
Look! She really has the treasure!

883
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:08,954
It can destroy the demons!

884
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,513
Come to think of it.

885
01:32:10,759 --> 01:32:12,750
My grandpa told me,
once the demon is killed...

886
01:32:12,961 --> 01:32:15,896
the dark magic cast on human body
should vanish...

887
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:17,229
Can you hear it?

888
01:32:17,499 --> 01:32:18,261
Yes!

889
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:22,695
You'd have used it if it was really useful.

890
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,471
You cannot beat her.

891
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:30,977
Don't worry.

892
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:36,475
The killings should end with me.

893
01:32:40,255 --> 01:32:44,248
Stop speaking nonsense.
I will have the way.

894
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:00,370
Peirong!

895
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:01,503
Peirong!

896
01:33:04,313 --> 01:33:05,837
Peirong, I've taken back my sword!

897
01:33:06,548 --> 01:33:08,106
You know how powerful it is?

898
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:10,610
With it, I never lost!

899
01:33:10,852 --> 01:33:12,444
You'll be saved once I kill the demon!

900
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,147
I'll chop her into pieces! Okay?

901
01:33:30,706 --> 01:33:31,468
I'll ask you one more time.

902
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:34,165
You're sure it's Xiaowei?

903
01:33:34,376 --> 01:33:35,468
I don't want any innocent deaths!

904
01:33:38,347 --> 01:33:39,473
You still don't believe me now?

905
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:40,705
Okay, I'm going.

906
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:42,078
You take care of Peirong!

907
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:44,947
You're really going?

908
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:45,881
I must go for sure.

909
01:33:46,088 --> 01:33:48,056
You can't! You cannot kill her!

910
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,622
Don't kid me!

911
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:51,554
Your grandpa cut off the fox spirit's tail.

912
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:52,954
This sword's great.

913
01:33:53,195 --> 01:33:54,389
How could I not kill her?

914
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:57,296
My grandpa cut her using his own blood!

915
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:01,493
We, the "Demon Busters",

916
01:34:01,703 --> 01:34:03,364
have bloods

917
01:34:04,006 --> 01:34:05,473
which can specially kill demons.

918
01:34:07,075 --> 01:34:08,440
If you do want to kill Xiaowei,

919
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:11,036
bring me there.

920
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:49,878
Wang Sheng,

921
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:52,747
do you know what's happening?

922
01:35:14,476 --> 01:35:16,273
Miss, don't get there!

923
01:35:21,683 --> 01:35:23,048
Are you really a demon?

924
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:39,265
Yes.

925
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:46,973
You killed Gao Xiang?

926
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,723
I killed everyone.

927
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:04,414
We must revenge Brother Gao!

928
01:36:06,061 --> 01:36:07,323
You want to kill her, kill me first.

929
01:36:07,996 --> 01:36:08,928
Revenge Brother Gao!

930
01:36:09,164 --> 01:36:10,131
An eye for an eye!

931
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:14,268
Revenge Brother Gao!

932
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:15,458
Shut up!

933
01:36:17,606 --> 01:36:19,597
She's a demon. I must kill her!

934
01:36:31,052 --> 01:36:36,957
But how can I give her up as a husband?

935
01:36:42,531 --> 01:36:43,327
Put down the knife!

936
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:46,425
Put it down!

937
01:36:47,068 --> 01:36:48,126
Put down the knife first!

938
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:49,200
Peirong

939
01:36:49,538 --> 01:36:54,134
I must take
all the responsibility with you!

940
01:36:55,343 --> 01:36:56,241
I'm a demon.

941
01:36:57,445 --> 01:37:00,073
I killed so many and I deserve it.

942
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:02,449
You're my wife.

943
01:37:05,554 --> 01:37:10,890
Whether you're demon or woman, I love you.

944
01:37:12,928 --> 01:37:14,020
I love you forever!

945
01:37:18,867 --> 01:37:19,595
No.

946
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:33,607
Promise me.

947
01:37:34,983 --> 01:37:37,076
Live well.

948
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:40,245
Live on for me...

949
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:04,807
Evil woman!

950
01:38:12,187 --> 01:38:16,556
You all see it? She is the real demon!

951
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:21,022
You all see it? She is the real demon!

952
01:38:44,152 --> 01:38:45,176
What? Leave me!

953
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:47,555
You can't kill her!

954
01:38:48,623 --> 01:38:49,248
What're you doing?

955
01:38:50,725 --> 01:38:51,350
Go!

956
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:16,937
Give her back to me.

957
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,244
If you love me,

958
01:40:25,153 --> 01:40:26,814
give Peirong back to me.

959
01:40:29,124 --> 01:40:30,955
If you love her so much,

960
01:40:32,794 --> 01:40:35,592
why don't you die with her?

961
01:40:36,297 --> 01:40:37,321
I'll die.

962
01:40:40,735 --> 01:40:42,362
Get her here!

963
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,039
Will you believe her?

964
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,467
If Peirong dies,

965
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:51,642
I'll die with her.

966
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:56,780
If she comes back to life,

967
01:41:00,255 --> 01:41:01,847
Tell her that...

968
01:41:04,626 --> 01:41:06,253
I haven't been a good husband.

969
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,859
I've failed to protect her.

970
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:15,399
I love you,

971
01:41:19,507 --> 01:41:21,566
but I'm married with Peirong.

972
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:23,941
No!

973
01:41:25,146 --> 01:41:26,704
Brother Sheng!

974
01:41:48,336 --> 01:41:49,325
What's this?

975
01:42:02,517 --> 01:42:04,951
You saved them
with the thousand-year spirit!

976
01:42:06,554 --> 01:42:07,521
You're a demon.

977
01:42:08,223 --> 01:42:08,848
They won't let you go even...

978
01:42:09,057 --> 01:42:10,354
if you saved them!

979
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:13,450
How can a demon gets ture love
in the world?

980
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:20,800
I'll get you out of here...

981
01:42:22,237 --> 01:42:23,226
once I kill them all!

982
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:43,448
Look! He has a shadow!

983
01:45:11,873 --> 01:45:12,464
Take it!

984
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:43,230
Hurry up! Kill him!

985
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:52,578
Do it! Just do it...

986
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:55,574
It doesn't matter if I die.
You must kill him!

987
01:45:56,017 --> 01:45:58,611
Take Peirong's spirit back and save her.

988
01:45:59,153 --> 01:46:01,519
Kill me. Do it quickly!

989
01:46:02,123 --> 01:46:03,522
Do it...!

990
01:46:25,346 --> 01:46:29,715
Xiaowei!

991
01:47:57,839 --> 01:47:59,830
Many hatreds in the world...

992
01:48:01,509 --> 01:48:03,909
can be finished without killing.

993
01:48:07,515 --> 01:48:08,846
I now realize why...

994
01:48:11,686 --> 01:48:13,278
I couldn't exert all my energy...

995
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,011
of a Demon Buster.

996
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:20,586
It's because I've been bearing hatred.

997
01:48:28,302 --> 01:48:29,599
Go ahead save them.

998
01:50:41,869 --> 01:50:43,302
General, general...

999
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,170
Are you okay, general?

1000
01:50:49,043 --> 01:50:50,408
Master, are you okay?

1001
01:50:51,345 --> 01:50:52,107
- Brother Dabao, are you okay?
- Mistress...

1002
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:53,940
- General, are you fine?
- Brother Dabao...

1003
01:50:54,148 --> 01:50:55,615
Mistress, it's fine now.

1004
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:17,429
- Brother Yong! - Brother Yong!

1005
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:19,271
Brother Yong!

1006
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:20,439
- Brother Yong! - Brother Yong!

1007
01:51:20,641 --> 01:51:21,505
What's wrong with you? Brother Yong!

1008
01:51:21,709 --> 01:51:22,903
Wake up... Brother Yong!

1009
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:24,270
- Brother Yong! - Wake up...

1010
01:51:24,512 --> 01:51:27,709
Brother Yong! Wake up...

1011
01:51:28,582 --> 01:51:30,709
Brother Yong...

1012
01:51:30,918 --> 01:51:34,854
Don't shake me anymore or I'm surely dying!

1013
01:51:35,056 --> 01:51:36,717
I'm so tired after the long fight.

1014
01:51:59,213 --> 01:52:00,145
You're sure you don't want to stay?

1015
01:52:04,852 --> 01:52:06,217
There're still many places I want to go.

1016
01:52:09,323 --> 01:52:10,347
Me too.

1017
01:52:21,268 --> 01:52:22,098
I'm leaving.

1018
01:53:04,545 --> 01:53:05,443
Take care!

1019
01:53:13,721 --> 01:53:14,551
Where're you going?

1020
01:53:16,257 --> 01:53:18,225
The world's so big.
I can go wherever I want.

1021
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,253
You seem to have a gift
for catching demons.

1022
01:53:20,928 --> 01:53:21,690
Hey

1023
01:53:23,063 --> 01:53:24,792
Wanna catch demons with me?

1024
01:53:54,628 --> 01:53:55,925
Why don't you call me master?

1025
01:53:56,764 --> 01:53:58,163
You're not qualified...

1026
01:53:58,365 --> 01:53:59,354
with all those mediocre skills.

1027
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:02,131
I'm more experienced than you.

1028
01:54:05,206 --> 01:54:05,934
What're you looking at?

1029
01:54:07,308 --> 01:54:09,640
Put off your cap
and you look very much like a woman.

1030
01:54:12,546 --> 01:54:13,342
Not bad, not bad!
