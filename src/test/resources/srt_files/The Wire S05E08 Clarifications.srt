1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,200
- And, uh, as you can see
from the locations,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,500
the killer is working
primarily in the southern,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,900
central and southeastern,
which makes sense

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,600
given the concentrations
of homeless in those districts.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,200
Vics one and three
were killed at night,

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,600
two and four
had daylight T.O.D.s.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,500
- Detective, what about
the missing man, Mr. Butler?

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Is there any lead at all
on his whereabouts?

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,100
- No, sir. We, uh--

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,400
We have teletypes with every
police agency in the mid-Atlantic,

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,100
we're also running
daily morgue checks

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,700
in ten states
and the district,

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,400
but uh-- nothing yet.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,800
- Where are we on a profile?

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,100
- I've arranged for our people
to travel to Quantico today.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
The bureau's been
very accommodating.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
- I mean,
this is a strange one.

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,000
I've heard of people
going after street people,

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,000
but it's usually
adolescent sadism.

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,200
This sexual thing--

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,200
It is different.

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,500
We put it out on VICAP,

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,400
and we have no hits anywhere
else in the country.

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
- I mean, I'm all for a little
kinky shit now and then,

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,700
but chewing on a homeless fella?

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,200
- You seem to be well grounded
in the case file, detective.

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
What else do you need?

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,600
- Well, we've developed a rough
list of those adult males

29
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,000
who were briefly detained
by police near pier five

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,900
soon after the suspect
made his last call.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance.

32
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,300
They're not suspects,

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,500
but we wld consider them
persons of interest.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
We've also developed
a rough list

35
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,100
of known adult white homosexual sex
offenders in these three districts.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,500
And, as we cull that list,
we would--

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance, too.

38
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,800
About a dozen men.

39
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,300
Less, actually.

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
We should be able to eliminate
many of our potentials

41
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,600
through retroactive
investigation.

42
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,100
Do you have your people?

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
- I've asked the chief of patrol
to detail sergeant Ellis Carver

44
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
from the western homicide

45
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,000
for purposes of running
the surveillance element.

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,300
- Why not a man
from one of the districts

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,700
where the attacks occurred?

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,000
- Well, I've worked with Carver

49
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,600
on prolonged investigations
in the past,

50
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,000
and his familiary with
surveillance tactics is relevant.

51
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,000
Also, I would be inclined to
trust his objective assessment

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,000
when choosing surveillance teams.

53
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,200
Very good.

54
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,400
If that works for patrol,
it works for operations.

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
- What are we doing
to protect people?

56
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,400
- Patrol and tactical
are running extra cars

57
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,900
in all three districts
with special emphasis on posts

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
where the homeless congregate.

59
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,400
We have ten undercovers,
dressed as vagrants,

60
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,600
working staggered shifts.

61
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,800
- We're going to need
good undercover cars as well.

62
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,300
And I'm told that motor pool
expects nothing back

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,700
from Dickman Street until--

64
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,100
- Whatever you need, detective.

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
- Yes, Mr. Mayor, but we're
being told by public works--

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,700
- Go to Avis
if you have to, Hertz.

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
I don't give a shit.
People are disappearing.

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,100
They're dying, for crissake.

69
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,000
Just do what you need to do.

70
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,700
The bad news, gentlemen,

71
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,000
is we're actually going to have
to catch this motherfucker.

72
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,000
The good news is that our mayor
finally needs a police department

73
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,700
more than he needs
a school system.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
Yo, can I help you?

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm looking to work.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,200
Here?

77
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,200
Yeah, you need anyone?

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
How old are you?

79
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Eighteen.

80
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,400
A-ight, man, I'm fifteen.

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,900
- I mean, yo, I can give you
a form to fill out,

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,100
but the manager, he ain't gonna
hire no one under seventeen.

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,500
Hey, yo.

84
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,200
You used to run
with the boy Namond, right?

85
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,200
Yeah, I used to be
on them Fayette corners.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
- Oh yeah, man, I remember you.

87
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,700
- Yeah, I just got tired,
ya know?

88
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,700
Shit got old.

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
So, I guess you need to bang
a while longer,

90
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:39,600
then come back,
see if we got something.

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:48,100
Then come back,
see if we got something.

92
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,300
Why me?

93
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,600
Why not somebody from a district

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,600
where they caught
one of your homeless cases?

95
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Well, there's a hitch.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
- This is some
fucked-up McNulty shit.

97
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
I don't want
to get burned here.

98
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,200
And I don't want any
of my guys getting burned.

99
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,100
Look, here's the deal.

100
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
Command is throwing
more resources at me

101
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,500
than I can use
on my homeless stuff.

102
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
I got that covered.

103
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,400
But Lester-- he's got
a fresh line on Marlo Stanfield,

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,600
and he needs people
to run it down.

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,900
A fresh line, huh?

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,500
He's got a fuckin' wire up
is what you mean.

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
- No, no, there's no--
There's no wire--

108
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,900
- Who the fuck are you kidding?

109
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,400
I handed him a fresh cell number
for Stanfield not two weeks ago.

110
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
- Listen, I don't know
anything about any wire.

111
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,700
I'm just saying he's got
a new line on Marlo,

112
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,000
and he needs people
to run it down.

113
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,000
Bosses stiff-armed him?

114
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,000
Jesus.

115
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,300
Guy drops all those
motherfuckers in the vacants.

116
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Yeah.

117
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
- So you're throwing
people over to Lester,

118
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,400
and paying for it
from your case, is that it?

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,700
O.T. out the ass.

120
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,900
- What about the paperwork?

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
I'll take care of that.

122
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,800
All the run sheets,
office reports,

123
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,000
they come through me.

124
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
All your people got to do
is straight police work.

125
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,100
Daniels gave me a free hand

126
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,100
to pull people
from any district.

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:23,000
Just make sure you send me
people who work.

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
McNulty.

129
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,300
What about cars?

130
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,600
- Departmental account
at enterprise downtown.

131
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,900
Get what ya need.

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
- We delay fleet maintenance
for public works

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
over the next three months.

134
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,700
We cut snow removal in half
and pray for global warming.

135
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
That's enough to avoid
any ugly cuts in school funding,

136
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,500
at least for this quarter.

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
- And this funds police
operations fully, correct?

138
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
- They're back
to where they started

139
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,800
before we bled them out.

140
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,800
It's time anyway.

141
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,300
We ducked the teacher layoffs,

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,100
and you got the fifteen points
on the third-grade M.S.A.S.

143
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,300
You can live with that.

144
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,700
But if we don't drop
the crime in this quarter,

145
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
and the next,
you are vulnerable.

146
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,600
It's now or never.

147
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,300
- Besides, you're getting
traction in this homeless thing.

148
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,800
Governor was on Y.P.R.
yesterday,

149
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,400
and Steiner laid him out
for the state cutbacks.

150
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,700
- Health care for the homeless

151
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
have asked for city hall's
steps tomorrow night.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,300
Candlelight vigil.

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,600
You said yes, right?

154
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,800
- Norman told 'em
they could do it

155
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,700
if I got a chance to say
a few choice words, yeah.

156
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
Speak of the devil.

157
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,700
- I just got off the phone
with the "Post."

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
Reporter there wants your comment

159
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
on a story he's workin
about dobey, down in P.G.,

160
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
looking to take you on
in the democratic primary.

161
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
What?

162
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
Dobey's getting in?

163
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,700
- Make matters worse,
Upshaw's telling people

164
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,400
he might just throw in
with said county exec.

165
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,800
Shit, we might have a full-blown
P.G. insurrection on our hands.

166
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
- Why the fuck would they do that?

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
- Lots of pissed off
black folks down there.

168
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,300
Lot of grumblin' about always
a bridesmaid, never the bride.

169
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,300
- No way can Dobey
take the statehouse.

170
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
All he's gonna do
is bloody us up

171
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
and make uspend money
we're gonna need in the general.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,900
- When we went a-calling
in P.G. last month,

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
who'd you see?

174
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,500
Steny.

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Maloney, Miller, those guys.

176
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,600
White, white and white.

177
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,000
Not even a cup of coffee with
poor old congressman Upshaw.

178
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,300
- I wasn't snubbing the guy.

179
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,600
- Folks down there are tired
of being taken for granted.

180
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,300
- Fuck, I gotta kiss a ring,
don't I?

181
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,800
- More than a ring, actually.

182
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Unlimited O.T.

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
That's what I'm told.

184
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
- But you're sayin' we might not
be working the homeless cases.

185
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,600
Not all the time.

186
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
Major crimes
has a drug investigation

187
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,300
that may also need
surveillance work.

188
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,500
- Shit, who cares
what we work?

189
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
I need the money.

190
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,200
A-ight then.

191
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
You'll be working
out of homicide.

192
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,100
Report down there
to detective McNulty.

193
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,900
Oh yeah--

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,200
Rented wheels on the backlot.

195
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,000
Fuckin' a.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,400
- Ah, man,
this is beautiful.

197
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,600
Oh, hell yeah.

198
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,100
- It's weird shit,
I gotta say.

199
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,500
Talkin' to a psychopath
like that.

200
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,400
- I interviewed
Dick Cheney once.

201
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,400
Whaddaya you think, gus?

202
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,600
Are we hyping this thing,

203
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,000
or is templeton
writing as it lays?

204
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Police say it's real.

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,000
- An' those photographs
he got sent?

206
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
Hey, the guy's fucking missing.

207
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,300
- So I guess now we're writing
homeless stories till december, huh?

208
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Uh-huh.

209
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,000
Why till December?

210
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,400
- Pulitzer submissions
run the calendar year.

211
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,500
Anything a newspaper
cares about at christmas,

212
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,200
they give a fuck
about by new year's.

213
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,700
Homelessness it is there,
gents.

214
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,700
Hold on--

215
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Hold on--

216
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,100
Fella down the lobby says
he wants to talk to an editor.

217
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
What kind of editor?

218
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,500
- The kind that worked on the
story about that homeless vet.

219
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
Scott's piece?

220
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,800
Sure they don't want
to talk to Scott?

221
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,000
- Says Templeton won't
take his calls anymore,

222
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,600
so he walked over here
to talk to somebody else.

223
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,600
Tell him
someone's coming down.

224
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,700
That all he say?

225
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,900
- Just walked up
and said he got Savino.

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
Said he gonna get
more of our muscle

227
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,500
if Marlo don't come
to the street and step to him.

228
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,100
Good thing he didn't make me
from Monk's apartment though.

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I kept on lookin' away
from the motherfucker,

230
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,000
hopin' he ain't remember me--

231
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,900
He was limpin' bad, too.

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,500
He had a crutch.

233
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,100
Wasn't lyin' about
Savino, was he?

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,200
Everybody sayin'
Omar's on this warpath.

235
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,200
Heard he got a stash house
last week.

236
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,200
Everybody's--

237
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,900
- Everybody need to
shut the fuck up.

238
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,400
Look, I'm just sayin',

239
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,100
if Marlo was all that over
June bug callin' him a name,

240
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,100
so that y'all dropped June
and his whole family,

241
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,700
then what the fuck?

242
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,500
Omar out here callin' bitches
every damn day.

243
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Fuck Omar.

244
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,600
- What? What ya think we ain't
gonna catch this dicksucker?

245
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,900
This nigga gonna get got.

246
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,500
Y'all gonna tell Marlo?

247
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,100
- We tell him,
we don't tell him.

248
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,700
- Man got enough on his plate.

249
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,400
- Young'n's on some different
opinion shit there.

250
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,700
- I dunno. If I was Marlo--

251
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,400
Motherfucker, you ain't.

252
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,800
Raspberry?

253
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,900
Wild strawberry.

254
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,000
What?

255
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,200
Nothing, man.

256
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,200
- C'mon, man.
We gotta get across town.

257
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
- This bitch is gonna tell you
where there's construction.

258
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,900
It's gonna tell you left,
gonna tell you right.

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
Pretty much blow you
if you ask nice.

260
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,100
And look--

261
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,800
- Yo, you gotta play some old
school R&B shit on that, man.

262
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,700
- New car, O.T.
this fuckin' detail, man.

263
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,100
I hope we never catch
this goofy motherfucker.

264
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,800
- Hey, officers. Lookey here.

265
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,800
You got two young bucks
'round the corner.

266
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,400
One in the white tee,
the other guy a throwback on.

267
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,800
One got the jump his dip.

268
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,700
And the one with
a car tire, ya feel me?

269
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
'Round the corner?

270
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,800
Fulton and Lex.

271
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,800
A-ight.

272
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,800
Thanks, man.

273
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,100
Yeah.

274
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,300
Mr. Hanning?

275
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,000
It's an honor for me
to meet you, sir.

276
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Who are you?

277
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
My name's Gus Haynes.

278
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,600
I edited the story
you're featured in.

279
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,000
- Then you're
a fucking liar.

280
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,200
- Omar.
It's omar, yo.

281
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,000
- Gotta giddy
up an' go, dawg.

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,500
Get!

283
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,700
One...

284
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,400
Two...

285
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,700
Three...

286
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,700
Four.

287
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,500
Ya see there?

288
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Omar know which one it is.

289
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,300
Look like all your muscle
done up and indisposed now.

290
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,500
So you might as well go ahead
and drop it out, ya feel me?

291
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--

292
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:19,400
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--

293
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
You workin'
a Stanfield corner,

294
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,400
which means you workin'
for a straight up punk.

295
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,700
Ya feel me?

296
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,900
I'm out here in these streets
every day.

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
Me an' my lonesome.

298
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,700
An' where he at? Huh?

299
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,500
Yo, y'all put it in his ear.

300
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Marlo Stanfield is not
a man for this town.

301
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,500
Ya dig?

302
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,200
Mmm-hmm--

303
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,700
Yeah--

304
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, eight men, four cars.

305
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,100
Ellis briefed 'em.
They know what's what.

306
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,100
No, they're just happy
for the O.T.

307
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Look, don't worry, Lester.

308
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,700
- Just sign the motherfucker
and shut the fuck up.

309
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,900
Gimme.

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,900
We ready?

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
'cause you gotta figure
an extra hour

312
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,200
to get 'round the capital
beltway this time of day.

313
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,400
You ever done
an F.B.I. profile before?

314
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,400
Once.

315
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,300
How'd it go?

316
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Oh, they take your file,

317
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,000
read you back some shit
you already know.

318
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,100
Then why do it?

319
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,800
So that we can say we did.

320
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:14,200
- Need a pack of Newport.
Soft pack.

321
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:21,100
- Need a pack of Newport.
Soft pack.

322
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,200
And let me get one
of them, too--

323
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,500
Ahhhh!

324
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
Don't shoot!

325
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,500
- Lowenthal.
Where the fuck is he?

326
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,700
Um, he's, uh--

327
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,200
There you go, Bunk.

328
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,700
- Hey. Request for
a D.N.A. comparison.

329
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,000
case 06H271.

330
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,500
Latent trace
to obtained samples.

331
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
And it's a part of
the serial killer thing.

332
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,400
It's now a part
of that investigation.

333
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Well, that's different.

334
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
If it's connected
to that investigation--

335
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,600
- it is. It is, here.

336
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,600
It's in my notes.

337
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,500
- I never said
I was in a fire fight.

338
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Not on that day.

339
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,200
- I'm sorry, but you did.

340
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,000
- I told you the lead vehicle
took a hit from an elevated I.E.D.

341
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
killed the fifty gunner,

342
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,300
and blew the hands
off the driver.

343
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,200
That's it.
That's enough, man.

344
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Why you go and make
the rest of that shit up?

345
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
- I didn't make anything up.

346
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,300
We sat there having coffee--

347
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,300
Coffee--

348
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,300
- Having donuts and coffee.

349
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,700
- And you said--
- What I say?

350
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,300
- Can I finish?
- I don't know.

351
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,600
I'm hearing about coffee
and donuts, I'm not hearing--

352
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
- Can I finish? If you're not going
to let me tell my side of the story--

353
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
- A lie ain't a side of the story,

354
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,200
it's just a lie.

355
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,600
- I don't have to listen to this--

356
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,800
- Okay-- hey, Scott,
let's just relax here.

357
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,300
Both you gentlemen, let's just
step back here, please?

358
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,600
Now, Mr. Hanning, forgive me,

359
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,900
but do you drink much?

360
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
- You think I fucking sleep
under a bridge sober?

361
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,900
- Sometimes when I have a few--
And I do like to have a few--

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,300
I tend to be a little more
descriptive in the telling of a tale.

363
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
In fact--

364
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,700
- I know what it
is to tell a story.

365
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,700
I've told plenty in my time.

366
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
But there's some things
that happen,

367
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
you don't ever fuck with them.

368
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,300
Scott?

369
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,500
- I believe you, mr. Hanning.

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
I believe that you believe.

371
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,500
That you believe
you told me one thing.

372
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,200
But, sir, with all
due respect and gratitude

373
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,000
for you and the service
you gave to this country,

374
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,800
you didn't tell me that thing.

375
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,500
You told me something else.

376
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,300
I wrote what mr. Hanning
told me.

377
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
Mr. Hanning--

378
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
- I know you probably--
- What if one of the guys,

379
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,400
what if a marine
who was there--

380
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,900
He reads that shit
that you made up?

381
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,500
That's why
I come down here today.

382
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,100
What if one of the guys
sees that?

383
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Man, get him outta my face.

384
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,800
- Guy's just off.
Off in general.

385
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,500
Off his meds.
I dunno, but off.

386
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,900
A lot of them are, you know.

387
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,700
- I mean, I hate to say it--
- Yeah, he puts on a good front.

388
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,000
We'll call the marines,
get a service record,

389
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,000
reach out to some people
in his unit,

390
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,000
find out what the fuck happened
that day outside of--

391
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,400
What was it? Fallujah?

392
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
Yeah.

393
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,500
- Alright, if it went down
the way you said,

394
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,100
we'll let it be.

395
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,100
But if not, we'll chalk it up
as a misunderstanding.

396
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
But misunderstanding or no,

397
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,200
we will write a correction if
what we printed wasn't accurate.

398
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
- And we didn't have coffee.

399
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,400
We had chocolate milk.

400
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,500
- You Miss what you had, though?

401
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,000
- I still got too much dog in me
to be settled like that.

402
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,100
It wasn't Cheryl. It was me.

403
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,000
Thing is, is I found a connect
with the boy, you know?

404
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,100
That part of it
feels right to me.

405
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,900
Kids are great.

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,600
Yeah.

407
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,600
What about you an' Beadie?

408
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,600
You were quiet there
for a time.

409
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Yeah.

410
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,700
Bunk once told me
I'm no good for people.

411
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
Everyone around me,
he said.

412
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,600
Was he drunk?

413
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,700
- Yeah. But still.

414
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,200
- Omar be dead.
I'm tellin' you.

415
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Heard that before.

416
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,300
F'real.

417
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
You see him?

418
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,000
- Seen his dead ass
layin' right up in there.

419
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,200
Boy up on the corner say
he try to rob them Koreans

420
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,900
and got kilt.

421
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,300
- You shoulda let me give him
the years, Bunk.

422
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,500
He'da been better off.

423
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
Thanks for calling.

424
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
- Figured you'd wanna see this,

425
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,500
you being so tight with the mope.

426
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,100
Professional job here.

427
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,500
- Nah. Thought so at first,

428
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,700
but the Korean broad
we sent downtown

429
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,100
said he got done in by a short
little fella with a big gun.

430
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,700
Shit, walked in
an' lit his ass up.

431
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
How short?

432
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,500
The boy robbed him?

433
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,200
- Counterlady said the hoppers
all ran up in here

434
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,800
afterward for souvenirs.

435
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
Took his shotty
and his semiauto too.

436
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Ran all through his pockets.

437
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,800
Be my guest.

438
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,400
- Back on the hunt, were you?

439
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,700
- Youngun say
he out here with no car,

440
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,500
walkin' with a limp an' shit.

441
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,800
He gonna fall, Chris.

442
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,600
You gonna see.

443
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,900
Marlo need a meet.

444
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,600
For real?

445
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,100
- Leander, where we at?

446
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,300
Still setting this up.

447
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,200
Why, did you catch
another one?

448
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,000
- Six-fifty-five
and thirty-four.

449
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,400
- Well, we're not
on anybody yet,

450
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
so we'll pick it up
in the morning.

451
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,200
- Alright. Later.

452
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,400
Okay.

453
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,600
Doze, Truck,
you're on Monk Metcalf.

454
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,600
Bobby, you and Brian
are on Chris Partlow.

455
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,500
He usually rides
with Snoop Pearson,

456
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,800
but if they split,

457
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,300
Karen and Tony
will pick up on her.

458
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,500
Marcus, Angela--

459
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,300
You're the backup unit
when we need one.

460
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
- You're gonna be Stanfield?
- Yeah.

461
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,500
All their business
is face-to-face,

462
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,700
and they meet in the open
several times a day.

463
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,500
We're just trying to find
the pattern in the meets.

464
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,900
- Where do we pick
these guys up?

465
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,400
- Stanfield has every corner
between M.L.K. and Monroe,

466
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,600
and they start shaping it up
around eleven or so, okay?

467
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,500
That's when the re-up orders
start coming in,

468
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,800
that's when you'll start to see
monk making the rounds.

469
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,600
Most mornings, Marlo starts off
with a parley or two

470
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,000
on the playground
between Mosher and Lanvale.

471
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,900
Now, these guys
seem to be wholesaling, too.

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
Other dealers, players--

473
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,700
Anyone who wants to get
with him gets him there, okay?

474
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,300
Chris and Snoop
are usually with him.

475
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,200
And McNulty's got you
covered for paperwork.

476
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,800
None of what we do here
is necessary for court,

477
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,700
so rest easy on that,
alright?

478
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,600
So we stage here
tomorrow at nine.

479
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,300
No sign of him,

480
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,400
but I ain't on nothin' else
for as long as it take.

481
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,500
- You ain't heard?
Omar bagged up.

482
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,900
Shit, I thought y'all
was gonna tell me.

483
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,200
I just got the word myself
from Monk.

484
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,400
- Who got him?
- Some young boy.

485
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,100
- Who?
- Ain't heard a name.

486
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,100
Don't even know
if there was a why.

487
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,500
Hopper wanna hear a pop,
see the damage, ya know?

488
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Yeah-- that shit is gone.

489
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,000
We done with this
next resupply,

490
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,500
you an' me got some time
in A.C. coming to us, don't we?

491
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,700
- Forensically, this guy
is all over the map.

492
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,300
Sexual to a point,
but inhibited.

493
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Nocturnal on some,
diurnal on the others.

494
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,500
And the notion of targeting
the homeless, to begin with?

495
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,100
Well, we've only seen that
a couple times before,

496
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,100
but in those instances, it's
been someone within that cohort.

497
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
And they're not usually
carrying cell phones

498
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,400
and calling newspapers.

499
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
- You caught
a strange one here.

500
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
- Detectives,
hey, don't get up.

501
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,600
Arthur Toland,
deputy director of the unit.

502
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,800
Just wanted to drop by

503
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,200
and make sure
we're progressing your case.

504
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,600
Great. Thanks.

506
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,000
- You might recognize
the director from television.

507
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,000
He's done all of them.

508
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,600
- You know those news shows.

509
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,400
Always want a talking head
when a case comes up.

510
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Greta van Susteren,
Nancy Grace, Chris Matthews,

511
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,500
that fella with the big
forehead, whatshisname--

512
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
Larry King?

513
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,400
Hey, what the hell.

515
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
It's a chance to get the word
out for the bureau.

516
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,200
And I sell some books.

517
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,300
"Human Hunters: The rise
of the American serial killer"?

518
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,600
They've used a lot of my stuff
on those C.s.I. shows.

519
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,000
I've consulted for them.

520
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,500
You haven't heard--

521
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,500
So, how long you been doing
death investigations?

522
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,100
Eight years.

523
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,500
We don't see a lot of
serial stuff actually.

524
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,700
Drug murders.

525
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,700
A street robbery
every now and then.

526
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,400
- Three hundred or so
a year.

527
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,000
- Well, you've got
a serial case now,

528
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,700
so, I'll leave you to it.

529
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,300
Good hunting.

530
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
- Art was actually
lead investigator

531
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,300
on the unabomber thing.

532
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,000
- That was like
sixteen years, right?

533
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Yeah.

534
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:14,800
- Yeah, then his brother
ratted him out?

535
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,300
- Homeless is in
at thirty inches.

536
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,000
It's good shit there.

537
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
No really.

538
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
There was a real
sense of place,

539
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,400
especially under
the Hanover bridge

540
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,000
when the police came up
under there to give the warning.

541
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,000
Drama in small moments
like that.

542
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
- Truth is,
I had a tour guide.

543
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Yeah?

544
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,600
- Yeah, fella I met
at a soup kitchen.

545
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Volunteer there.

546
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,300
Ex-addict.

547
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,900
There's something
about this guy.

548
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,000
I mean, he's just--

549
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,900
I dunno, the more he talked,
the more I felt like

550
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,900
it was him I really
wanted to write about.

551
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,500
- Yeah?
- But he's not homeless.

552
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,000
And I don't have
any peg for him.

553
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,900
Shit, I don't know
what the story is.

554
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Does he got a name?

555
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,500
Reginald Cousins.

556
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,500
- Volunteers at a soup kitchen.

557
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,500
What's he do for money?

558
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
- Sells the "Baltimore Sun"
every morning

559
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,300
out by Light Street.

560
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,800
- Well, shit not exactly
a growth industry, huh?

561
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,400
- He lives in his
sister's basement.

562
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,300
She'll take a plate down
to him every now and then,

563
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,800
but she won't let him
come up the stairs.

564
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,100
- Spend some time with him.

565
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,100
- What about
the neighborhoods beat?

566
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
The homeless coverage?

567
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
You're covered.

568
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,200
Take a couple weeks,
see what you see.

569
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,300
A-ight?

570
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,100
- Late entries
from the copshop.

571
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,900
Two dead in a
Charles county housefire,

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
and a homicide
from the city.

573
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,000
- Ettlin,
what do we got room for?

574
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
- We're shy one brief
in the metro digest.

575
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,900
Four paragraphs'll fill.

576
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,700
What's the homicide?

577
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,600
- The 34-year-old black male

578
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,300
shot dead in
West Baltimore grocery.

579
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,500
Juvenile suspect
is being sought.

580
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,000
Write up the fire.

581
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,900
Scratch the murder.
We don't have room.

582
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,000
- So what we conclude
from a behavioral analysis

583
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,600
of the known forensics
is the following:

584
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,900
The suspect is likely
a white male,

585
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,700
in his late twenties
to late thirties.

586
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,400
He likely is not
a college graduate,

587
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,100
but feels
nonetheless superior

588
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,000
to those with
advanced education,

589
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,100
and he is likely employed
in a bureaucratic entity,

590
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,800
possibly civil service
or quasi-public service,

591
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,200
from which
heeels alienated.

592
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,600
He has a problem
with authority

593
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,000
and a deep-seated resentment
of those who he feels

594
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
have impeded his progress
professionally.

595
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,500
The minimized sexual activity
suggests

596
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,000
that this is not a primary
motive for the killings.

597
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,500
In fact, the bite marks
in the last found victim--

598
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,400
Lacking the D.N.A. of saliva--

599
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,300
Indicate to us possible
post-mortem staging.

600
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,500
The suspect has trouble
with lasting relationships

601
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,400
and is possibly
a high-functioning alcoholic,

602
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,300
with alcohol being utilized
as a trigger

603
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,000
in the commission
of these crimes.

604
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,000
His resentment
of the homeless

605
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,800
may stem from
a personal relationship

606
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,600
with someone
who is in that cohort,

607
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,300
or his victimization
of vagrants

608
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,300
might merely present
an opportunity for him

609
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,200
to assert his superiority
and intellectual prowess.

610
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
If you get more,
fax it down,

611
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:45,700
and we can
update the profile.

612
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,700
Thanks for everything.

613
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,600
Thanks.

614
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,600
So, what do you think?

615
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,500
They're in the ballpark.

616
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,100
- Look, congressman,
I'll do whatever it takes

617
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,500
to make things right
between us,

618
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,400
but running Dobey in the primary
is only gonna hurt everybody.

619
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,600
You mean hurt you.

620
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,000
- All due respect,
I'm the only viable candidate

621
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,500
to beat that republican prick,
and I know you know that.

622
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,100
And, at the end of the day,
isn't that what it's all about?

623
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,500
Do not waste your breath

624
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,100
tellin' me what I already know
about our tax-cutting,

625
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,500
dump-it-on-the-counties,
ass-kiss-every-business-interest governor.

626
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,800
P.G. county has a hundred murders
a year,

627
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,500
school system held together
with spit and glue,

628
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,200
and worse rush-hour traffic
than Atlanta.

629
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
And the man in Annapolis
wouldn't piss on us

630
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,900
if we were on fire.

631
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,800
- Don't hold back, congressman.

632
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,600
- I'm tired of these
fuckin' republicans.

633
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
- Look, I fucked up
not coming to see you earlier.

634
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,500
But between the votes
I can pull outta Baltimore,

635
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,900
Montgomery and your county,
I am gonna take the statehouse.

636
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,700
And then the frustration
that you feel is gonna end.

637
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,200
I know you've heard this before
from every other sonofabitch,

638
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,200
but congressman,
I give you my word.

639
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,200
- You know, you're right.

640
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,100
I have heard that before.

641
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,800
You wanna keep P.G. county
in your camp,

642
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,000
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than your word.

643
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,700
Fuck.

644
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
You rang?

645
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,100
Funny case you got here.

646
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,000
Your victim had an address.

647
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,500
A home. Paid rent,

648
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,400
so we assume,
maybe even a mortgage.

649
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,800
But not homeless,
in any case.

650
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,300
No strangulation,
no red ribbon--

651
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,000
Christopher Partlow.

652
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,900
A lesser man might get pissy

653
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,600
because you jumped the line,
Bunk.

654
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,600
Me?

655
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,200
I remember Partlow's name
from all those cases last year.

656
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,400
Congrats.

657
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,300
Yeah.

658
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,600
- But don't fuck with me
like this again.

659
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,100
Yeah. Yeah.

660
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,400
- He lied on his mortgage
application, huh?

661
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,600
You know, we have a name
for that over here.

662
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,800
- Yeah, the headshot.
I know.

663
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,300
- On a mortgage charge,
he's certain to plead out.

664
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,800
- Billy doesn't plead
his clients.

665
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,600
- Then he's looking
at a lot of years.

666
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,800
A federal jury is
a very different animal

667
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,400
than what they see
on Calvert Street.

668
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,800
- I tried to tell them that--

669
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,300
- Yeah, but mister Bond
wanted to try is himself,

670
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,200
see if he couldn't grandstand
his way to city hall.

671
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,500
Well, you have the headshot,
detective.

672
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
But no gun with which
to fire it.

673
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,000
We can't take this case.

674
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,300
It's all on paper.

675
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,800
- You had canceled checks.
You had bank accounts.

676
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
You had his bag man
on the stand.

677
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,600
We had a city jury.

678
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,000
- You know, we've been gathering
string on Clay Davis

679
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,200
for six years, detective.

680
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,200
Six years, we've had a file open
on that shakedown artist.

681
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,700
And now, after you
city sons of bitches

682
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,600
have managed, in a single week,
to transform Clay fucking Davis

683
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,700
into Martin Luther King, jr.,
you now come to me with this--

684
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,200
Which you had in your
back pocket all along--

685
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,600
Looking for the federal jury
of mostly white faces

686
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,100
to remedy the problem?

687
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,300
Well, I'm sorry.

688
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,000
Thank you.

689
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What's this?

690
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,300
- From the pocket
of a dead stick-up boy.

691
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,700
Omar Little.

692
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
Omar? Dead?

693
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,400
- You stop readin'
the twenty-fours?

694
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,100
Killed yesterday
at a grocery.

695
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,900
Slow to the draw,
he was.

696
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,100
No shit.

697
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,100
- One to the back
of the head.

698
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,700
Norris and Crutchfield
caught it.

699
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,300
They're looking
for a juvenile.

700
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,000
He was hunting
Stanfield and crew.

701
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,200
And this was on him?

702
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,800
Yep.

703
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,700
Thought of you and Lester
when I saw it.

704
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,500
Payback for you getting me
back some great lab.

705
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,300
Positive D.N.A.
on Chris Partlow.

706
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
An alley beating, not one
of the ones in the vacants.

707
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,100
Motherfucker.

708
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,000
You have all kinds
of news today, don't you?

709
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,600
- Yeah, going for a warrant
right now.

710
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,100
- Hey, can you wait
to serve it?

711
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,300
We're right at the edge, Bunk.

712
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,800
How long?

713
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,200
'cause this is an honest
fuckin' murder prosecution here.

714
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,800
I'll talk to Lester.

715
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,800
Congrats.

716
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,300
- Yeah.
No shuckin', no jivin'.

717
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,300
Just good ol' police work.

718
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,300
How about that, Jimmy?

719
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Hey, without my bullshit,

720
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,800
you're still waiting
on lab work.

721
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,700
- Listen, Jimmy, the Conaway
shooting from Westport?

722
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,100
The transvestite?

723
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,600
I go to VICAP, there's
another one just like it--

724
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,000
Look-- down in Carolina,
four months ago.

725
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
For a road car
and two nights in a hotel,

726
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,700
I can put this down.

727
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
- What are you
talking about?

728
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,300
Yours is a 9 mm,
this one's a 32.

729
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,700
Yours was a bar pick-up,
this one's a home invasion--

730
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,200
- Still worth checking out.

731
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,200
- I don't see it. Sorry.

732
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,100
- You're gonna make me
spit it out, aren't you--

733
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
You ever played Hilton head?

734
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
I get a call from my
brother-in-law a few days ago.

735
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,500
He managed to swing
a tee-time for this weekend.

736
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,100
Jimmy, I'm going, goddammit.

737
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,100
The fuck do I care? Go.

738
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,100
- You know, this is some real
cute shit you're pulling here.

739
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
Taking the detail money

740
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,700
and doling it around
like a priest passing wafers.

741
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,300
Now, I don't know
exactly what you're up to,

742
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,300
but I know this: If someone
picked up a phone around here,

743
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,900
your shit is critically fucked.

744
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,800
Two nights and a road car.

745
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,200
- Leander, I'm showing ten-fifty-five
and thirty-four from Marlo's phone.

746
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,700
Anybody on the move?

747
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,400
- I got him coming eastbound
on Baltimore Street at Calhoun.

748
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,700
Who's on Monk?

749
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,400
Wait one.

750
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,200
Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-eleven.

751
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,300
Where you at, man?

752
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Twenty-three-eleven.

753
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,900
Southbound M.L.K.
approaching route forty.

754
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,200
That's the meet, Lester.

755
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,700
Monk and Marlo on the westside.

756
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
We on it.

757
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
- Corner of Argyle and Dolphin.

758
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,200
Monk and Marlo, as expected.

759
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,700
- Now I got four-forty and
thirty-five coming into Marlo's phone.

760
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,200
- Yeah, he's scoping that, Lester.

761
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,500
- We know it ain't Monk callin'.

762
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,200
- Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-twelve.

763
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,200
Twenty-three twelve.

764
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Who do you have eyes on?

765
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,300
Both my subjects.

766
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
- They go to
their cell phones?

767
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,400
Negative.

768
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,000
They on the move?

769
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,200
Negative.

770
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,700
Twenty-three-fourteen.

771
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,400
- We got nothing moving either.
- No one elscalling or moving.

772
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,200
- Means we got somebody else
on this network

773
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,100
we don't yet know.

774
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,300
Oh, boy.

775
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,400
- Hey, man.
Let me give you a hand.

776
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,400
Alright, you ready?

777
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,000
ah.

778
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,900
- I don't have no money
in the moment,

779
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,100
but I'll be going down
to the scales in a hour or two.

780
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,800
You help me out,
I'll go ten for your trouble.

781
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,300
You help me out,
I'll go ten for your trouble.

782
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,600
Got a rag
for that behind you.

783
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Junk!
Junkman!

784
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,000
Junk! Junk!

785
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,500
Junkman! Junk!

786
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,800
- Where the fuck are you going?

787
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,400
- Oh, uh, I gotta see Lester about--

788
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,000
What's all that?

789
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,000
- Parole info on known
sex offenders for five zip codes.

790
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,800
I've also got background
info on my desk

791
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,800
for everyone we picked up
at pier five with a cell phone.

792
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,600
- You're actually gonna--
- Compare the F.B.I. profile

793
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,700
with every person of interest
I can find.

794
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,200
Hell yeah, somebody's gotta.

795
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,300
- Come here.
- The fuck are you doin'?

796
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,900
Come here.

797
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,200
- Maurice Dobey?
For governor?

798
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,900
Of my state? Sheet.

799
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
That's some cynical politics,
right there.

800
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,600
Playin' like you gonna
run a man you know can't win

801
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,800
to scare people
into payin' off.

802
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,300
- Dobey could
bloody you up, Tommy.

803
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,100
In Baltimore and P.G. both.

804
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,900
- Playin' that race card.
Shameful.

805
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,700
- What does Upshaw want
to stay out of the race?

806
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,700
Too much.

807
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Are you going to pay?

808
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,800
- Well, let's just say
I'm in negotiations.

809
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
- Well, I'll do everything
I can to make sure

810
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,200
this insurrection
doesn't spread into the city.

811
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,700
- Wonderful! And how much
is the loyal support

812
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,300
of the eastside democratic
coalition going to cost me?

813
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,200
- Only an endorsement,
given that this man right here

814
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,800
is still standing,
I don't believe that Rupert Bond

815
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,400
is going to find his way
into this office.

816
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,600
Do you?

817
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
And for my endorsement,
you will return the favor

818
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,200
and ignore our friends
in Prince George's.

819
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,200
And the loyalty
of the westside

820
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,900
is going to cost me
what exactly?

821
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,400
Oh, nothin' big.

822
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,700
You got three seats comin' open
on the liquor board.

823
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,900
You get one seat.

824
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,700
Two, and you have me out there
raising money for you in the primary.

825
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,200
Sold. And Clay, it scares me
to think of the damage

826
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,500
you could do with two votes
on the liquor board.

827
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,400
It ain't right.

828
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,500
No... It just is.

829
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,200
No, I mean, you can't do this.

830
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,700
We're doing it. Whatever
they give us to work the bullshit,

831
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I throw it to Lester.
Or Crutchfield, or Norris,

832
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,900
or Anyone else who has a case
that oughta be solved.

833
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,500
it was bad enough I wasted your day
yesterday going to Quantico,

834
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,400
I can't stand to see you wasting
any more time on this,

835
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,200
you should be back working
your home invasion.

836
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,600
- Jimmy, you can't do this.
- A couple days more.

837
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,700
Lester gets his best shot
at Marlo, after that

838
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,100
we'll never hear from
the reprimande killer again.

839
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,800
Bosses will lose interest, I'll pretend
to run out of little more string.

840
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,800
And then it goes right back to
the admin office. No harm, no foul.

841
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,000
Whatever you need, Kima...

842
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,800
to work your triple,
or any case that matters to you.

843
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,300
Manpower, O.T., labwork, cars...

844
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Just let me know.

845
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,200
I gotta go.

846
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,300
Wake up!

847
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,600
Hey, bug! Up here.

848
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
Hold, boy.

849
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,700
I'll get you that 10 tomorrow.
And if you're looking for work,

850
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,400
I got work needs lifting.

851
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,900
You know the stable on Booth Street?
Be there before 9.

852
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Dang, dukie,
you ain't ready now?

853
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,700
I'm showing 5:15 and 34 seconds.

854
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,800
I'm up Park Heights,
but I lost him just past the park.

855
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,100
M.T.A. bus clipped a curb

856
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,900
and it knocked down
a utility pole.

857
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,700
By the time I detoured,
he slipped me good.

858
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Well, let me know.

859
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,400
Big news.

860
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,100
Bunk has a murder warrant
on Chris Partlow.

861
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,400
The hell you say.

862
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,800
- Not one from the vacants.

863
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
D.N.A. match
on an alley beating.

864
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,100
He lets this go now,

865
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,600
these guys are gonna
go to ground.

866
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,300
We're right at the edge
of something here.

867
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,200
- He's giving us
a couple of days.

868
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
He owes me.

869
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,200
I expedited his lab work
for it.

870
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,200
Oh, and Omar Little?
Stickup-boy?

871
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,400
What about him?

872
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,900
- Caught one in a Korean joint
over westside.

873
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,500
Bunk pulled that
out of his pocket.

874
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,000
Mean anything at all to us?

875
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,800
- Look's like he was
after Marlo's crew.

876
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,300
Cheese. Cheese Wagstaff?

877
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,300
In addition to their corners,

878
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,000
these guys are wholesaling
all over town at this point,

879
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,900
so I figured cheese
was just one of many.

880
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,200
- Note reads like Omar
had him under Marlo'wing.

881
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,900
A lieutenant, at least.

882
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,200
Anyway, I gotta go,

883
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,800
do more pretending
for the rest of the city.

884
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,500
Oh, by the way,
I--I told Greggs.

885
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,300
- Oh, McNulty.
How many more people--

886
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,600
- She was about to jump into
the serial murders with both feet.

887
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,500
I couldn't stand
to spin her like that--

888
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,300
How'd she take it?

889
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,600
- Twenty-three-oh-six to
any twenty-three sequence.

890
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,900
Trying to reconnect
with my subject.

891
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,600
- Anyone near Northwest
who can assist?

892
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,600
- Twenty-three-fifteen
to twenty-three-oh-six.

893
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,300
I'm in the twenty-eight
hundred block

894
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,900
Edgecombe Circle south,
sitting on the female subject.

895
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,700
Maybe that's the other end
of your meet.

896
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,700
Edgecombe Circle?

897
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,700
Where's that, twenty?

898
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,900
It runs off Pall mall.

899
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,300
Where's Pall mall?

900
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,800
I'm not too good up
in the Northwest.

901
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,900
It's between Pimlico--

902
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,800
- Never mind, I got a map book.

903
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,200
Okay, see what we got here.

904
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:24,000
Map thirty-four,
grid e-three.

905
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:30,500
Thirty-four, e-three,
thirty-four, e-three--

906
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:37,300
Three--

907
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Whaddya got?

908
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,300
- Lester, what'd that
last clock show?

909
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,800
- And these people that I
share the stage with tonight

910
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,300
are here as representatives
of the hundreds,

911
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,500
no, the thousands of citizens
without shelter,

912
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,100
without protection,
in this city tonight.

913
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,000
Why does this have to be?

914
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,700
Certainly, the last seven years

915
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,600
have not brought the same levels
of federal commitment

916
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,200
to American cities as from
previous administrations.

917
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,400
And certaiy, our governor
has in the last year

918
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,900
placed severe restrictions on whatever
stopgap state programs were in place.

919
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,600
And what little remained
of our so-called safety net

920
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,100
was simply shredded,

921
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,600
and more and more
of our fellow citizens

922
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,200
found themselves living life
at the broken edges,

923
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,900
in the street.

924
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, I say that this is
not on tragic,

925
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,800
it is unforgivable!

926
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,100
And I am here to say
that no longer can these people

927
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,900
with whom I share this stage
tonight be invisible,

928
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,600
just, just, just as all of those
without shelter in this city,

929
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,900
in this country, can
no longer be invisible to us.

930
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,200
And it is regrettable
that it has taken the actions

931
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,600
of a remorseless predator
to make us reflect.

932
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,900
But we in Baltimore
have been tested,

933
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and we have been taught
that all of our citizens

934
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,600
deserve the full protection
of the law,

935
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,100
and the full support
of the community.

936
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

937
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,000
and to all the other ills
that prey on those

938
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,900
without shelter in our city--

939
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,600
Not tonight
can you prey on them.

940
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,800
And not tomorrow.
Not any longer.

941
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We will protect you!

942
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,900
Thank you.

943
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,600
- She asked you keep
that one stirred.

944
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,000
- Hey, you were
on my thing, right?

945
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,300
I guess I owe you
a drink on that.

946
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,500
What's your poison?

947
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,800
- I'm okay, senator,
thank you very much.

948
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,200
Obonda, huh?

949
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,700
That's a good one.

950
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,600
You know, that was mostly my
evidence you beat back there, right?

951
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
You think you
could do that again?

952
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,100
Excuse me?

953
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,100
- 'Cept this time,
the jury's a federal one.

954
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,200
Say, nine white, three black.

955
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,400
- Time for you
to tip on out, detective.

956
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,800
- Bank records
on that mortgage application

957
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,800
you made on the Calvert county
property years back.

958
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,000
Now, why don't you
take that back to Billy Murphy?

959
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,500
Ask your attorney
what you're exposed to.

960
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:51,200
At this point, this is just between
us two gentlemen here, senator.

961
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,300
And no one else
till I make it so.

962
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,300
What?

963
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,200
You tryin' to sell
a case back to me?

964
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,000
Motherfucker,
if you don't get--

965
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,300
- I don't get paid
like that.

966
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,000
I get paid when
I come back up in here

967
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,700
a couple nights time
with questions.

968
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,000
And you, sir, have answers.

969
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,900
Or my next call will be
to the U.S. Attorney's office,

970
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,300
and we will go again.

971
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,600
But for real.

972
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:18,500
You can keep tt copy.
Ma'am.

973
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:26,200
You can keep that copy.
Ma'am.

974
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,600
- Just to let you know,
before the fireworks start,

975
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,500
I'm spiking this lede
and I'll play it straight.

976
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,600
But you got back?

977
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,700
As best I can.

978
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,500
Scott!

979
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,000
I'm spiking your lede.

980
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,300
I'm not running a story
about a public gathering--

981
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,600
A candlelight vigil
at city hall, in fact--

982
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,500
Where the lede anecdote and quote
is from an unnamed homeless woman.

983
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,200
- She doesn't want to be
known as homeless.

984
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,700
I explained that.

985
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,800
- Scott, there were hundreds of
homeless down there tonight--

986
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,700
People who voluntarily
attended this event.

987
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,500
And I'm gonna guess
that any number of them

988
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,500
would've let you put
their names in the paper.

989
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,100
- But her story is great.
Look at that quote--

990
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,200
It's a perfect quote.

991
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,700
Best quote
I could ever ask for.

992
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,100
Jesus Christ.

993
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,700
To hell with you
if you think I made it up.

994
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,400
- We have a standard
that we follow here.

995
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,800
And I'm gonna follow it.

996
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,400
Here it comes, Gus.

997
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,800
Yep.

998
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,500
- Gus, you're retopping
Scott's vigil copy?

999
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,800
I am.

1000
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,100
But I thought--

1001
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,500
- Anonymous attribution
in a public setting.

1002
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,000
There's no need for it.

1003
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,200
Gus, let's discuss this.

1004
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,400
- Actually, I did discuss it.

1005
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,000
I discussed it with
the metro editor,

1006
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,000
and he agrees.

1007
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,100
Now, the story's
on the copy desk,

1008
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,700
and as a line editor
working this story,

1009
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,500
I feel I've done my job.

1010
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,800
Now, you as the M.E.,
if you want to go another way,

1011
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,500
you pull the story back
and re-edit.

1012
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,400
But we have a sourcing
policy here,

1013
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,200
and I knowt,
and I do not feel comfortable

1014
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,100
bending the rules
in this instance.

1015
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,700
G'night.

1016
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,400
Yeah?

1017
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,900
- McNulty, it's Christeson.

1018
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,700
Listen, my case is down an'

1019
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,700
I wanted to thank you.

1020
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,500
I couldn't have done it
otherwise.

1021
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,900
No problem.

1022
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,600
Hey. It went great.

1023
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,600
Kids asleep?

1024
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,600
- Yeah, but they saw you
on W.B.A.L.

1025
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,200
Anna said your hair
looked funny.

1026
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,500
- Well, just so long as
she was impressed.

1027
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,000
CNN was there.

1028
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,700
I wonder if they'll cycle
any coverage through tonight.

1029
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,500
- A good day
for his honor, huh?

1030
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,700
I dunno.

1031
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,300
Nerese shook me down
for a mayoral endorsement,

1032
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,600
and Clay Davis,
back from the grave,

1033
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,500
took a couple
liquor board seats.

1034
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,000
Just so as they won't join
in Upshaw's little warparty

1035
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,100
down in Prince George's.

1036
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,300
- You're gonna endorse Nerese?

1037
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,000
You told me you prefer Bond.

1038
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,200
- I do, but this thing
with Upshaw--

1039
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,000
Shit, I might even
have to give him a bump

1040
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,400
just to calm him down.

1041
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,100
- God. What's he asking?

1042
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,000
There-- look.

1043
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,900
What's Upshaw asking?

1044
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,100
- Half of any extra school
or anti-crime money

1045
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,700
I get outta the legislature
for Baltimore

1046
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,200
would go to P.G. county.

1047
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,200
- You take that deal
and Baltimore's out

1048
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,500
half of what you want to bring
back to the city schools.

1049
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,800
- Yeah, but if I don't win, Jen,
I bring back exactly nothing.

1050
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,700
Look.

1051
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,800
- And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

1052
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,000
and to all the other ills--

1053
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,800
- Go on. Straight to bed.

1054
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,800
Hey, kiddo.

1055
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,500
Hey, McNulty.

1056
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,100
Where'd you go to?

1057
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,200
- None of your business
really, Jimmy.

1058
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,900
Next time,
I'm not going anywhere.

1059
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,400
Next time, you're gonna
be out on your ass,

1060
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,200
because that's my fucking house.

1061
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,000
That's police work, son.

1062
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,100
- I pull the A.D.C. book
to find a location,

1063
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,500
and I'm on the same page number
as the second hand.

1064
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,800
And I remember
we had a lotta clocks

1065
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,200
with thirty-four seconds.

1066
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,800
- That's a page
from West Baltimore.

1067
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,100
Right.

1068
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,600
Now, the second hand
is always the map page.

1069
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,700
Longitude, A-through-K,
is the hour,

1070
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,600
and for the latitude, they go
by five-minute intervals.

1071
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,600
Now they know
the meeting spot in advance,

1072
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,200
and they code it
by the grid square.

1073
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,000
But if the clock
has nothing to do with time,

1074
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,400
how do they know when to meet?

1075
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,400
- Everything's less than
a half hour of driving,

1076
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,800
even in traffic.

1077
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,900
My guess is
that the standing logic

1078
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,100
is that they meet
within an hour or so.

1079
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,900
You know what else
makes sense?

1080
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,400
This clock face when no one
was on the move?

1081
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,300
The times are all
at thirty-five seconds.

1082
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,200
And that's the page
for East Bawlmer.

1083
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,800
Cheese.

1084
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,700
Cheese Wagstaff?

1085
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,300
- Marlo's wholesaling
on the westside through Monk,

1086
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,300
and on the eastside with Cheese.

1087
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,200
He's got the whole goddamn city.

1088
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,600
- How do we know it's Cheese?

1089
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,500
oh--

1090
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,900
You, too, huh?

1091
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,600
You all are good with this?

1092
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,200
Kima--

1093
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,900
Not me.

1094
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,300
All the guys at the bar,
Jimmy?

1095
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
All the girls?

1096
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,700
They don't show up
at your wake.

1097
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,500
Not because
they don't like you

1098
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,000
but because they never
knew your last name.

1099
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,500
A month later, someone tells 'em
"oh, Jimmy died."

1100
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,000
"Jimmy who?"

1101
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,100
"Jimmy the cop."

1102
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,400
"Ohh," they say. "Him."

1103
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,600
And all the people on the job,

1104
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,600
all the people you spent all
those hours in the radio car with,

1105
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,500
the guys with their feet up
on their desk telling stories,

1106
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,300
who shorted you
on the food runs,

1107
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,900
who signed your
overtime slips.

1108
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,900
In the end, they're not
gonna be there either.

1109
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,400
Family. That's it.

1110
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,500
Family.

1111
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,200
And if you're lucky,

1112
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,700
one or two friends
who are the same as family.

1113
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
That's all
the best of us get.

1114
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,900
Everything else is just--

1115
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,800
- There is no serial killer.

1116
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,600
There are no murders.
I made it all up.

1117
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,600
They were-- they were
shutting us down.

1118
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,800
They were-- they were just--

1119
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,000
It's hard to explain.

1120
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,900
I don't even know
where the anger comes from.

1121
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,700
I don't know
how to make it stop.

1122
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:22,100
They fucking task me, they do.

1123
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,500
We took the money from
the bullshit investigation,

1124
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,300
and we routed it to Lester.

1125
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,100
Now he's got the cake
to take down Marlo Stanfield.

1126
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,500
And now that I've
done all this--

1127
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,500
Now that I've
watched myself do it,

1128
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:40,600
I can't even stand to--

1129
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,800
Lester says he's close.

1130
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,900
Time will pass,

1131
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,200
and I'll be able
to shut this thing down.

1132
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,600
If you don't go to jail.

1133
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,200
You had no fucking right.

1134
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:04,400
- I know.
- This is my life, too.

1135
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,400
You start to tell the story;
you think you're the hero.

1136
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:20,300
And then, when you get done
talking, you--

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
