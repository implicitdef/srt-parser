2
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:08,419
That gentleman and his
daughter, the money they took,

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,410
ain't never coming back.

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,603
We're going to recreate

5
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:13,836
my father's system here without my father.

6
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:16,417
A consortium with all of
you sharing in the profits.

7
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:19,207
I'll do that the moment you
lift the ban on Captain Vane.

8
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,503
Charles Vane is an animal.

9
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:22,291
You have until dark to come to your senses.

10
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:24,462
Do you have some problem with
us holding onto that whore?

11
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:26,844
It's up to us when we're done with her.

12
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:31,639
Hunting the Maria Aleyne
was never about money.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,317
It was an execution.

14
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:36,880
Good men will die for some hidden agenda,

15
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,708
the Barlow woman's agenda.

16
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:41,684
Boston is more forgiving of one's past.

17
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:45,735
With my family's assistance,
one might find a new life there.

18
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:47,375
Andromache's manned like a warship.

19
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:50,277
Sixty men, at least. And they're fighters.

20
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:52,795
He's in a reinforced hold.

21
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:54,703
There's no way to get
the guns off the boat.

22
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:57,695
Anybody we send down there is
just gonna get cut to shreds.

23
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:01,251
Bryson: Mr. Guthrie's orders were explicit.

24
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:03,507
No matter what, I was to make
sure that you were on this ship.

25
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:06,405
"I sent a message to the
Captain of the Scarborough.

26
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,478
I told him where he would find you."

27
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:11,898
Good God, the Scarborough!

28

29
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,590
How far have we drifted?

30
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,952
Not far. A few miles.

31
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,269
Fucking Scarborough's out there, Billy.

32
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:33,783
I can feel it.

33
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:37,055
Just waiting for a whiff of us
so she can set those guns ablaze.

34
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,953
Lars is almost ready.

35
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:41,374
He'll have that bunker open in no time.

36
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,907
Four hours till sunup.

37
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:50,283
If we can't get those guns before then,

38
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:53,335
Flint will let us leave, right?

39
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,213
Here you go.

40
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,712
The wick's fast, so don't light her

41
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,416
until you're right up to the bunker.

42
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,420
Get it through the murder
hole and then take cover.

43
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,546
The vanguard will be right behind you.

44
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,283
While Bryson and his men
are choking on the smoke,

45
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,561
we'll bust down the door, take him out,

46
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:31,205
grab our guns and be on the way home.

47
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:38,045
Did he say anything to you?

48
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:43,017
About what?

49
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,668
Bryson slipping off with
our guns is one thing,

50
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,938
but bringing the Scarborough with him?

51
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,051
How did he even know the Navy was around?

52
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,223
Richard Guthrie must have been involved.

53
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:57,871
No shit. Do you think?

54
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,544
Where I get confused
is that Richard Guthrie

55
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,989
was supposed to be under guard
at the Barlow woman's home.

56
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,386
Isn't that what he told us?

57
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:07,201
I mean, what do we really know about her?

58
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,144
She shares his love of books?

59
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:14,572
Isn't it about time we start
asking some real questions?

60
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,270
Billy, not now.

61
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:18,537
Please.

62
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,079
He wants you to take it.

63
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:06,838
To place it in the hole above your head.

64
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,591
To signal to pirates.

65
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:15,583
He says if we help them,

66
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,291
they'll bring us back to their home.

67
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,467
No.

68
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:24,761
- He says...
- I know what he says.

69
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,730
He says in Nassau a slave can be free,

70
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:30,519
get a job and a wage.

71
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,548
Maybe for him. He's strong.

72
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:34,663
A few others.

73
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,254
The rest of you, don't kid yourself.

74
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,853
You are cargo, in Nassau or otherwise.

75
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,181
You would decide this for us all?

76
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:44,809
This has nothing to do with you.

77
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,876
We have a chance to be free.

78
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:48,695
I don't care.

79
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,698
There are weapons on this ship

80
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,784
the pirates plan to return to Nassau,

81
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:58,329
weapons that are very
dangerous to someone I love.

82
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,999
No matter what happens to me or to you,

83
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:05,711
those weapons must not be returned.

84
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:55,149
Lilywhite: Time has
come for us to tell those

85
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,345
who are aiming to make us slaves

86
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:00,723
they are no longer welcome in this place.

87
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,313
Not any longer!

88
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,613
Fuck 'em! Fucking bastards.

89
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,863
No fucking longer.

90
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:08,732
Two hours.

91
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,598
Two fucking hours she's
been holed up in there.

92
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:15,240
Well, I for one think this is a good sign.

93
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:19,284
What?

94
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,879
Clearly she's taking
the decision seriously.

95
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,826
I'm sorry, you think it's a good
sign she's taking this seriously?

96
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,774
I can't even... Jesus.

97
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:33,711
What I believe Captain
Lawrence meant to say

98
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,713
is that as long as it
takes for Miss Guthrie

99
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,846
to emerge from behind that door

100
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,645
and lift the ban on Captain Vane...

101
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,165
a decision which, a few hours ago,

102
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,605
she said would be taken
over her dead body...

103
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,887
then Captain Hornigold over there

104
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:51,552
walks away from our
nascent shipping consortium,

105
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:53,612
killing it in its cradle.

106
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,899
He withdraws his men from the street,

107
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,599
at which point Captain Lilywhite
and his mob are free to burn

108
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,327
everything in sight with
the Guthrie name on it.

109
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:01,690
All of Nassau will, most likely,

110
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:03,356
descend into fiery mayhem

111
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:06,001
from which we will all
be lucky to escape alive.

112
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,084
Every moment that that door remains closed

113
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,597
is a moment that Miss Guthrie
is considering that outcome

114
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:14,508
as a viable, even preferable alternative

115
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:17,708
to merely swallowing her pride.

116
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:22,016
I don't know.

117
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:26,689
Perhaps you need to have a
little bit more faith in people.

118
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:54,219
I'll take the good news
to Captain Lilywhite.

119
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,284
Let him know he can stand down.

120
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:14,148
Good news, everyone!

121
00:10:14,194 --> 00:10:16,694
The cunt's knuckled under.

122
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:18,813
We're back in fucking business.

123
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:21,950
You hear that, eh?

124
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,503
So what's this now?

125
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,680
She don't want no one touching the whore.

126
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,126
What the fuck's your problem?

127
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,970
Another step and I'll show you.

128
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:42,282
Mr. Hamund, permit me a
moment with our friend here.

129
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,885
Talk some sense into her, Jack.

130
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:50,931
Before she goes and does something stupid.

131
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:55,430
Tell me this is not happening.

132
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,534
Tell me you weren't
about to fight Mr. Hamund

133
00:10:58,535 --> 00:10:59,913
over that fucking whore.

134
00:10:59,914 --> 00:11:01,373
Don't call her that.

135
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:05,461
It would appear that
I've failed to appreciate

136
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:07,724
just how deeply this
situation has disturbed you.

137
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:09,754
But if you're intent on
following this course of action,

138
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:11,805
then I suppose we should
do our farewells now

139
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:13,693
because I don't think I
can stomach watching the men

140
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:16,233
throwing you into that tent as
well and having their way with you,

141
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,150
which is where I fear this story ends

142
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,357
unless you pull your shit together.

143
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,913
Captain says no light.

144
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,701
I know.

145
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:12,518
Miranda's voice: "To the honorable
Justice Addington Thomas",

146
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:14,760
Massachusetts Bay colony."

147
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:20,345
"I petition you under the
advisement of your friend

148
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,190
Mr. Richard Guthrie,

149
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:25,578
to bestow your favor and influence."

150
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:29,938
"You may know Captain
James Flint by reputation

151
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:33,295
through stories of his past misdeeds,

152
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:37,615
but you might not know
of his desire to repent.

153
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:41,134
He is a good man, a decent man,

154
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,979
eager to renounce his transgressions at sea

155
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,838
and seek life in a part of the
world willing to accept a man

156
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,002
humbled and penitent."

157
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,526
"Were such a thing possible,

158
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:55,063
would such a place exist?

159
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:59,278
It is with this very hope
that I write you today.

160
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,426
I've enclosed a bill of exchange for £500

161
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:05,486
to be spent at your discretion

162
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,841
toward procuring whatever
permissions necessary.

163
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,154
I only urge speed."

164
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,757
"He is caught in a dangerous
plot with wicked men

165
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,505
who will most certainly kill him

166
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,526
when they learn of his betrayal."

167
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:24,153
Jesus.

168
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:28,579
Miranda's voice: "Believe me,
your obliged and faithful servant,

169
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:30,229
Miranda Barlow."

170
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:55,815
Get me another plan.

171
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,572
Fuck.

172
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:03,761
I need to talk to you now.

173
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,413
I found it in Bryson's cabin.

174
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:27,034
It's from the Barlow woman.

175
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:29,752
She wants a pardon for Flint in Boston.

176
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,006
She says we're gonna kill him
when we learn of his betrayal.

177
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:34,695
And?

178
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,185
It says betrayal.

179
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:39,985
I can see that.

180
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:42,109
What do you want me to
do about it right now?

181
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:48,021
I know about the Maria Aleyne.

182
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:49,667
What?

183
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,865
I know Flint killed those people for her.

184
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,712
I know morley saw it and brought it to you.

185
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,714
And I know you did nothing.

186
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,711
He played games with
his crewmen's lives then.

187
00:15:57,712 --> 00:16:00,294
He's doing it again now and he
knows he can get away with it

188
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:01,574
because we're protecting him.

189
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:04,782
- Because you are protecting him.
- Enough.

190
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:07,025
If you want to go to the
crew with this, be my guest.

191
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:08,161
But I will do everything in my power

192
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:10,578
to frustrate you. Know that.

193
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,373
How can you say that?

194
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:14,306
Because we're in fucking battle right now

195
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,866
and I will not undermine
his control of what is,

196
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,118
frankly, a shitty situation

197
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,035
based on a letter written by a woman

198
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:24,355
neither of us know a thing about.

199
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,386
Just promise me that when
we get back to Nassau,

200
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,652
we will deal with this.

201
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,477
Everything all right?

202
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,608
Fine.

203
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,110
Billy's come up with our next move.

204
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:42,858
It's three hours till sunup.

205
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:45,677
Perhaps you'd like to share
it with the rest of us.

206
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,661
Miranda: Pastor Lambrick.

207
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:09,307
It's later than I'm
comfortable taking company.

208
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:10,888
You shouldn't be here.

209
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,930
I live here, Pastor. Or hadn't you noticed?

210
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,759
Mr. Underhill agreed
to take Mr. Guthrie in.

211
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,258
Mr. Guthrie spun such a tale for him.

212
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,206
He said he's been bribing

213
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,391
the lords proprietor in London for years.

214
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,703
Said he planned to use that fact

215
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:26,672
to extort preferential treatment from them

216
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,660
when England reasserts her rule here.

217
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,971
He promised wealth and prosperity.

218
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:34,266
Even promised to see
Underhill declared governor.

219
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,608
And that was it.

220
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,218
How nice for Mr. Guthrie.

221
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:39,922
It is nice.

222
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:43,577
He now sleeps safely on
Mr. Underhill's plantation

223
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:47,065
behind two dozen of the most
brutal overseers in the new world.

224
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,019
Behind walls and guns and swords.

225
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,233
I need no protection.

226
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,936
Mrs. Barlow,

227
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,476
Mr. Guthrie has betrayed Captain Flint.

228
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:57,414
And you've helped him to do it.

229
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:59,366
If half of what I've heard
of Captain Flint is true,

230
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:02,121
he will not react to your betrayal kindly.

231
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,882
You do not understand any of this, pastor.

232
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,714
Then help me understand.

233
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:13,592
Help me, because I
cannot in good conscience

234
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,858
walk away from here believing
you to be in such peril.

235
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,431
All right.

236
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,393
Good evening, cunt.

237
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,312
If I wanted to kill you,
I'd have done it already.

238
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:02,045
What a piece of shit you are.

239
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,422
Nose in the air.

240
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:06,408
Spoiled cunt playing at our business.

241
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,456
Pains me being this close to you.

242
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:11,730
Should tell you how fucking desperate I am.

243
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:13,643
Desperate for what?

244
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,540
- Your help.
- Beg your pardon?

245
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,948
Your friend on the beach.

246
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,952
She fucked us and that needed answering.

247
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:26,289
But then that night,

248
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:29,037
she told you to go fuck yourself.

249
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:30,973
Should have toasted her.

250
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:34,004
If she had a cock, we probably would have.

251
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:37,482
What Hamund's been doing to her...

252
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,512
Ain't right.

253
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,226
What do you want me to do about it?

254
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:46,929
I've tried to help. She didn't
want it. Now my hands are tied.

255
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,959
- I can't...
- You could kill him.

256
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:53,289
I'd do it myself, but
the men saw us feuding.

257
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,451
I go near him, I'll have
them all at my throat

258
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:57,464
and no one at my back.

259
00:19:57,638 --> 00:20:00,623
Now's the time. Captain's gone.

260
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:01,875
Don't know how long for.

261
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,226
Wait, gone? Gone where?

262
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,081
I don't know. I don't much give a shit.

263
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:07,605
Left alone on a skiff this afternoon.

264
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,163
But if he returns,

265
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:11,671
he'll be another one
standing at Hamund's side.

266
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,177
If you're already suspected by the men,

267
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:17,251
what's to say they don't suspect you

268
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:19,503
no matter how Hamund were to disappear?

269
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:21,820
What's to say that suspicion
doesn't lead to questions?

270
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,707
And what's to say those
questions don't lead to me?

271
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,982
You fucking coward.

272
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,490
Why? Because I've used my head

273
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:29,940
before making this mess even worse?

274
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:33,026
'Cause for all your
shit, all your posturing,

275
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:34,884
you won't lift a finger to help her.

276
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,097
I didn't say that.

277
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:38,805
You said my plan was too dangerous.

278
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,022
Your plan isn't dangerous enough.

279
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:46,204
Eight men left on your crew.

280
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,363
Eight men who support
Hamund. You said it yourself.

281
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:51,400
We kill him, they all
become threats to both of us.

282
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:54,620
- It's foolish.
- Then what the fuck would you suggest?

283
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,498
You want to kill Hamund,

284
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,043
then you have to kill them all.

285
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:03,955
They disappear all at once tonight

286
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:06,452
with neither of us implicated.

287
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,969
There's eight of them.

288
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,402
Their guard is up. It's impossible.

289
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:14,366
It's not impossible.

290
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,553
We just need a little help.

291
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,899
I don't know how else to say this

292
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,743
except no.

293
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,428
I suppose there's fuck, no.

294
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,778
Or fuck you.

295
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,599
I think you misunderstand.

296
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,787
I wasn't asking you to help me.

297
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,903
I was granting you the
opportunity to help me.

298
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,334
But now, because of your tone,

299
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:47,648
I'm disinclined to be so generous.

300
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,370
Beg pardon?

301
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,612
Now you'll beg me for it.

302
00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:54,941
What the fuck are you talking about?

303
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:57,172
All those days ago when you first proposed

304
00:21:57,173 --> 00:22:00,343
this arrangement of yours to Flint...

305
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:01,501
remaining with his crew,

306
00:22:01,502 --> 00:22:02,916
holding onto the last piece of the schedule

307
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,784
to ensure you weren't disposed of...

308
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:07,200
when he asked you what's
to stop him from killing you

309
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,073
when all's said and done,
do you remember your answer?

310
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:13,472
No, but I'm guessing you do.

311
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,596
I believe you said,

312
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:18,455
"we might be friends by then."

313
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,914
I'm sorry, what are you driving at?

314
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:25,169
You've spent enough time with the man now.

315
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,422
Does he strike you as the type of person

316
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:28,605
who would ever under any circumstance

317
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:31,401
leave a loose end like you walking around?

318
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:35,813
When I took your advice and
lifted the ban on Charles Vane,

319
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:39,305
I became the center of all
commerce on this island again.

320
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:42,019
Someone you don't want as an enemy.

321
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,172
Someone Flint doesn't want as an enemy.

322
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,337
The way I see it, I may be
the only person in this world

323
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:52,200
who can dissuade him from killing you.

324
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:59,875
Miranda: I had a very different life

325
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,850
before I came here,

326
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:04,969
a life I shared with my husband.

327
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:09,681
He was a special man,

328
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:11,599
a man of ideas...

329
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,405
About the world,

330
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:15,844
about the order of things.

331
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:19,965
Writers, artists, men of science...

332
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,890
they'd fill our drawing
room night after night

333
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:25,868
to talk and argue.

334
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:30,011
Sometimes just to listen to him.

335
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:33,323
In some ways he was like you...

336
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,837
a shepherd to his flock.

337
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,653
He would have loved to have met you.

338
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:42,160
Me?

339
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,621
You think I can play devil's advocate.

340
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,384
Thomas would have played that game with you

341
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,503
from dusk until dawn.

342
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,453
And everything you hold sacred,

343
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:52,726
he'd leave in tatters.

344
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:56,424
Not from malice or hate,

345
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,462
but from love.

346
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,394
From a desire to see the yoke of shame

347
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,836
lifted from your shoulders.

348
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:07,556
You think I am ashamed?

349
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,003
My husband and I were happy.

350
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,344
But in London, a happy life

351
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:18,026
can often be a very dangerous thing.

352
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:22,580
Something that other
people simply cannot abide.

353
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:28,043
Thomas learned that lesson all too well.

354
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,566
Captain Flint was Thomas's closest friend.

355
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:36,740
And after his death, he saw fit

356
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,940
to spirit me here for my own safety.

357
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,161
Flint brought you here?

358
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:45,542
You're right, I don't understand.

359
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:48,885
I just told you. Captain
Flint is my deliverer.

360
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:52,359
There's nothing more
you need to understand.

361
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,045
Why are you here?

362
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:01,501
I'm concerned for your safety.

363
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,876
It's late.

364
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:06,128
You knew I'd be alone. It's inappropriate.

365
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,249
You're not here because you
want to protect me, pastor.

366
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:17,184
You're here because you want to fuck me.

367
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:23,052
I'm sorry. We dangle?

368
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,425
Four men suspended over the side.

369
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:29,188
Axes, augers, charges.

370
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:32,522
It's a rapid penetration to
get a charge through the hole.

371
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,441
Cause disruption, distraction

372
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:38,970
while we move on the bunker
through the hold below.

373
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:40,606
Saw Avery try it once.

374
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:43,878
- And it worked?
- I said I saw it tried.

375
00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:46,725
Volunteers?

376
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,313
Paxton.

377
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,028
Bobby.

378
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:07,070
Dooly.

379
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:11,801
Logan.

380
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:18,997
Something wrong?

381
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:21,615
Even if we do hack through,

382
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:24,540
we'd be dangling there
like bait on a string.

383
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:26,347
It's suicide.

384
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:29,950
We don't have time for a debate, Mr. Logan.

385
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:31,989
Now I gave you an order.

386
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,714
And what happens when
those orders get us killed?

387
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,574
You send in four more?

388
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,466
Billy, tell him I'm right.

389
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:50,776
Mr. Logan...

390
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,693
Fall in.

391
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,023
Billy, tell him I'm right.

392
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:00,806
Captain...

393
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:05,025
Mr. Logan makes a valid point.

394
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,323
Unfortunately, now is not the time.

395
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:17,733
Anybody else got a point

396
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,971
they would like to make?

397
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:22,383
While we are in battle,

398
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,869
the Captain's orders are the law.

399
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,236
That is what we signed up to.

400
00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:28,637
That is what we agreed.

401
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:33,243
Now the order's been given.

402
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:35,520
Heed it!

403
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:45,975
Captain!

404
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:05,769
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

405
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,347
It was staring us right in the face.

406
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,184
Those cannons aren't the only thing

407
00:29:10,185 --> 00:29:11,830
Bryson has locked down there with him.

408
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,014
38 slaves.

409
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,267
You think they put that
flag there as a signal to us?

410
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,007
Well, it wasn't there three hours ago.

411
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:22,892
And if not us,

412
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:24,848
I couldn't tell you who
they are trying to signal.

413
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,485
Seven, eight...

414
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:29,112
Nine priced over £100.

415
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:32,388
That's nine strong men ready
to fight Bryson from below.

416
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:34,637
Yeah, well, you're presuming those nine men

417
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:37,011
will choose to take up
arms and join in a fight

418
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:39,619
they couldn't possibly
know or care less about.

419
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,095
Given their current situation,

420
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:43,769
my presumption is that there
are no nine men on earth

421
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,792
who wouldn't jump at the
chance for a little fight.

422
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:48,284
What, you got a better idea?

423
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,100
Well, how do you imagine we
get them out of their chains?

424
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,264
You will never see them again.

425
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,252
What?

426
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:11,724
This person you'd give
your life to protect,

427
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:15,088
give our lives to protect...

428
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:18,913
Whoever they are, you'll
never see them again.

429
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,274
You must love them very much,

430
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,714
but I do not think you
have thought this through.

431
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:25,622
You don't know me.

432
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:28,796
And you don't know what
you're talking about.

433
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,610
I know that if we reach our destination,

434
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:33,873
we may never have another chance like this.

435
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,093
There is no way.

436
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,453
You and I, we are both in this hold,

437
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,224
but we are not in the same place.

438
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:48,108
How many times must you have told yourself

439
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,010
that you're special?

440
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:54,241
That your master thinks
you're different from the rest?

441
00:30:55,573 --> 00:30:56,472
Maybe you're right.

442
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,615
But I know those men above better than you.

443
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:02,261
And when they put you in these,

444
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:04,786
they don't mean to let you go.

445
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:09,407
You have a chance to go home again,

446
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:11,033
yet you just sit there.

447
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,468
Maybe you're right.

448
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,999
You and I are not the same.

449
00:31:57,385 --> 00:31:59,484
What the fuck is going on down here?

450
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:14,397
Sir.

451
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:17,600
It's this one.

452
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:20,802
Heave!

453
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:24,635
Together, lads. And...
- Heave.

454
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:27,319
What do they think they're doing?

455
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:40,382
Come.

456
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,066
- Heave!
- Man: Again!

457
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:52,589
Heave!

458
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,144
Put your back in it, boys!

459
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:19,069
Secure the hold, Mr.
Hayes. Something's wrong.

460
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:09,218
Excuse me.

461
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:12,042
Mr. Hamund?

462
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,305
Who the fuck are you?

463
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:15,753
My name is John silver.

464
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,066
And I have a proposition for you.

465
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:19,939
I've heard your crew has
been freed to hunt again.

466
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:21,872
And I understand with
Mr. Rackham out of favor,

467
00:36:21,873 --> 00:36:23,633
you're the man the crew now looks to.

468
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:28,387
Seems our paths were meant
to meet in this moment.

469
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,651
Me with something to sell,
and you with means to use it.

470
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:33,591
Piss off.

471
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:38,590
I was the whore's partner,

472
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:41,483
the one who stole the page from Flint

473
00:36:41,484 --> 00:36:43,050
and then tried to sell it to you.

474
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:45,867
You're that new one.

475
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:48,362
The cook they took on.

476
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:49,292
That I am.

477
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:50,577
But perhaps not for long.

478
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:52,858
This is where I think you
and I can help each other.

479
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:58,372
The night the exchange was meant
to take place at the wrecks,

480
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:00,688
I lost the schedule to Captain Flint.

481
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,510
But I escaped with my hide intact

482
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:05,248
and my anonymity.

483
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:07,097
I've remained with the crew since then,

484
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:09,749
but I believe now I've
tempted fate long enough.

485
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:12,007
Flint departed, I remained.

486
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:13,957
My intent... to sell the page again

487
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:16,115
and leave Nassau with
something to show for it.

488
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:19,247
Seeing as we theoretically
already had a deal,

489
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:22,062
I thought your crew was
the logical place to start.

490
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:24,894
What the fuck are you talking about?

491
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:27,431
You just said Flint has the schedule.

492
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:29,884
He has the page the schedule is written on,

493
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:32,160
but I saw that page.

494
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:34,692
I think there's a good chance
I can remember most of it.

495
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:36,658
For the right price.

496
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,253
Are you a fucking lunatic?

497
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:41,267
What's to stop me from killing you

498
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:43,075
for getting us into this mess?

499
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:43,951
Wait.

500
00:37:44,356 --> 00:37:47,506
I am willing to give a steep
discount on our original agreement.

501
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:51,110
We don't have any fucking
money left, you shit.

502
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:54,513
Rackham lost it chasing you.

503
00:37:56,351 --> 00:37:58,701
I fail to see how that's possible.

504
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:07,773
Mr. Hamund.

505
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:09,656
May I help you?

506
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:13,347
You told us you lost
our pearls in the wrecks.

507
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:17,025
5,000 pesos worth. Isn't that right?

508
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,099
Yes.

509
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:22,623
Because now I'm told that
you gave half our pearls

510
00:38:22,624 --> 00:38:24,236
to the whore up front

511
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:27,442
before you ever left for the wrecks.

512
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:37,405
Which would mean that half the
pearls never went to the wrecks.

513
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:43,384
They was on the whore when
your bitch reeled her in.

514
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:46,741
Leaving us to wonder

515
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:50,129
where the fuck are they now?

516
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,148
I don't know where you're
getting your information from,

517
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:57,098
but I can assure you, it is mistaken.

518
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:59,334
She threw that whore in the tent

519
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:01,066
long before we got to her.

520
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:03,454
Yes, but the whore had no pearls.

521
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:05,122
Neither I nor miss bonny

522
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,026
would be so stupid as to steal from you.

523
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,827
And even if I were, I would
certainly never be so stupid

524
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:11,587
as to trust a whore to act as escrow.

525
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:12,949
Someone is lying to you.

526
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,292
If you tell me who it was,

527
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:16,947
I might be able to help you figure out why.

528
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:20,739
I'd tell you, Jack...

529
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,951
But I don't see how that much matters

530
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:27,845
seeing that we found these

531
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:30,864
in your tent just now.

532
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:34,705
Look at you now.

533
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:39,713
Where's the fucking rest of them?

534
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:42,592
Buried.

535
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:44,797
By the wrecks.

536
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:48,518
Darling.

537
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:51,583
I'm so very disappointed in you.

538
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,106
I believe I'm entitled to this.

539
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,323
I've arranged a room for you.

540
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:25,117
I don't imagine I'll be doing much sleeping

541
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,227
till I know this is
finished, thank you very much.

542
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:30,372
Thought I'd wait it out
here, if you don't mind.

543
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:40,269
- Heave ho!
- Pull!

544
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:42,478
Come on! That's it!

545
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:43,933
Heave!

546
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,807
All right, lads, coming over.

547
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:48,612
Man 2: Coming over.

548
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:50,167
Man 3: Okay, that's good.

549
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,474
I certainly didn't expect
to find you down in the hold.

550
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:03,952
Not after you betrayed miss
Guthrie on behalf of her father.

551
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:08,460
Our agreement was

552
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:10,897
I would stay behind to
protect Eleanor from you.

553
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:16,283
You think what she and I hope to achieve

554
00:41:16,284 --> 00:41:18,144
for Nassau is impossible.

555
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,811
That I'll be the death of her?

556
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,518
I lost six men chasing down this ship.

557
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,930
Nearly faced another mutiny all over again.

558
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,149
If I had any sense, I'd
throw you to my crew.

559
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:39,271
Take the pressure off me.

560
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:43,119
But I'm not gonna do that.

561
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:48,377
I'd rather prove you wrong.

562
00:42:12,172 --> 00:42:13,066
Billy.

563
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:17,008
Stow the guns in the lower hold.

564
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:19,117
- Favor the starboard.
- Of course.

565
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:20,425
Right, Billy.

566
00:42:25,968 --> 00:42:28,756
What? Afraid I got loose lips?

567
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,078
Please, son, I am on your side.

568
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,182
You've got to believe that.

569
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,102
Then get some answers.

570
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:46,461
Come on!

571
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,738
- Heave!
- Crew: Heave ho.

572
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,938
That's it. Hold on.

573
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:57,901
Lend a hand, mate.

574
00:42:57,902 --> 00:42:59,698
Perfectly good stash of powder here.

575
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:17,137
You all right?

576
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:24,216
She saw us.

577
00:43:24,994 --> 00:43:26,392
The Scarborough had to have seen us.

578
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,839
There's still great guns in the hold.

579
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,746
At least three or four more.

580
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:34,757
There's no time for delay.

581
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:37,612
The guns we've unloaded
already will have to suffice.

582
00:43:37,807 --> 00:43:40,752
Cut us loose! We're getting out of here.

583
00:43:46,717 --> 00:43:47,825
Come on!

584
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:11,888
What the hell is that?

585
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,749
It's the Andromache's spritsail brace.

586
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:18,099
It must have blown loose
during the explosion.

587
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,599
That's two knots or
more it'll drag us down.

588
00:44:40,818 --> 00:44:41,627
Earlier...

589
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:46,669
When you and Mr. gates were having words,

590
00:44:47,372 --> 00:44:48,634
you mentioned a letter.

591
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:53,270
What was in it, Billy?

592
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:04,351
Billy!

593
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,106
What was in it?

594
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,121
I think you know what was in it.

595
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,293
Oh, shit!

596
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:29,686
Hard to starboard. Bring us about.

597
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:37,893
Man overboard!

598
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:40,765
Man overboard!

599
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:45,348
It's Billy. He fell.

600
00:45:47,486 --> 00:45:49,932
- Billy!
- Billy!

601
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:51,587
Any sign of him?

602
00:46:00,978 --> 00:46:02,513
We can't turn back.

603
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:09,360
She'll tear us to pieces.

604
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,097
Ambush, I presume.

605
00:46:39,306 --> 00:46:42,246
Nothing out there but men
with pistols and swords.

606
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:46,191
I imagine those pearls didn't
just materialize out of thin air.

607
00:46:46,192 --> 00:46:47,484
With whom did you scheme this?

608
00:46:47,913 --> 00:46:48,983
The cunt.

609
00:46:51,354 --> 00:46:52,825
Somehow I'm not surprised.

610
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:57,665
Decent fellow, Slade, as far as I know.

611
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,237
Never raised a hand against the whore.

612
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:01,797
A factor I hope you considered
before you decided that he

613
00:47:01,798 --> 00:47:04,364
and six other men who stood by
our Captain in his darkest hour,

614
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:06,324
men he considers his brothers,

615
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:07,864
be lumped into the cost

616
00:47:07,865 --> 00:47:09,697
of assuaging your offense in this matter.

617
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:12,630
God damn it, Anne.

618
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,767
Do I not deserve a say about this?

619
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:18,356
You had your say.

620
00:47:19,563 --> 00:47:20,864
Now I'll have mine.

621
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:40,586
This way.

622
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,744
You know, when I first met you,

623
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,735
I pegged you for an easy mark.

624
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:17,498
But now, between you and Flint,

625
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,585
I'm not certain who I
should be more afraid of.

626
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:27,119
I saw you earlier.

627
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:29,644
After you lifted the ban.

628
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:36,516
You were angry.

629
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,612
Not just about Max.

630
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:44,125
Those men out there,

631
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:46,858
they made you admit you were wrong.

632
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,489
They made you feel weak.

633
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,676
I think you felt compelled

634
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:57,958
to let everyone on this island know

635
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:00,226
that in this place,

636
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,779
no one fucks with you
and gets away with it.

637
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,147
Thank you

638
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:08,604
for what you did for me.

639
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,225
I didn't do it for you.

640
00:51:02,355 --> 00:51:05,069
Dufresne: Old Jim Carver.

641
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:16,141
Sebastian Frakes.

642
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,146
William "Bones" Manderly.

643
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:31,932
Huzzah!

644
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:10,666
I hope you're pleased with yourself.

645
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:16,093
I see. We won't be speaking
of this again, I presume.

646
00:52:17,382 --> 00:52:20,018
Well, before we close the lid
on this and put it in the ground,

647
00:52:20,243 --> 00:52:22,253
one last question if you will,

648
00:52:22,254 --> 00:52:24,033
just to satisfy my curiosity.

649
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,909
When you and Miss Guthrie
were plotting this little coup,

650
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:32,824
when she asked you, "well, shit, Anne,

651
00:52:32,825 --> 00:52:33,732
what makes you think old Jack

652
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,743
will go along with this plan of ours

653
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:36,329
and not plead the truth to his men

654
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,644
as he's most certainly going

655
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:40,839

658
00:52:50,315 --> 00:52:52,069
That's very fucking touching.

659
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,341

You don't know where he's gone, do you?

663
00:53:09,825 --> 00:53:11,480
He ain't coming back.
